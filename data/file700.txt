7000004 it s a little disappointing i i mean you know john mccain likes to characterize himself as a maverick but the truth is what he s done particularly over the last month when he shook up his campaign is he basically hired karl rove s old old crew and adopted karl rove s old tactics which really had to do with suggesting that i was unpatriotic

7000012 however the treatment may not be the right answer for every couple it involves a complex programme that can take up to a year and it is important that there are limitations where there may be clinical or other risks

7000021 we got into a rhythm early and our tempo was good
7000022 the game kind of flowed a little bit where last week maybe i was pressing a little much because i really wanted to play well this week i realized i needed to go through my progressions and get the ball to the backs and when nobody is open down field
7000023 i was just a little quicker getting to those decisions tonight instead of last week when i was holding the ball a little too long
7000024 i thought he was sharp i thought he managed the offense the tempo was smart with the football and was very good on third down i thought it was important for our offense to come out and establish some tempo and have some productivity early in the game we were able to do that and continue it for four quarters
7000025 last week i dont think i took the checkdowns as much as i should have i just wanted to take what the defense gave me i know it is clich but its the truth especially on more than one occasion we had the checkdown go for big yardage i just wanted to get the ball out of my hand quickly and throw for a high percentage
7000026 we got back to playing packer football thats making plays laid back relaxed but focused and it was a lot of fun tonight
7000027 we won and thats a positive but i dont think we did such a great job defensively
7000028 i tell you what its a good thing the offense moved the ball and they didnt have the ball that much because it seemed like they scored on every possession they had the ball in the first half weve got to step up and we cant let that happen
7000029 the strength of our defense has always been third down we werent as sharp tonight as we have been and we need to tackle better thats two weeks in a row
7000030 the run defense was not as productive as it has been but getting off the field on third down thats the strength of our defense were better than we showed on that particular drive and well take full advantage of it and learn from it
7000031 after all of the momentum we had coming off of last year we need to pick it up because right now we are not carrying it with us
7000032 were supposed to have a strong defense this year and were supposed to be carrying the team and were not doing it right now
7000033 its always a concern when it happens what type of concern is it is it peoples gaps or is it kind of the scheme stuff we dont really know thats why well have to take a look at it on film its something that we obviously have to get fixed
7000034 any time you win a game its important to recognize that
7000035 success is hard to achieve in this league regardless of what time of year you do win football games
7000036 i think we had a good rhythm going and thats what we came over here to do
7000037 we wanted to set the tone and set the tempo and move the ball down the field and make plays and get scores
7000038 i think we were able to come out and establish what we wanted to establish i felt great any time you can get out there after not being out there since last year its definitely a big boost for myself and my confidence and just for the team
7000039 its great having greg back and one of the guys who benefits the most is donald because he really takes a lot of pressure off donald because a lot of teams roll coverage to donald when greg is not in
7000040 denver has got a set of great corners starters champ bailey and dr bly but i like our guys as well
7000041 i think i criticized myself more than anything else and i like that because that makes me play the next week
7000042 i had a couple of drops in the first two preseason games and this week i felt i had to come out and prove to everyone that hey i can catch the ball
7000043 i think the biggest thing with us was to come out and start fast last week we didnt play well at all it seemed like we didnt know each other but today it seemed like we knew each other pretty well the good thing about it was to get greg and ruvell back it took a lot of pressure off of me and james jones now we just got back in our same positions and we just played football

7000143 im really pleased with two tries to none and when we were good we were very good but there are things there such as the contact and set piece we obviously have to work on but this is pre season and this is the test we need
7000144 all the feedback im getting is that harry will be fine
7000145 it was one of those games that you needed to turn it on i think everybody felt that even the novices that dont know as much as coaches do and i think we did
7000146 i thought we were efficient it was nice to play more than a series or two
7000147 its exciting to come out in the first half and move the ball like we did
7000148 they provided a lot of different looks we dont see on a day to day basis
7000149 there are a lot of things to learn from this film
7000150 all the feedback im getting is that harry will be fine
7000151 theres a long ways to go here its fun to be bouncing back and forth i mean it would be nicer to get up there where the angels are and get a big lead but all we can do is control our games and go out and play them and do the best we can gardenhire said
7000152 hopefully well stay in this thing the whole way thats what we plan on doing and well go from there
7000153 everybodys been talking about this road trip and how we dont play as well on the road as we do at home perkins said alluding to the twins four city 14 game swing
7000154 so to get off to a good start on this trip is definitely going to help us going forward into the next couple of series
7000155 he used his changeup well pitched on the inner half of the plate very well and gave our guys a chance to get going offensively
7000156 span and delmon had a heck of a night driving the ball for us gardenhire said
7000157 delmon got a pitch out and over the plate and he crushed that ball weve seen this guy do this a few times this year he can flip a ball up in the stands with the best of them
7000158 he pitched a good game but its more than just perkins its been the way for us the last nine games weve played terrific baseball for so long up to this point we just have to get back into our game
7000159 this is not anything thats going to take a major overhaul we just need a few tweaks here and there some guys are gripping the bat too tight squeezing sawdust out of it we just have to refocus and get back to playing the game
7000160 smaller countries that are able to target and focus their resources on a relatively small number of sports events can compete for medals on the international landscape

7000162 the country that has probably moved the most is great britain
7000163 three years ago the u k was characterized by having a disjointed system two years ago they started to get their act together
7000164 theres a long ways to go here its fun to be bouncing back and forth i mean it would be nicer to get up there where the angels are and get a big lead but all we can do is control our games and go out and play them and do the best we can gardenhire said

7000173 i remember being the younger one where i just came in and whatever minutes you get you play hard
7000174 i will have done all that i can do to represent the country im sure its my last one and its been really emotional for me its an awesome experience to be able to represent our country and to be on such a fine team
7000175 i always admired lisa i always liked her because she was tall and had good moves
7000176 when i first played with her i thought wow thats lisa leslie i was like a fan like can i take a picture and get an autograph i cant do that shes my teammate its a very humbling experience at the same time you cant ask for nothing better
7000177 obviously syl is the future and lisa has had the best talent in the world for so long which she still is on any given night the best player on the court and she has been in this tournament for us syl has this amazing athletic ability and once she gets it together shell be a scary sight a scary scary sight
7000178 you throw it up there sylvias going to get it
7000179 i think i finally felt it for the first time
7000180 i got emotional i didnt want anybody to see me tear up so i sat in the back for a little while just thinking about this whole thing all that we went through all the struggles and fights and hard work we had to do to get here
7000181 we have only one goal the gold medal so only the gold medal counts every country varies but in china only the gold medal counts
7000182 of course it should be based on gold medals the american method doesnt count china is no 1
7000183 of course the gold medals because when you win the gold meal you can see the national flag and hear the national anthem
7000184 we should give each medal a score like three points for gold two for silver and one for bronze add them up and get the winner it shouldnt just be based on gold medals or total medals
7000185 everything should be taken into account the medals and the performances like hurdler liu xiang who was injured before the olympics he still came out and tried to compete the games should be judged on the overall experience
7000186 i think the gold should have a point like a higher point system for example the gold is worth five points the silver three points and the bronze one point and then sum it up that way that would be a better way even if you play go kart racing like mario kart the gold is worth more the silver is second then third then you add them all up and you compete with other people with the total score
7000187 the purpose of the olympics is not to count the medals the purpose of the olympics is to compete we went to swimming yesterday and there was a swimmer who finished 10 minutes late and he finished everyone cheered him it was raining it was terrible weather i think the medal count is a u s phenomenon that is incorrect the correct measure of the olympics is to just compete and finish
7000188 by the gold because were third in the table and were beating australia we dont get many golds so were doing well
7000189 the proper way it to count by gold medals the importance is to be no 1 i dont think counting the total is correct

7000216 nooit eerder won een belgische vrouw een medaille op de spelen in de atletiek
7000217 nu waren ze met vier of drie plus n want kim gevaert kreeg het mooiste afscheidscadeau dat ze zich kon dromen
7000218 kom niet af dat de favorieten uit de vs en jamaica in de fout gingen ze moeten hun huiswerk maar maken
7000219 dit is de verdienste van alle vier maar toch was dit nooit iets geworden zonder gevaert
7000220 olivia borl e hanna mari n elodie ouedraogo en kim gevaert zijn de reddende engelen van belgi onze eerste olympische medaille s en dan nog meteen zilver ook dank u dames voor het redden van onze eer en trots
7000221 kim gevaert en haar succesploeg zorgden voor een verlossing voor het hele land ze liepen een droomkoers
7000222 belgi kan onze meisjes niet genoeg bedanken dat ze de druk om zonder een medaille terug te keren hebben weggenomen
7000223 girl power heeft het gezicht van belgi gered in het internationale geweld
7000224 dat de vs jamaica en groot brittanni hun stokje niet kunnen vasthouden maakt onze rekening niet belgi heeft daarop getraind

7000234 the great thing about joe biden during the alito hearings the reason he is to me actually endearing is that as he speaks as he goes on and on and spins his long statements hypotheticals and free associations as he demonstrates yet again as he did in the roberts hearings and even the thomas hearings that he is incapable of staying on the river of a thought and is constantly lured down tributaries from which he can never quite work his way back you can see him batting the little paddles of his mind against the weeds trying desperately to return to the river but not remembering where it is or where it was going i love him hes human like a garrulous uncle after a drink
7000235 well i hope you dont still hold that view man
7000236 o my people worship allah ye have no other god but him now hath come unto you a clear sign from your lord this she camel of allah is a sign unto you so leave her to graze in allahs earth and let her come to no harm or ye shall be seized with a grievous punishment
7000237 and remember how he made you inheritors after the ad people and gave you habitations in the land ye build for yourselves palaces and castles in open plains and care out homes in the mountains so bring to remembrance the benefits ye have received from allah and refrain from evil and mischief on the earth
7000238 know ye indeed that salih is a messenger from his lord
7000239 we do indeed believe in the revelation which hath been sent through him
7000240 o salih bring about thy threats if thou art a messenger of allah
7000241 o my people i did indeed convey to you the message for which i was sent by my lord i gave you good counsel but ye love not good counselors
7000242 do ye commit lewdness such as no people in creation ever committed before you
7000243 for ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds
7000244 drive them out of your city these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure
7000245 khatib e anbiya his name is mentioned 11 times in the quran
7000246 and squat not on every road breathing threats hindering from the path of allah those who believe in him and seeking in it something crooked but remember how ye were little and he gave you increase and hold in your minds eye what was the end of those who did mischief
7000247 o shuaib we shall certainly drive thee out of our city thee and those who believe with thee or else ye thou and they shall have to return to our ways and religion
7000248 we should indeed invent a lie against allah if we returned to your ways after allah hath rescued us there from nor could we by any manner of means return thereto unless it be as in the will and plan of allah our lord our lord can reach out to the utmost recesses of things by his knowledge in the allah is our trust our lord decide thou between us and our people in truth for thou art the best to decide
7000249 if ye follow shuaib be sure then ye are ruined
7000250 o my people i did indeed convey to you the messages for which i was sent by my lord i gave you good counsel but how shall i lament over a people who refuse to believe

7000269 glad to see you keeping an eye on this bloke but calling him a patent troll is like calling george bush a right wing politician
7000270 schestowitz he flies in leading scientist engineers technologists puts them in a room writes down everything they say and then patents every noun and verb worse he is not your usual stupid greedy troll hes already worth hundreds of millions and reasonably bright i really dont know why he does this its like cutting down the amazon for sheer malicious pleasure

7000281 ive had time to think about the past year and now feel its my duty to raise awareness of this type of cancer which lacks publicity

7000285 we always have time enough if we will but use it aright
7000286 is this task in the top 20 of my activities or in the bottom 80
7000287 our mission is to enrich the lives of children and adults through effective language learning exposure this will be effectively achieved by continuous dedication to excellence in education and by using proven and successful teaching methods which enable the learner to have a positive and worthwhile language learning experience
7000288 the class allows young children to develop their new language skills by interacting and participating together classes are thematically structured and communicative based promoting childrens ability to be creative and imaginative as they expand their verbal skills stimulating games music rhythms games and other educational activities are used to present new knowledge and help to develop skills
7000289 it is as if sportsmen and women have a higher base level of sexual energy but why can it be that one of the underlying drivers of sporting greatness is also the very thing that produces an overactive sex drive
7000290 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
7000291 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
7000292 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
7000293 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
7000294 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
7000295 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
7000296 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
7000297 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
7000298 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in and how about the men why not bring in compulsory lycra bike pants instead of the baggy shorts many men wear currently
7000299 if the university retrieved simple record of its students it was unfortunate as records emanating from the school could not be relied upon
7000300 our concern is whether uniabuja would want to sacrifice its image the interest of its students and indeed the image of the country at large for alhaji ibrahim idris because one day idris would vacate the office of the kogi state governor he is presently occupying through the pdp
7000301 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna

7000303 i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
7000304 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
7000305 since 2005 rihanna has been sponsored by the likes of jc penny samsung covergirl secret venus breeze and so on and has gone on two major tours most recently kanye wests glow in the dark tour
7000306 all of it was spent on making her as big as she is now

7000373 costs look pretty good compared to natural gas power public policy climate concern and new technology are driving it too
7000374 you could supply the entire us with the sun power here in a little piece of the southwest
7000375 if america doesnt do this if we dont install many more of these clean solar power systems well just end up seeing a lot more fossil fuel plants instead
7000376 whats different now from the 80s and 90s is that we have much higher natural gas prices than back then
7000377 i dont think people foresee a serious drop in natural gas prices now even if they fell 30 percent csp would look attractive
7000378 arizona public service really does want to put this solar thermal plant in because in the future this really could replace natural gas
7000379 theyre the first to say that once this plant is installed the fuel is free
7000380 what were seeing with all these companies lining up for solar thermal is hugely promising
7000381 but without the itc all of these solar thermal plants will be put on hold

7000424 im going to do an erotic shoot of a submissive woman and you are exactly the type of woman i have in mind the images would only be used in a private collection so you wouldnt have to worry about having your pictures plastered all over the internet or in magazines
7000425 i assure you my offer is legitimate you would sign a contract and collect a fee of one thousand dollars which i think is quite generous for an afternoon of your time
7000426 well im not sure i mean ive never considered doing something like this before
7000427 believe me i can see you have all the attributes im looking for you would be perfect for the job
7000428 i tell you what think about my offer for a couple of days and if you are interested give me a call i need to know by wednesday so if i dont hear from you by then i will find someone else
7000429 uh yes hello this is lisa parsons im the woman you met in the supermarket
7000430 you offered me a job to model for a shoot you have this coming weekend
7000431 oh yeah right if you want the job its yours
7000432 thats why im calling ive decided i would like to do it
7000433 fine ill need you on saturday from ten in the morning to about three or four in the afternoon
7000434 good show up well rested and make sure you shave your legs and armpits the night before wear your hair and makeup just like you had it the other day
7000435 i mean i i dont normally shave my ah you know my privates
7000436 theres no need to be shy about it ill be seeing you in the altogether soon enough dont worry about shaving your pussy lisa ill take a look at it and if it needs any trimming ill let you know
7000437 it doesnt matter i have a wardrobe of things you can wear for the shoot any other questions
7000438 no i dont think so i guess i will see you saturday
7000439 fine call me if you have any other questions if not ill see you then
7000440 i wasnt sure how long it would take me to get here i hope thats alright
7000441 it will give you a chance to look over the contract while i get me some coffee
7000442 have a read through these and let me know if you have any questions
7000443 my methods are quite unorthodox lisa most photographers dont physically touch their models they simply direct them to assume certain poses i find that to get the effect i want in erotic photography i need freedom to touch and manipulate your body i need to be able to arouse you and your arousal will come through in the photos by signing the contract you are basically turning your body over to me during the shoot i intend to touch you as intimately as i see fit in order to accomplish that goal however as it states you wont be forced to do anything against your will you can say stop at any time do you have any objection to those terms
7000444 good if you will sign the contract we can get started
7000445 im going to start with a few photos of you while you undress for me
7000446 just remember i am a pro at this if you
7000447 thats easy for you to say youre not the one whos going to be naked
7000448 let me make it a bit easier for you dont think of this as a photo shoot think of it as a play and you are the star actress first you have to get into character and for that you need some background information for this shoot i need a woman who is submissive willing to do whatever is necessary to please her man
7000449 yes it does so just for today pretend that you are a cavewoman turn yourself over to me and pretend that i am your lover and i expect you to do whatever it takes to please me you are mine your body belongs to me and everything you do should be designed to bring me pleasure
7000450 imagine that its just you and me no camera you desperately to please me my approval is all that matters in the world now take your hair down for me
7000451 now your blouse take it off just for me tease me by taking your time with the buttons

7000536 there are lots of times that im looking on tv and a lot of fighters dont get credit for their punches

7000538 out of those five three have to score that punch and sometimes it doesnt come out that way they should go back to paper scoring
7000539 the people wont follow him and his legacy as much as he goes on in life but people would appreciate it if he fought someone like an antonio margarito and go out that way they will remember him for that
7000540 i think it will hurt him if he fights manny pacquiao and leaves his legacy on that last fight that is something oscar has to work out for himself to see how he wants to leave the fight game what is better to fight a manny pacquiao and leave that way or fighting antonio margarito

7000544 if the money is something we cant refuse it would be a big factor
7000545 but it wouldnt be my first choice because i dont know if i want to put him in right away with marquez again i think he can get an easier fight with arce a fight to come back with after a year layoff

7000591 there is a similarity to when he was a young coach

7000662 i spent a large amount of time failing to find anything and a small amount succeeding

7000664 i put it on blogger a free google blog service and went out to dinner and the world came calling
7000665 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies on this case and theyve been working with the chinese national federation to have a full clarification on this topic
7000666 on receipt of these documents the fig will forward its conclusions to the international olympic committee it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all

7000672 as soon as people hear us speak arabic on the street were stopped by the police and idd
7000673 while i understand that they have security fears when it happens again and again and again in all areas of our lives it can drive you crazy
7000674 even though we live here as full citizens were constantly made to feel different which doesnt create the possibility of feeling part of the whole
7000675 i dont care if its an arab or a jew in charge of the government
7000676 so long as i get my full rights and am treated like a human being here
7000677 given the racism the jews have faced throughout their history they have a duty to learn from that and not discriminate against non jews here now that theyre in charge of the country
7000678 its our land its where our fathers grandfathers and great grandfathers came from someone else took over and now you ask why we dont leave
7000679 since youre all your movements youth leaders of tomorrow its your duty to deal with the complications that come from jews being given a homeland here
7000680 we have asked for their immediate release and are continuing to follow their cases closely
7000681 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7000682 barack has chosen sen joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on www barackobama com spread the word
7000683 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7000684 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7000685 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone
7000686 we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7000687 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7000688 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7000689 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
7000690 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
7000691 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom
7000692 it was a dream game all i could think of was thank god the ball went over the line and now thanks to that i have a gold medal
7000693 we didnt play our best football today but this victory is a good one for us
7000694 the fact that we have been to the athletes village and met famous sportsmen its all an experience that we will not forget quickly
7000695 messi terrorises not only our team but all teams in europe he didnt score but he created a lot of their chances that is why we have the silver and they have the gold
7000696 were very disappointed but it means we came second in the olympic games we had a lot of good scoring chances but you have to score goals to win the gold medal
7000697 the south west pipeline will extend from bunbury to albany via bridgetown and manjimup at a cost of around 225 million with construction expected to begin in the first term of a liberal government
7000698 this could allow renewable energy projects to be installed without the need for expensive transmission system upgrades to support additional capacity
7000699 this would be particularly relevant for wind projects that have high prospects in the region
7000700 as flawed today as when he announced it in 2000 and 2005
7000701 why cant mr barnett say what the operating subsidy will cost it is reckless and irresponsible to pursue this project without telling taxpayers what they will be up for
7000702 mr barnett has also failed to take into account the cost of acquiring easements for the pipelines construction
7000703 and he has failed to factor in the cost of expanding the existing dampier to bunbury gas pipeline which is already at capacity
7000704 it shows mr barnett hasnt learned the lessons from his kimberley canal pipedream
7000705 this is not an energy policy it is another of mr barnetts vanity projects
7000706 this is the man who was so unconcerned about the states energy security that he sold off the dampier to bunbury gas pipeline and alintagas
7000707 planning for the centre has been under way since 2005 when the labor government endorsed the concept and committed 5 million to the project
7000708 coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives an investigation has been directed
7000709 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred
7000710 19 women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
7000711 innocently martyring at least 70 people most of them women and children
7000712 have not yet brought a fruitful conclusion and our civilians are victims of anti terrorist operations
7000713 the first rule of any counter insurgency operating by any military force is do no harm
7000714 so it is a matter of concern that early reports seem to indicate that there has been a large number of civilian casualties

7000716 what the photographs herein reveal is that china is not just one place one people but 33 distinct regions populated by 56 different ethnicities each with their own languages customs and lifestyles
7000717 it is my most sincere hope that this book unites the people immortalized in its pages tibetan pilgrims and beijing scholars uyghur muslims and shanghai bankers hong kong millionaires and shanxi miners in celebration of their glorious cultures
7000718 tom carter is an extraordinary photographer whose powerful work captures the heart and soul of the chinese people

7000725 brent nickersons a very smart and heady player a good technician he knows the scheme inside and out

7000727 it is unbelievable in there everyone is totally crazy once they are out of their competitions god knows what it is going to be like this weekend it is like a world within a world
7000728 the swimmers finished earlier in the week and it was like there was an eruption
7000729 as a statement of intent by a new british leader
7000730 our efforts on non proliferation will be dangerously undermined if others believe however unfairly that the terms of the grand bargain between nuclear and non nuclear states have changed that the nuclear weapon states have abandoned any commitment to disarmament
7000731 when it will be useful to include in negotiations the 1 of the worlds nuclear weapons that belong to the uk we will willingly do so
7000732 very clear and up front that when the political conditions existed we would give up our remaining nuclear weapons
7000733 the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons undimmed

7000753 it is highly unlikely joey will be involved with us before fa hearing
7000754 what we have got to do with joey is just try to assess where his fitness is
7000755 it is all right to come in and play a game but how will he react after it
7000756 if he was fit enough and looked strong enough and put himself up for selection that way i would play him before then
7000757 but at the moment it is looking unlikely just because of the work he has missed
7000758 girls are like apples on trees the best ones are at the top of the tree the boys dont want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt instead they just get the rotten apples from the ground that arent as good but easy so the apples at the top think something is wrong with them when in reality theyre amazing they just have to wait for the right boy to come along the one whos brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the tree
7000759 dat zandpad ligt er al heel lang en was onlosmakelijk aan de koop verbonden de ondergrond is dus ons eigendom maar omdat het pad deel uit maakt van de kapelweg is het dus een openbare weg
7000760 jaren geleden heeft de gemeente aan het begin van de kapelweg echter al bordjes doodlopende weg geplaatst omdat het zandpad ongeschikt is voor gebruik door gemotoriseerd verkeer sindsdien werd het pad eigenlijk alleen nog door fietsers gebruikt
7000761 dat leidde al snel tot steeds meer sluip en autoverkeer op de kapelweg met alle gevolgen van dien voor de omwonenden en het zandpad
7000762 overleg tussen de omwonenden en de gemeente leidde uiteindelijk tot de afspraak dat het gedeelte met het zandpad met ijzeren paaltjes wordt afgesloten zodat autos er niet meer langs kunnen alleen brommers en fietsers kunnen er dan nog gebruik van maken
7000763 hoewel mijn vader er indertijd wel voor heeft betaald zouden wij het zandpad in het kader van de ruilverkaveling gratis moeten overdragen aan de gemeente een vorm van kapitaalvernietiging dus dat bracht mij op een idee dat volgens mij voor alle partijen acceptabel is door het pad om te ploegen en bij het weiland te betrekken behouden wij onze grond de gemeente hoeft geen geld uit te geven voor nieuwe paaltjes de omwonenden zijn definitief verlost van het autoverkeer en fietsers kunnen gebruik blijven maken van het overgebleven fietspad
7000764 muchos de los compromisos generados con el acuerdo nacional por la seguridad la justicia y la legalidad ya se est n aplicando en ecatepec como hacer una reestructuraci n del rea de seguridad con la capacitaci n y depuraci n de los elementos intensificaci n del patrullaje trabajo de inteligencia atenci n de todos los delitos modernizaci n del equipo y la construcci n del centro de inteligencia y seguridad p blica

7001050 both of our ships are flying greek flags in international waters and we are victims of electronic piracy
7001051 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7001052 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7001053 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7001054 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community

7001060 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7001061 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7001062 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7001063 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7001064 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7001065 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7001066 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7001077 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7001078 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7001079 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats

7001082 well have one last good faith attempt in terms of a private meeting between the prime minister and opposition leaders
7001083 is trying to save face trying to find an excuse to once again break his word this time on the fixed election date law
7001084 the official excuse that parliament is not functioning is phony
7001085 what is true is that the prime minister does not want people to realize he has ethical problems in his government and to what extent he has badly prepared us as a country for the economic slowdown we face
7001086 if he pulls the plug on the parliament without even having the members of the house come back to their seats and show what they can do then hes showing contempt for the democratic institutions and for the fact that canadians did not elect him to a majority government only to a minority

7001099 we are doing today what we have said consistently over the last few years we are constantly looking for combinations that improve cis business from a scale and distribution point of view
7001100 if the 1 5 billion figure is right it would boost tier 1 capital by about 45 basis points
7001101 more capital leverage to do something abroad scotia management have said several times they will continue to look at acquisitions and historically scotia are well known for buying assets when they were cheap
7001102 would get it a share of a more successful assent manager than they have been themselves
7001103 odds of such a deal occurring are very low ci would certainly benefit from owning and managing scotias mutual fund business
7001104 would likely be far less attractive for either sun life financial a major shareholder of ci or scotiabank
7001105 being worst in class to having a major stake in a premium asset manager

7001109 in montreal most of the iv drug users are heroin addicts so they use a lot of syringes
7001110 usually they have no place to inject their drugs so they do it on the streets or in dark places they use dirty syringes and dirty material and its quite easy to catch hiv or the hepatitis c virus
7001111 theres a question of public opinion but we are also concerned about the fact that there is no consensus in the medical community about this
7001112 so right now we dont have enough information to go ahead
7001113 this decision was made in ignorance not by science or the facts
7001114 this is the team were chasing so we needed to come in here and win the series and try to sweep them
7001115 obviously we cant do the sweep but weve still got a chance to win the series
7001116 i thought from the start he just struggled with his control
7001117 he has to be on with his control otherwise hes going to have problems
7001118 theyve been getting good pitching all year and theyre hitting the ball now so i think theyre a lot better than their record
7001119 mostly because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with for the last 24 hours
7001120 theres been a lot of lot of doubt in my mind the kind of thing that ive never dealt with before thats a little victory for me today
7001121 i ended up lying around and tossing and turning a lot which probably isnt the best way to deal with something like that but i didnt know what else to do
7001122 i had four or five cold showers that didnt do anything either

7001126 i think we all agree that gpa is only a measurement of how much work you do right
7001127 if you have a high gpa and a low sat it should actually be bad because it shows that although you work hard you still fail no offense to anyone however if you score high on the sat but get a low gpa it shows you have the potential and ablilty to do the work and people can change so you might learn to work hard
7001128 the chance of getting into a top business school is 10 to 15
7001129 if you make good choices during the application process you can up it to 80
7001130 for students whose academic records are admirable but not perfect the college search can be an opportunity to shake off the myopic focus on brand name institutions
7001131 the goal is to find that ideal fit that great institution that is best for each individual
7001132 for a student with a b plus average to hear that harvard university is admitting 9 percent of its applicants the response may be how can i ever get into college
7001133 notes friedhoff but the average admission rate at u s colleges and universities stands at 70 percent and the numbers for many schools speak for themselves allegheny accepted about 57 percent of its applicants in 2007 purdue university nearly 79 percent and evergreen all but 3 percent
7001134 it doesnt hold you back to go to a college that is lesser known
7001135 in fact it can be just the opposite it can be the thing that will assist you dramatically there are opportunities for b students to shine and be the top of their class
7001136 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7001137 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7001138 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7001139 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7001140 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7001141 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7001142 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7001143 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7001144 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7001145 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7001146 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7001147 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7001148 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7001149 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7001150 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7001151 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7001152 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7001153 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7001154 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7001155 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7001156 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7001157 who are open to doing something on the production side
7001158 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7001159 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7001160 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7001161 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7001162 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7001163 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7001164 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7001165 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7001166 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7001167 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7001168 we are going ahead with our indefinite agitation and we are strengthening it further

7001183 my fellow americans as you all know the defeat of the iraq regime has been completed since congress does not want to spend any more money on this war our mission in iraq is complete this morning i gave the order for a complete removal of all american forces from iraq this action will be complete within 30 days it is now time to begin the reckoning before me i have two lists one list contains the names of countries which have stood by our side during the iraq conflict this list is short the united kingdom spain bulgaria australia and poland are some of the countries listed there the other list contains every one not on the first l ist most of the worlds nations are on that list my press secretary will be distributing copies of both lists later this evening let me start by saying that effective immediately foreign aid to those nations on list 2 ceases immediately and indefinitely the money saved during the first year alone will pretty much pay for the costs of the iraqi war then every year there after itll go to our social security system so it wont go broke in 20 years the american people are no longer going to pour money into third world hell holes and watch those government leaders grow fat on corruption need help with a famine wrestling with an epidemic call france in the future together with congress i will work to redirect this money toward solving the vexing social problems we still have at home on that note a word to terrorist organizations screw with us and we will hunt you down and eliminate you and all your friends from the face of the earth thirsting for a gutsy country to terrorize try france or maybe china i am ordering the immediate severing of diplomatic relations with france germany and russia thanks for all your help comrades we are retiring from nato as well bonne chance mezamies i have instructed the mayor of new york city to begin towing the many un diplomatic vehicles located in manhattan with more than two unpaid parking tickets to sites where those vehicles will be stripped shredded and crushed i dont care about whatever treaty pertains to this you creeps have tens of thousands of unpaid tickets pay those tickets tomorrow or watch your precious benzes beamers and limos be turned over to some of the finest chop shops in the world i love new york a special note to our neighbors canada is on list 2 since we are likely to be seeing a lot more of each other you folks might want to try not pissing us off for a change mexico is also on list 2 its president and his entire corrupt government really need an attitude adjustment i will have a couple extra thousand tanks and infantry divisions sitting around guess where i am going to put em yep border security oh by the way the united states is abrogating the nafta treaty starting now we are tired of the one way highway immediately well be drilling for oil in alaska which will take care of this countrys oil needs for decades to come if youre an environmentalist who opposes this decision i refer you to list 2 above pick a country and move there it is time for america to focus on its own welfare and its own citizens some will accuse us of isolationism i answer them by saying darn tootin nearly a century of trying to help folks live a decent life around the world has only earned us the undying enmity of just about everyone on the planet it is time to eliminate hunger in america it is time to eliminate homelessness in america to the nations on list 1 a final thought thank you guys we owe you and we wont forget to the nations on list 2 a final thought you might want to learn to speak arabic god bless america thank you and good night

7001185 hundreds of thousands of bacteria on hot spots like a printer button and the button for the first floor in the elevator touched by hundreds of fingers each day even though none of the bacteria gerba found was life threatening they could lead to more colds and flu
7001186 among the bacteria was coli form intestinal bacteria generally found in human waste on the restroom handles and faucets in the kitchen sink and sponge and even in the candy basket
7001187 sneezes and coughs produce particles that once evaporated will turn into a dried residue called droplet nuclei this residue which can last in the air for hours may then transfer infection through the respiratory tract
7001188 local adaptation of the imci guidelines with appropriate training andsupervision could allow safe and effective management of severepneumonia especially if compliance with referral is difficult becauseof geographic financial or cultural barriers
7001189 preventing infection in mri best practices for infection control in and around mri suites
7001190 any patient lying on an imaging table could be a carrier capable of contaminating surfaces in the radiology suite
7001191 mrsa and other pathogens can live on and in common mri table pads and positioners for periods as long as several months
7001192 at many mri centers there exists a false belief that merely placing a clean sheet over contaminated table pads without actually cleaning them between patients will somehow prevent the spread of infectious agents what is most concerning is that very few mri centers regularly clean their pads even once a day much less between patients
7001193 additionally almost all pad sets i have seen in use that are over a few years old are torn or frayed and should have been discarded long ago it is disgusting to see the terrible conditions of some of the pads that patients come in close contact with in these mri centers old torn and frayed pads are impossible to properly clean and are a breeding ground for bacteria
7001194 the best way i have found for patients to protect themselves is to ask to see the centers written infection control policies before their scans and visit the center if there are no written policies i can assure you that infection control has a low priority at that mri center and i would look for another mri center where infection control was taken seriously

7001196 right now theres not much you can do about the vector so it is all a matter of management
7001197 the wheat curl mite is found on volunteer wheat and many different grasses and is blown in the air by winds
7001198 very rarely did you find triticum without wheat streak mosaic
7001199 i really need to survey everywhere i can this year
7001200 in calculating the counties with wheat acreage infected in the northern panhandle early diagnosis could save as much as 9 million for producers by eliminating wasted irrigations
7001201 we werent testing for triticum at that time so it is also a factor to be investigated
7001202 we have the potential to save producers billions of dollars in wasted irrigation and fertilizer costs
7001203 the main time people irrigate in this area is in the late spring and summer during grain fill and heading
7001204 we want to catch it before then if not in the fall
7001205 dre veterinary began distributing the scale aire in response to increased demand for veterinary dental equipment

7001207 this collaboration is an important step in building the infrastructure necessary to enable the use of aposense in our upcoming clinical trials and ultimately commercialization in the u s
7001208 we are excited to partner with iba a world leader in the production of radio isotopes for imaging and therapeutics and about our shared vision of the potential role that aposense can play in helping to improve patient care in multiple disease areas
7001209 this agreement is an important milestone in the expansion of our leading position in the field of radiopharmaceutical products after the announcement in may with wilex ag this is the second agreement for a novel agent in the field of pet radiopharmaceuticals and it confirms our strategy of offering technology materials and services to medical imaging centers from a single source we very much look forward to our enhanced cooperation
7001210 would allow providers to withhold critical health care information without telling their patients
7001211 muddies the line between abortion and contraception and consider it an opening for health care providers to more often refuse to prescribe birth control and other forms of contraception and limit womens healthcare options
7001212 any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
7001213 by financially punishing noncompliant states with the loss of federal funding the regulation would intrude on the authority of states to enact and enforce laws that ensure womens access to birth control
7001214 giant step down a road that will potentially leave women with a major loss of access to contraceptive methods
7001215 still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
7001216 there is an organized effort to force health care professionals to do things that violate their conscience
7001217 daily fodder in the debate over which candidate would do a better job as president
7001218 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
7001219 could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
7001220 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
7001221 when you probe when you ask people whats bothering you about the economy right now in economic downturns problems paying for health care and health insurance really loom large
7001222 after peoples fixations paying for gas prices problems paying for health care are right at the top with job issues
7001223 idea of a health care market or nonmarket entirely run by the government
7001224 liberals support single payer aka medicare for all because it would eliminate the profit motive which by their lights is the reason americans are uninsured
7001225 takes a more moderate campaign line though we suppose just about everything is moderate compared to a total government takeover
7001226 obamas health care plan includes a taxpayer funded insurance program much like medicare but open to everyone
7001227 displace current private coverage and switch people to the default government option
7001228 with good reason critics often call this a back door route to a centrally planned health care bureaucracy
7001229 for all his lawyerly qualifications mr obama has essentially admitted that his proposal is really the front door
7001230 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
7001231 also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
7001232 it has all these painful consequences and makes it difficult to move it results in a severe loss of quality of life for those who are affected by it
7001233 given the lack of knowledge about oa i think any method that is noninvasive and relatively easy to apply will be quite valuable not only do you address diagnosis but you address how we can understand oas mechanism
7001234 there are drugs on the market for oa treatment but no one really knows how effective they are after having done the research we got a lot of calls from pharmaceutical companies wanting to show that their drugs work
7001235 i really hope it will develop into the gold standard technique
7001236 im pretty confident in saying that its one of the better methods out there for testing cartilage health
7001237 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7001238 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7001239 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7001240 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7001241 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7001242 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7001243 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7001244 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7001245 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7001246 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7001247 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7001248 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7001249 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7001250 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7001251 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7001252 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7001253 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7001254 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

7001262 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7001263 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7001264 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7001265 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7001266 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7001267 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7001268 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7001269 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7001270 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7001271 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7001272 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7001273 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7001274 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7001275 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7001276 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7001277 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7001278 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7001279 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7001280 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7001281 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7001282 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7001283 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7001284 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7001285 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7001286 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7001287 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7001288 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

7001291 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7001292 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nation wide rabies vaccination programmes since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention

7001332 its pretty difficult to remember what you ate a few months ago and even harder to get samples of it
7001333 that day against lyons i had a height advantage of over five inches its the same difference as someone 5 7
7001334 if it comes down to that then kerry have the obvious advantage
7001335 i think its an amazing reflection of their talent that they can afford to play kieran donaghy and
7001336 if walsh and donaghy were in any other county one of them if not both of them would be playing midfield but kerry have just got used to playing the right ball into them theyve worked on it they have made it their game plan to work the ball into certain areas before they deliver the last pass its structured and no one understands the dimensions better now than this kerry team
7001337 he wore something like no 27 in this years munster final in james masters were out in the half forward line clearly to provide an accurate service to their big man it worked well for them but the ball doesnt always have snow on it
7001338 if its played straight down on top of them its a backs ball 10 yards in front or to the side and these guys have all the advantage
7001339 he has the second best pair of hands in gaelic football that i have seen kerry and basketball colleague has the best
7001340 but for overall package i dont think there is a better one than donaghy hes the most unselfish player i think ive ever seen with cussen there are a couple of questions he hasnt been marked by a big full back yet and until he is we wont really know
7001341 he has better hands than gooch and that says something and hes stronger than he was too infinitely stronger you can see that cussen is like a big hes just impossible to get around
7001342 but the trend of the big full forward is not something thats likely to catch on because its just not possible for most counties
7001343 donaghy and cussen are great footballers on top of everything else cussens point off his left against kildare illustrated that steven mcdonnell getting on to the end of those diagonal balls from mckeever mcentee and mcgeeney but its not the perfect fit for every team
7001344 maybe wed be taking something from midfield but ronan is light there hes in the region of 13 and a half stone darragh s for instance must be close to 15 stone
7001345 kerry are just better at working the ball into those supply areas
7001346 olha oct vio quero agradecer te demonstrar a minha gratid o porque eu sei que vou ser campe o nacional j ningu m me tira o t tulo e gra as a jogadores como tu que s o capazes de nas horas dif ceis ir buscar tudo o que t m l dentro que eu vou ser campe o o futebol assim geralmente os artistas nestas alturas falham sempre e tu conseguiste agarrar naquilo tudo e a equipa correspondeu
7001347 com o oliveira a treinador a minha continuidade ficava de todo em todo afastada eu jamais faria parte de um grupo de trabalho que integrasse o ant nio oliveira as rela es entre n s nunca foram boas em termos de postura na vida somos incompat veis vivemos em dois mundos completamente distintos como do dia para a noite a maneira como o oliveira estava no futebol era absolutamente contr ria maneira como eu penso que se deve estar no futebol sou um defensor ac rrimo do rigor da disciplina do cumprimento o ant nio oliveira representa precisamente o oposto de tudo isso nos treinos na observ ncia dos hor rios etc foi um grande jogador de futebol um virtuoso mas em termos de cultura profissional deixa muito a desejar
7001348 tudo assim disposto e arranjado no dia do jogo soou o alarme o juary tinha desaparecido
7001349 ent o tu no dia da final sabendo que h aqui jornalistas vens meter te na sauna tem vergonha
7001350 n o est s enganado n o fiz queixa a ningu m agora se o artur jorge precisar de ti logo noite e se tu n o corresponderes n s que vamos ter uma conversa n s os dois eu e tu o que aconteceu fica entre n s agora o exame logo se o artur jorge precisar de ti veremos
7001351 temos 45 minutos para a gl ria portanto desinibam se joguem divirtam se fa am aquilo que fazem todos os dias e seremos campe es da europa
7001352 nestas alturas quando as equipas ganham nunca faltam amigos conselheiros colaboradores todos querem aparecer
7001353 tu n o prestas tu foste capaz de perseguir uma pessoa que te ajudou da maneira que sabemos portanto est calado n o digas nada olha para mim olhos nos olhos tu nem profiss o tens a tua profiss o ser filho de quem s o teu pai sim um senhor um gentleman
7001354 pela maneira como o artur jorge agarrou na equipa pela introdu o de novas variantes de treino pela forma como soube dar continuidade ao que vinha de tr s come ou a perceber se que um novo fc porto estava a nascer o artur jorge como treinador principal eu como adjunto com a miss o entre outras de observar jogadores e treinar os guarda redes acabou se com certos h bitos instalados o que n o agradou a todos claro h sempre alguns que s o al rgicos a mudan as que se sentem incomodados e por isso houve quem quisesse contestar os meus n veis de exig ncia ao contr rio do que muitos diziam nunca fui a casa dos jogadores como uma sentinela fazer a ronda verificar se j estavam a dormir claro que os jogadores t m de respeitar as horas do recolher n o que houvesse horas espec ficas para estar a dormir mas havia que evitar as horas impr prias nos est gios ia a todos os quartos s onze da noite para entregar o programa do dia seguinte ver se n o faltava nada aos jogadores e desejar lhes boa noite sempre foi um h bito meu acompanhar a equipa m dica na visita aos quartos na hora do recolher algo de que sempre gostei quando tamb m eu era jogador s o pormenores como estes que criam uma rela o de proximidade com o grupo o que serviu tamb m para compensar um certo afastamento do artur jorge em rela o aos jogadores nesta fase em que fomos campe es da europa o fc porto naturalmente era o clube com mais jogadores na selec o nacional e eu passei a fazer tamb m o acompanhamento da selec o para que os jogadores se sentissem apoiados pelo clube muitas vezes pernoit vamos em lisboa fic vamos todos no mesmo hotel eu ia com eles para gerir e evitar sobretudo a exposi o medi tica mais uma vez se especulou foi afirmado que eu acompanhava a selec o nacional apenas para controlar os jogadores do fc porto impedi los de cair em situa es como aquela que aconteceu neste ltimo mundial na alemanha quando saiu a not cia da noitada do sim o sabrosa e do boa morte digam o que disserem a verdade que estas coisas n o podem acontecer s o inadmiss veis preciso apostar na preven o cabe na cabe a de algu m por exemplo marcar o est gio da selec o nacional para o mundial da coreia de 2002 em macau famosa pelo jogo e pela prostitui o quando se programa todo um trabalho de prepara o para um evento como o mundial e n o se tem em conta esses aspectos a ocasi o faz o ladr o s pode dar naquilo que deu uma presta o deplor vel h quem diga at que a selec o nacional lan ou a moda em macau de ir para a praia s 4 da manh ora aconteceu o que aconteceu e nunca foram abertos inqu ritos a federa o n o faz absolutamente nada
7001355 eram coisas como estas que faziam com que o artur jorge se afastasse um bocado do grupo se isolasse por exemplo nos jogos fora quando a equipa n o ganhava ou o resultado era menos bom e constava que os s cios estavam no est dio espera da equipa o artur jorge nem sequer ia s antas no regresso sa a pr ximo da casa dele que ficava perto da ponte da arr bida ou seja punha se a bom recato os jogadores como bvio n o gostavam disso dava a ideia de que o treinador estava a fugir s suas responsabilidades e um l der um l der um chefe um chefe para o bem e para o mal e enfrenta a realidade mesmo que seja m ora isto fragilizou um bocado o artur jorge causou alguma eros o na rela o dele com os jogadores a verdade que o artur jorge nunca conseguiu desenvolver com os jogadores uma rela o de proximidade h uma m goa que o artur tem na vida e que esta na final da ta a dos campe es os jogadores n o tiveram para com ele a manifesta o que se v na maior parte das equipas ou seja atirar o treinador ao ar n o quer dizer que n o tivessem grande respeito por ele talvez gostassem que houvesse maior proximidade da parte do treinador n o digo que fosse como alguns chegaram a afirmar porque o artur se considerava um intelectual da bola n o aquela era a sua maneira de ser que se acentuou julgo depois da ida dele para fran a depois de ter sido rotulado de rei isso talvez o tenha transformado um pouco de qualquer forma o artur nunca foi dado a grandes manifesta es n o uma pessoa muito emotiva tentou sempre cultivar uma imagem diferente quer enquanto jogador quer enquanto treinador
7001356 na casa do bairro alto o artur jorge sugeriu me como sabia que havia problemas entre mim e os oliveiras que eu concedesse uma entrevista a dizer bem deles e tudo seria muito mais f cil
7001357 tu deves estar a brincar comigo tu est s de certeza a brincar comigo eu n o te admito uma coisa destas
7001358 mas qual mada l qual carapu a o que que o mada l tem a ver com isto artur n o s tu o seleccionador n o foste tu quem se armou em rei n o foste tu que disseste que quem escolhia as pessoas que iriam trabalhar contigo eras tu e apenas tu n o disseste que eras tu quem mandava e agora come as j a fragilizar te logo partida tu assim n o tens futuro nenhum e aquilo que tu queres entregar a minha cabe a numa bandeja aos meus inimigos aos gajos que querem dar cabo de mim e tu fizeste me passar por isto tudo disponibilizei me para trabalhar contigo e agora passo pela vergonha de andar nas bocas do mundo como se tivesse sido eu a oferecer me para o lugar isto inadmiss vel eu n o te admito isto vens tu falar do mada l mas qual mada l quando regressou da su a o mada l disse ao dr roquette que aceitava tudo aquilo que tu decidisses por que que est s tu agora a refugiar te no mada l
7001359 disse sim disse ao dr roquette e este contou me a mim

7001414 why should the president consult the people with respect to the parameters of power
7001415 the government has not given its consent to the moa
7001416 so it is not a contract not an agreement yet
7001417 what is the value of this document it is not signed there is no basis there is nothing anymore to prohibit
7001418 with the absence of the signature of the people who are authorized to sign it is not yet a perfected document
7001419 on the basis of that document you referring to chief negotiator rodolfo garcia do not carry the full power of the president your authority is only based on the document
7001420 in the last two plebiscites the subject matter was armm autonomous region in muslim mindanao right and armm the organic act of armm does not provide that the armm will have its internal police security force its own courts its own comelec correct
7001421 so can that 1989 and 2001 plebiscite be considered consultation will that consultation apply now in the bje bangsamoro juridical entity concept
7001422 the milf did not want to be bound by our constitution
7001423 it is a consensus that the moa will be signed but the government has not yet given anyone the authority to sign the moa since wala pang there is no go signal from the government to sign the moa even if it has been signed it will not be binding

7001426 tiada suatu haripun amalan kebaikan padanya mempunyai kelebihan melainkan pada hari hari ini iaitu sepuluh hari zulhijjah

7001433 our lives improve only when we take chances and the first and most difficult risk we can take is to be honest with ourselves
7001434 if youre never scared or embarrassed or hurt it means you never take any chances
7001435 risk risk anything care no more for the opinions of others for those voices do the hardest thing on earth for you act for yourself face the truth
7001436 take risks if you win you will be happy if you lose you will be wise
7001437 as we risk ourselves we grow each new experience is a risk
7001438 we have all got both light and dark inside us what matters is the power we choose to act on thats who we really are
7001439 she has a choice she can either accept a life of misery or she can struggle against it and she chooses to struggle she fails in the end but theres something beautiful and even heroic in her rebellion
7001440 i have to believe i got some kind of say over our lives
7001441 what makes a man a man its the choices he makes not how he starts things but how he finishes them
7001442 its what you do right now that makes a difference
7001443 all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us
7001444 one comes to a decision based on what one wants not based on what one doesnt want got it
7001445 contohnya kita gagal dalam suatu exam atau kita extend satu semester atau dua semester atau apa apa je lah rasa sedih tak tambah lagi kita tengok kawan kawan kita dah graduation dan dapat skrol sedih ke tak
7001446 the team leader told me what happened to her was too much breathing
7001447 shes okay shes clearly conscious and its nothing serious shes in bed lying down shes all right
7001448 oh he he wasnt hurt as badly as we were led to believe
7001449 this will really help us under the cap if we say
7001450 we really hope he doesnt sign anywhere else because that would hurt us
7001451 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
7001452 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
7001453 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
7001454 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
7001455 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
7001456 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
7001457 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
7001458 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
7001459 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
7001460 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
7001461 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
7001462 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
7001463 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
7001464 how can this planner be detail oriented when she even misspells the word detail
7001465 the way you do anything is the way you do everything
7001466 one of the key reasons for the success of the chevrolet cobalt and pontiac g5 is the lordstown workforce and the strong partnerships with the uaw and local and state officials
7001467 based on the quality of work and these strong partnerships we are pleased to announce our plans to invest another 500 million in the chevy cruze product program in the u s including more than 350 million in lordstown
7001468 the cruze will build on the already successful chevrolet cobalt cobalt xfe and cobalt ss all of which are nearly sold out in dealer showrooms
7001469 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
7001470 the chevrolet cruze was designed and engineered by our global teams in europe and asia pacific and will be manufactured in those regions in addition to the assembly plant here in lordstown ohio
7001471 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
7001472 the tm506 not only signifies sony ericssons expanding u s portfolio of handsets but more importantly that we have forged a strong and promising relationship with t mobile
7001473 with the launch of the tm506 with t mobile sony ericsson is positioned to offer more choice of mobile handsets for a broader range of u s consumer segments at a variety of price points
7001474 t mobile continues its 3g network deployment across the country and were pleased to leverage sony ericssons 3g handset experience to help deliver the benefits of our next generation network to our customers
7001475 the sony ericsson tm506 is a compelling feature rich phone with a vibrant display that our customers will enjoy using to connect with the important people in their lives
7001476 gives a new perspective on the english civil war through the eyes of angelica fanshawe riseborough who is drawn to the anti monarchist cause at a time when england executed its king in favor of an alternative form of government
7001477 considering the british traditions of free speech and the individual and the british suspicion of organized crowds we would want to avoid the leni riefenstahl connotations which were there in beijing and the ceremony was too long
7001478 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
7001479 we didnt know much about turkey until i got a job offer there
7001480 the first thing we did was we google earthed it to find out where exactly it is in the world
7001481 i dont really want to work in a public school i want to work in a university with the refugee population
7001482 to get a job in a college here you have to have experience i have to travel for my career anyway and ryan wants to write
7001483 itll be fun to come home and kind of challenge people
7001484 when you tell them that youre going to a different country or especially a muslim country they say all kinds of ridiculous things that theyve heard or theyve read itll be fun to actually say we were there and its not quite the same
7001485 i think theyre just worried because they dont know a lot about turkey
7001486 and any kind of research they dont want to dig too much because theyre scared of what they might find
7001487 he was saying and he was being frightfully ironical that he couldnt impose a congestion charge on the motorists of beijing with all the draconian ruthlessness of the mayor of london

7001491 the common wishes of people all over the world inspired by the olympic ideals to strive for a bright future of mankind in spite of the differences in colors languages and races we share the charm and joy of the olympic games and together we seek for the ideal of mankind for peace
7001492 theyve been great the fans travel very well everywhere playing at fenway in every home game in that atmosphere is unbelievable i think its different than anywhere else in the big leagues just with the following boston has and deservedly so
7001493 its a history rich organization i dont think there are too many guys who play baseball who wouldnt want to experience it at some point
7001494 no slight to pittsburgh it just didnt work out now you come in here and realize youre playing for much more than yourself much more than just your statistics when youre 20 games under its very tough
7001495 what kind of helped me with the whole manny thing was that if i was an in house candidate and i had been here a little bit and played with him or seen him and all this stuff i think there would have been a bit more pressure to try to live up to that
7001496 but we crossed paths in the air so everything is just what i hear its a lot easier not knowing anything about him
7001497 and i really think he believed it hes been a good player hes run the bases hes played the outfield i think hes genuinely excited about being in a situation where every game is like i dont want to say chaos but where every game means so much he has been longing for that
7001498 in that society the middle aged people are mostly gone
7001499 grandmothers sometimes raise children from three or four of their own children different families
7001500 children dont only lose their parents they lose all the other people who would be an influence when theyre growing up schoolteachers leaders everyone in society that helps you grow up
7001501 poor health care poor water supply poor nutrition all related to poverty some people look at the enormity of those problems and say they need big answers
7001502 but my honest sense is the answer will come by everybody contributing small amounts 5 10 20 i think the world is recognizing that it should happen and there is enough will in the world to do it
7001503 there will come a time when we cant sit back and wait for the united nations and bill gates its going to be individuals who solve it
7001504 youre basically examining patients in a clinic under a thatched roof and mud walls built by villagers
7001505 so theres this grandmother five kids and their spouses all gone looking after her grandchildren and ones already infected with the aids virus
7001506 that really struck me theres a whole middle generation thats gone from aids the needs are great
7001507 things we take for granted here you cant take for granted there
7001508 if every person in africa was kept under a net africa would be able to get malaria under control
7001509 there are people who are hungry and poor and need support but they also want to be guided to be accepted and to know other people care for them
7001510 thats the most valuable thing you can do for them
7001511 they learn from us and we learn from them you see how people who have so little are so deeply grateful and truly happy
7001512 theres such extravagance here and yet people are so quick to complain

7001548 they are effectively the puppeteer of one of these photo reel digital actors
7001549 this combination of technologies is just at the brink where in the next couple of years well see it really work and were all going to be pretty amazed by it
7001550 you go through the entire script with digital props and car crashes with digital robots says tracy mcsheery an engineer with phasespace a company that specialises in motion capture systems
7001551 you can show it to test audiences and vet the entire production to make sure that its exactly what you want before you spend the million of dollars and months of time and then find out it didnt quite have the look or feel that you were hoping for
7001552 theres totally the possibility that you can create something that never existed that becomes a popular star of motion picture
7001553 this has been done with mickey mouse to begin with and bugs bunny and all of these animated characters the only change now is that theyll be able to look like real people instead of cartoon characters
7001554 the best most powerful and most easily programmed computer in the world is the one between our ears
7001555 for a while yet the cheapest way to make movies will be for real people to follow the directions of the director sure cgi effects are cool and will advance a lot as the years pass but actors will be with us a long while yet

7001567 y2k problem will make some confuse or panic all over the world but actually no big problems have not occurred at all only few small problems happened then this prediction has not been hit whoops
7001568 the massive cleanup effort for the olympic games has come at a cost to the local economy of some nearby industrial cities whose factories have been forced to close down temporarily
7001569 we had our chances in the game and we just couldnt find a way to take one of them overall i cant complain about the way we played as a team at this tournament the spirit was high and we were together all the time gold would have been better but at least we have a silver to go home with
7001570 overall we can be proud of what we did here in beijing there was some disrespect shown to us before the final started and no one was giving us a chance in the end i think we did ourselves proud with our efforts here in beijing were disappointed to lose the final but when we look back on this later well all be proud
7001571 not many people actually expected us to get here so we proved them wrong
7001572 we are a great family and families dont break apart when things go wrong we can be well proud
7001573 we eat together we drink together we play together and we share everything as one group we have good times and bad times and weve been together for so long i am a happy man today we are not keen on losing but a lot of very good teams went home with nothing we have silver

7001575 i feel that we are champions just by being here

7001582 in terry childs mind obviously he thinks the network is his but its not its the taxpayers

7001602 according to the classical model there ought not to be these differences
7001603 according to this both brown dwarfs and stars ought to emerge from interstellar clouds of gas which become concentrated because of the attraction of their mass but if this was the case these celestial bodies should behave in similar ways
7001604 for this we analysed the masses of newly born stars
7001605 this revealed a jump in the distribution of mass which makes the division in the stellar population apparent

7001642 leeds were pretty hot we couldnt handle them which was disappointing
7001643 at 12 10 we had got back in the game but we gifted them a try and then let in a couple of soft ones but were not down and out it was a great lesson for us on how intense we have to be at this time of the year

7001647 the south west pipeline will extend from bunbury to albany via bridgetown and manjimup at a cost of around 225 million with construction expected to begin in the first term of a liberal government
7001648 this could allow renewable energy projects to be installed without the need for expensive transmission system upgrades to support additional capacity
7001649 this would be particularly relevant for wind projects that have high prospects in the region
7001650 as flawed today as when he announced it in 2000 and 2005
7001651 why cant mr barnett say what the operating subsidy will cost it is reckless and irresponsible to pursue this project without telling taxpayers what they will be up for
7001652 mr barnett has also failed to take into account the cost of acquiring easements for the pipelines construction
7001653 and he has failed to factor in the cost of expanding the existing dampier to bunbury gas pipeline which is already at capacity
7001654 it shows mr barnett hasnt learned the lessons from his kimberley canal pipedream
7001655 this is not an energy policy it is another of mr barnetts vanity projects
7001656 this is the man who was so unconcerned about the states energy security that he sold off the dampier to bunbury gas pipeline and alintagas
7001657 they the judges should hang their heads in shame theres no doubt i lost the fight by miles but not scoring a point im getting drug tested here the judges should be getting drug tested but were in china so what do you expect

7001676 but the huge amount of strategic planning and the leap of faith are delivering a first rate calibre of cast
7001677 there is a real buzz about the project in manhattan as quentin was a much loved and notorious figure everyone has an anecdote to tell about him and weve been touched by the number of friends and admirers of his some of whom he never knew who have wanted to help with the project in myriad different ways
7001678 we are delighted to be making another film about quentin crisp given the naked civil servant was such a landmark film for itv its a real thrill and honour to be bringing an actor of john hurts stature back to the channel to reprise such an iconic role
7001679 people have given us a message the issues have been overwhelmingly about the cost of living about food prices petrol prices utility bills people understand the global situation but they look to the government to sort things out but the message to the entire government is that people want to know that we understand that they really are feeling the pinch the entire government has to reflect on that and bring forward policies that take on their concerns

7001721 het maakt mij niet uit of het eind september of pas oktober wordt dat het restaurant open gaat als het op dat moment maar helemaal naar mijn zin is ik ben pas tevreden op het moment dat ik een toefje vers kruid op het laatste toetje van mijn eerste klanten leg
7001722 deze lampen komen hier de originelen zijn meer dan honderd jaar oud en hangen in een moskee in egypte ik heb er een foto van gemaakt en ben daarmee langs verschillende werkplaatsen gegaan om te vragen of iemand ze voor mij wilde namaken dat is gelukt
7001723 the information i have is we have not accepted any to this point
7001724 we have to look at our class size and whether we have room or not
7001725 because it is such a close call there we are waiting until after school begins to confirm our attendance as to whether any will be admitted
7001726 according to the principal at montcalm there has been several requests
7001727 we can apply to the health care authority to do the angioplasty and stints without the open heart surgery back up
7001728 what this does for the people in our community is that it will allow them if they present at brmc to receive the treatment they need to minimize the extent of a heart attack
7001729 basically this is an issue of access to health care patients we serve in my opinion have the right to receive the same type of treatment they would in a metropolitan area
7001730 this has been a united effort of friends who love to come together share their talents and show their love for the city
7001731 there has never been any money exchanged for these concerts
7001732 everyone who comes here does so because they love chicory square and they love the downtown
7001733 you mean so much to downtown bluefield and the whole area
7001734 have benefited from the wonderful talent you have brought here week after week
7001735 we do appreciate everything the telegraph does for the downtown
7001736 ill remember all of these friends but all good things eventually come to an end
7001737 i would like to be able to spend a little time with my children in the summers but during the concert series i felt it was important for me to stay here to ensure that the performers had everything they needed for their shows
7001738 it was all of the performers and all of the people who attended the performances that made it special
7001739 the independent witnesses we have do not support that something inappropriate was said
7001740 you never really expect it to be someone that youre close to but after a few minutes when it started to sink in i was very proud
7001741 its always difficult when a friend dies however theres a time for mourning and theres a time for standing up and carrying on
7001742 he told me maccready im going to save this beer for when you get back
7001743 he was the kind of guy that i could look to for reassurance or confirmation he was proud to go and he knew what he was doing
7001744 like a child awaiting christmas he even initiated a countdown as he got closer to going overseas
7001745 he insisted many times are we not here for the kids is that not why we are here dustin was there for the kids and hoped one day his work would make a difference
7001746 he was a sweet good boy very outgoing caring and everybody loved him
7001747 he brought a frog and a gecko home and his dad told him hed have to feed them or let them go
7001748 if students feel the need to talk to someone well have extra counselors on staff monday and the school will have a representative at the funeral
7001749 you should have seen all the people and kids that came by thursday
7001750 the community has poured out their heart and we appreciate it
7001751 she said she was so sorry she couldnt stop when he went in front of her we feel sorry for her she must be traumatized too
7001752 it is highly unlikely joey will be involved with us before fa hearing
7001753 what we have got to do with joey is just try to assess where his fitness is
7001754 it is all right to come in and play a game but how will he react after it
7001755 if he was fit enough and looked strong enough and put himself up for selection that way i would play him before then
7001756 but at the moment it is looking unlikely just because of the work he has missed
7001757 and he said no that i had to stay to talk with their fbi representative
7001758 when the officer told me i couldnt leave i packed up my camera gear sat in my car and waited for cpl tom robison

7001776 it is also to demand our right to self determination through a referendum

7001778 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7001779 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7001780 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
7001781 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
7001782 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7001783 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7001784 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7001785 we have always said that the roles missions and size of the american forces here the coalition forces was based on the conditions on the ground and what is needed
7001786 will review the security situation in the country and if necessary will ask the american side for certain forces for training or supporting the iraqi security forces
7001787 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7001788 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7001789 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7001790 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7001791 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7001792 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7001793 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7001794 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
7001795 im in favor of another agreement whatever it takes to stop the conflict but you know it just cannot have as a tradeoff the criminals going scott free
7001796 he felt really lonely and wanted to be with his mother and family

7001880 there are so many banners buntings and posters around the area where did pkr get the money from it seems they have spent millions rm here it seems they have signed some deal with their foreign funders

7001889 when he got up thursday it was bothering him again
7001890 he had to get another shot in it once he got the shot we couldnt play him in the game
7001891 thats the best theyve looked in preseason this was a big opportunity for chris and he did a good job
7001892 the heat that were getting is that were not getting enough pass rush
7001893 its kind of frustrating because we get all these quarterback hits and pressures but it doesnt really matter unless we get a sack
7001894 but its still preseason im not going to panic its something we do have to fix but we have coaches who watch film and we have no choice but to fix it
7001895 i wish i could have gotten a catch but other than that i felt fine and was happy to be back with my teammates
7001896 hes one of the best backs in the league im not going to take anything away from him but i think it was more the scheme
7001897 i know on one play i was up field trying to get the quarterback and it was a draw so i made the gap wide
7001898 but i think we just have to be more disciplined about the run
7001899 as a sportsman eating well is really important thats why i buy fresh produce at the local market

7001905 faith is a way of saying yes i pre accept the terms of the universe and i embrace in advance what i am presently incapable of understanding theres a reason we refer to leaps of faith because the decision to consent to any notion of divinity is a mighty jump from the rational over to the unknowable and i dont care how diligently scholars of every religion will try to sit you down with their stacks of books and prove to you through scripture that their faith is indeed rational it isnt if faith were rational it wouldnt be by definition faith faith is belief in what you cannot see or prove or touch faith is walking face first and full speed into the dark if we truly knew all the answers in advance as to the meaning of life and the nature of god and the destiny of our souls our belief would not be a leap of faith and it would not be a courageous act of humanity it would just be a prudent insurance policy im not interested in the insurance industry im tired of being a skeptic im irritated by spiritual prudence and i feel bored and parched by empirical debate i dont want to hear it anymore i couldnt care less about evidence and proof and assurances i just want god i want god inside me i want god to play in my bloodstream the way sunlight amuses itself on water
7001906 education alerts is a way without being overly intrusive to interact with students who may not remember us very well and it gets them back into thinking about our school
7001907 education alerts identifies and contacts prospects that previously showed interest and rekindles interest without overextending our marketing department as a result weve captured a much larger percentage of students who we originally deemed as losses
7001908 while most career school owners presidents and marketing directors understand the value of recycling their inactive student leads few have the internal resources to mine the gold in their prospect databases
7001909 as the cost to keep the student lead pipeline full with quality student leads continues to increase across all media broadcast print and its critical for schools to recycle their inactive student leads thats where education alerts fits into a schools lead generation strategy

7001925 it was disappointing but put yourself in my shoes i was 28 in the prime of my career had had surgery the previous season and came back to play in the playoffs in the best shape of my life
7001926 my left surgically repaired leg was stronger than my right but they told me i had degenerative arthritis
7001927 life is adversity and how you handle it thats why im excited about coming back here with people i know in a great organization with a team that has some talent
7001928 i told coach maurice cheeks if he needs me to sell popcorn ill do that too
7001929 that i am able to add a coach with the experience and credentials of jeff ruland to my staff is exciting

7001934 when the opportunity presents itself im just trying to take the bull by the horns
7001935 hes not on the field its hard i mean its tough for him right now hes not on the field until we get him back on the field were not going to know
7001936 he wasnt quite there yet thats just being honest hes working at it but hes not quite there yet
7001937 just with the naked eye it looked like he played well
7001938 the other guys had been doing some stuff against kaczur and i just fed off what they had been doing
7001939 the only thing i can control is what i can control and go out and play my butt off
7001940 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
7001941 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here
7001942 and he was like dont worry mon we got this one
7001943 i would like that i went to the futures game eastern league all star olympics
7001944 you come out here knowing you have to win every game thats what youre trying to do up in the big leagues win every game
7001945 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
7001946 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7001947 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7001948 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7001949 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7001950 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7001951 all in all i thought it was a good game in spots
7001952 i was glad to see we tackled better and caught the ball better than we did last week and then i thought our special teams played better it was good to see the young returners do some things i think theyre both explosive players
7001953 i just wanted to show to the fans everybody thats watching coaches everybody that im capable of getting the job done
7001954 im young im a rookie and things like that but i definitely feel i play very confident i just know what im capable of doing
7001955 you see three fat boys and a fast dude in front of you blocking
7001956 its the new england patriots theyre a very confident team and a great team also
7001957 dang he scored one before i did i knew the next time i got out there i was going to have to take it the distance because he took it the distance
7001958 i felt the punter kind of outkicked his coverage and i just did a great job of catching the ball and making two moves to the side and hitting the seam and getting right up the middle from there it was nothing but daylight
7001959 it wasnt the worst one weve seen it wasnt the simplest one weve seen
7001960 we had some big hits throughout the lineup tonight and were able to get runs across
7001961 they swept us there coming off a loss we really wanted to come out today and obviously win a game
7001962 hopefully we can continue this for the rest of the year
7001963 were going to have to if we are going to overcome the mets were going to have to have games like this throughout the rest of the year
7001964 i dont want to come out of this game he said i had to give him the benefit of the doubt its only fair to him for what hes brought to the team
7001965 once we saw their best player go down we let up
7001966 they cut the lead to nine or something like that
7001967 melo was trying to protect howard and we were trying to protect melo
7001968 it got a little chippy out there nothing personal im going to get an ice bath
7001969 weve got to play better than what we did tonight
7001970 ive watched it a couple of different times earlier in the year it helps to an extent
7001971 they did it last week in that four game series out there especially on utley and howard
7001972 if i split them they might not be so eager to bring them in on us
7001973 its a good test of who we are were going to see you have to beat good clubs we have to try to win some games to overtake the mets
7001974 this hasnt been a case of alex and shaun not performing well
7001975 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season

7002011 global capitalism as we know it today would appear to be inherently incompatible with the pursuit of either ecological sustainability or social justice
7002012 the idea that we can sustain the kind of growth we have seen since 1950 in key areas of economic activity knowing what we already know about the state of the planet is simply fantastical
7002013 over reliance on the assumed power of evidence and on the rational consideration of long term collective self interest to shift political systems has proved to be something of a mistake

7002031 es muy dif cil pero siempre hay alg n porcentaje no s si del uno por ciento o cual pero hay posibilidades que tenemos que aprovechar lo que hizo argentina sirve para nosotros por la fuerza que dieron los jugadores no habituales aunque uno de los de siempre luis scola veintiocho puntos frente a los norteamericanos en semifinales estuvo fant stico
7002032 vamos a ver si damos la talla es dif cil despu s de la derrota que tuvimos con ellos pero en esa derrota estuvimos muy por debajo de nuestras posibilidades y estados unidos al cien por cien
7002033 estados unidos estaba pensando m s en la final que en argentina es lo que pas en la primera fase contra ellos que el equipo pensaba m s en los cuartos de final pero ste es el ltimo partido
7002034 ellos juegan a un ritmo muy alto y tiene una potencia tremenda eso hace dif cil jugar contra ellos porque dificulta el ataque frenarles la velocidad y el rebote de ataque es dif cil espero que los rbitros piten los pasos con los que cobran ventaja y las faltas pero si no lo hacen no es bice para que nosotros nos paremos
7002035 es muy importante saber que ellos defienden siempre y nosotros no podemos estar descansando en ataque cuando no tenemos el bal n hay que jugar sin bal n para que el jugador que lo tiene siempre tenga el recurso de poder pasar es un trabajo que hay que hacer siempre
7002036 depende como hagas la zona por ejemplo el argentino juan pedro guti rrez es un jugador complementario en granada pero pon a el cuerpo en la semifinal ante los estadounidenses y no pod an hacer mates
7002037 oberto que es un jugador m s contrastado pon a la mano y quitaba el cuerpo as que entraban a matar hay que poner el cuerpo pero no es f cil es muy importante ponerse
7002038 el momento de hacer el resumen de los juegos ser despu s del partido pero no cabe duda de que el baloncesto espa ol ha vuelto a triunfar en un campeonato internacional al ser algo tan repetido durante tantos a os quiere decir que hay un trabajo fenomenal tanto en la formaci n como en los clubes en la acb y en la federaci n y eso es un motivo de orgullo

7002088 with great grief have i learnt about the death of prominent armenian scientist sergey mergelyan he has made a great contribution to the development of armenian science no doubt that future generation will remember s mergelyan as great scientist prominent coordinator and excellent pedagogue
7002089 it is true that we did use the turlock shelter last winter probably between january and march
7002090 there were about eight different sex offenders not there all at same time there at different times during that period
7002091 if they dont do that theyre in trouble with parole
7002092 we did not contact the chief directly but the sex offenders by law have to register when they move into a new place and we always confirm that theyve done that
7002093 legally they have been notified the chief feels that thats not sufficient it is in actuality they are walking into the police department to register
7002094 we did not sneak people into turlock we didnt bus them down there and we didnt hide them
7002095 we tracked a parolee driving around the stanislaus county fair
7002096 he wasnt in the fair but the agent wondered why he kept driving around outside
7002097 thats what the gps can do and thats what parole does hes now in custody
7002098 we do not harbor them its not a place where they can come and hide but its not a place where we deny them
7002099 a parolee has committed some crime but im not a judge or jury if hes gone through the procedure of doing his time theyre the ones who put them back out on the street not me
7002100 if i had to face it again how would i deal with it
7002101 maybe ignorance is bliss in this case were not there to judge people were there to give a safe place for everybody
7002102 artist of whom the actvity of this year is expected
7002103 apuntes sobre la cultura 1 y 2 he tratado de la cultura colectiva haciendo referencia al magn fico libro de jes s moster n sobre este tema titulado
7002104 its the fourth inning and youre sold out of beer goddamn
7002105 therefore accept one another just as christ also accepted us to the glory of god
7002106 to coordinate with the ship owner the international maritime authorities and the host governments on efforts to secure the safe and speedy release of the crewmembers
7002107 for the safety of the crew we cannot disclose too much but we call on the un and the international community to take urgent steps and stop the worsening security situation in these waters
7002108 we are very concerned with the current situation we have been warning seafarers plying these waters on a regular basis as attacks are escalating
7002109 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
7002110 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same
7002111 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
7002112 angesichts des geringen und sehr unregelm igen durchflusses kann die menge des betroffenen materials nur gering sein
7002113 hopefully we can pull out a win today and give ourselves a chance to win the series and move on to tampa but you have to win youve got to win
7002114 we know theres only so many games left in the season
7002115 every single loss no matter who its against they all hurt you take them all home you feel it a little bit more right now because the seasons winding down we have high expectations of ourselves nobodys harder on ourselves than us
7002116 he can run the bases play the outfield i think hes genuinely excited about being in a situation where every game is chaos and means so much im not talking down the pirates but were in a different situation right now hes excited
7002117 no slight to pittsburgh it just didnt work out you come in here and realize that youre playing for much more than just yourself your statistics you realize that everybody is in the same boat about winning ballgames you dont care how you do it its fun
7002118 if i was an in house candidate where i had been here a little bit and seen him it would have been a lot of pressure to live up to that but we crossed paths in the air
7002119 i kind of asked him when he came over that first day i told him ive got to give you the prerequisite managers speech about not trying too hard and all that knowing that you probably will
7002120 but he told me that first day ill be fine i really think he believed it hes been good hes impressive
7002121 but those who repent have faith and do good may receive salvation your lord alone creates and chooses as he will and others have no part in his choice glorified is god and exalted above any partners they ascribe to him
7002122 give any information you have garnered to a fellow traveler along the way why because the same information would have helped the person who compiled it if it had been given to him and that is why he compiled it and that is why it should be offered to others along the way
7002123 zonder protest lijken de europese landen hun eigen verdragen over mensenrechten niet serieus te nemen
7002124 dat zou het begin van het einde zijn van onze normen
7002125 als rusland hier zomaar mensen oppakt en meeneemt zouden we dat absoluut niet accepteren waarom dan wel voor de vs die dubbele normen moeten we voorkomen
7002126 two persons wearing arab uniforms opened fire at a police station in basra a police patrol followed the attackers and captured them to discover they were two british soldiers
7002127 donald rumsfeld still has an office in the pentagon that he is working out of and has six staff members working for him
7002128 the numbers are so large that it doesnt seem possible that theyre true who in their right mind would send 363 tonnes of cash into a war zone
7002129 one cpa official described an environment awash in 100 bills
7002130 one contractor received a 2m payment in a duffel bag stuffed with shrink wrapped bundles of currency auditors discovered that the key to a vault was kept in an unsecured backpack
7002131 they also found that 774 300 in cash had been stolen from one divisions vault cash payments were made from the back of a pickup truck and cash was stored in unguarded sacks in iraqi ministry offices one official was given 6 75m in cash and was ordered to spend it in one week before the interim iraqi government took control of iraqi funds
7002132 a single disbursement of 500m in security funding labelled merely tbd meaning to be determined
7002133 many of the funds appear to have been lost to corruption and waste thousands of ghost employees were receiving pay cheques from iraqi ministries under the cpas control some of the funds could have enriched both criminals and insurgents fighting the united states
7002134 without assurance the monies were properly used or accounted for
7002135 he now believes that the lack of accountability and transparency extended to the entire 20bn expended by the cpa
7002136 instead the cpa hired an obscure consulting firm called north star consultants inc the firm was so small that it reportedly operates out of a private home in san diego
7002137 did not perform a review of internal controls as required by the contract
7002138 the subject of todays hearing is the cpas use and accounting for funds belonging to the iraqi people held in the so called development fund for iraq these are not appropriated american funds they are iraqi funds i believe the cpa discharged its responsibilities to manage these iraqi funds on behalf of the iraqi people
7002139 i have no idea i cant tell you whether or not the money went to the right things or didnt nor do i actually think its important
7002140 but the fact is billions of dollars have disappeared without trace
7002141 of their money billions of dollars of their money yeah i understand im saying what difference does it make
7002142 i acknowledge that i made mistakes and that with the benefit of hindsight i would have made some decisions differently our top priority was to get the economy moving again the first step was to get money into the hands of the iraqi people as quickly as possible
7002143 there were explosions there were flashes there was molten metal running down the i beams of the basement levels like lava flows ive never seen anything like it yes planes hit the buildings anybody who says otherwise is a moron but the explosions the rapid symmetrical sequential explosions they happened
7002144 one of the huge steel and concrete support pillars with an 8 foot section blown out of the center of it
7002145 one after the other every minute or so at one point about 10 minutes before the first collapse a 30 foot or so section of the courtyard exploded straight up into the air just before the collapses a series of deep below ground explosions then numerous explosions in the buildings upper floors then we ran we felt the same deep explosions before the second collapse this was not just the planes
7002146 the buildings were rigged there is no question about it
7002147 by 11 30 a m the fire commander in charge of that area assistant chief frank fellini ordered firefighters away from it for safety reasons
7002148 reminiscent of those pictures weve all seen too much on television before where a building was deliberately destroyed by well placed dynamite to knock it down
7002149 there were bright flashes up and down the sides of building 7 you could see them through the windows and it collapsed we all knew it was intentionally pulled they told us
7002150 to be employed in response to another 9 11 type terrorist attack on the united states
7002151 we are against the war but we support the war on terrorism
7002152 israel is in the greatest danger it has been in since 1967 prior to 67 many wondered if israel would survive after 67 israel seemed military dominant despite the 73 war i would say we are now back to question of survival
7002153 lose two or three cities to nuclear weapons or more than a million to biological weapons
7002154 freedom as we know it will disappear and we will become a much grimmer much more militarized dictatorial society
7002155 people are greatly underestimating how dangerous the world is becoming ill repeat it three nuclear weapons are a second holocaust our enemies are quite explicit in their desire to destroy us they say it publicly we are sleepwalking through this process as though its only a problem of communication
7002156 our enemies are fully as determined as nazi germany and more determined that the soviets our enemies will kill us the first chance they get there is no rational ability to deny that fact its very clear that the problems are larger and more immediate than the political systems in israel or the us are currently capable of dealing with
7002157 we dont have right language goals structure or operating speed to defeat our enemies my hope is that being this candid and direct i could open a dialogue that will force people to come to grips with how serious this is how real it is how much we are threatened if that fails at least we will be intellectually prepared for the correct results once we have lost one or more cities
7002158 citizens who do not wake up every morning and think about the possible catastrophic civilian casualties are deluding themselves
7002159 if we knew that tomorrow morning we would lose haifa tel aviv and jerusalem what we would to stop it if we knew we would tomorrow lose boston san francisco or atlanta what would we do today those threats are probably one two five years away although you cant be certain when our enemies will break out
7002160 the war in lebanon demonstrated that israel is facing a jihadist threat that runs through tehran to damascus to gaza hizbullah are not fighting for the coming into being of a palestinian state but for the going out of being of the israeli state
7002161 for all of the soviets deep flaws they were never suicidal soviet commitment to national survival was never in question that assumption cannot be made to an irrational regime iran that celebrates martyrdom
7002162 we wanted to be different this is one name that will stay in peoples minds
7002163 we are not promoting hitler but we want to tell people we are different in the way he was different
7002164 this signifies a severe lack of awareness of the agony of millions of jews caused by one man
7002165 this place is not about wars or crimes but where people come to relax and enjoy a meal
7002166 what we did was insane and monstrous we covered entire towns in cluster bombs
7002167 international law does not include a sweeping prohibition of the use of cluster bombs the convention on conventional weaponry does not declare a prohibition on phosphorous weapons rather on principles regulating the use of such weapons
7002168 for understandable operational reasons the idf does not respond to accounts of details of weaponry in its possession
7002169 the idf makes use only of methods and weaponry which are permissible under international law artillery fire in general including mlrs fire were used in response solely to firing on the state of israel
7002170 i am safe because my name is blah blah i am special because my girlfriend loves me i have a good job my body looks great and im better than most people of course if i lost all of this i would have know idea who i am and life would lose all meaning
7002171 if they do not free themselves from their mind in time they will be destroyed by it they will experience confusion conflict violence illness despair madness egoic mind has become like a sinking ship if you dont get off you will go down with it the collective egoic mind is the most dangerously insane and destructive entity to inhabit this planet what do you think will happen on this planet if human consciousness remains unchanged
7002172 as soon as the green light is given it will be one mission one strike and the iranian nuclear project will be demolished
7002173 the time is approaching when israel and the international community will have to decide whether to take military action against iran
7002174 outbursts on the sun like this have been extremely infrequent over the past 30 years
7002175 what is more we have never had a chance to observe such emissions with the sun at its minimal activity
7002176 outbursts on the sun like this have been extremely infrequent over the past 30 years
7002177 what is more we have never had a chance to observe such emissions with the sun at its minimal activity
7002178 such a large cloud of hot plasma has been released into space that even electronic equipment on space satellites may be damaged
7002179 if the area of the sunspots does not diminish in three or four days and the emissions continue it may have a serious influence on the magnetic field of the earth
7002180 we need to pay him all the due respect any society would show to a distinguished statesman
7002181 giant of the time when advocacy was at its best
7002182 we wish to conclude that what the ndc needs is grace and this no man can give them the earlier they confronted the truth squarely the better for them
7002183 we cannot repeat here the insults that dr ampofo poured on our president and i dont intend to pay him in his own coin
7002184 but we also know that all these efforts were to no avail
7002185 it pleased god to bring forth to us this otherwise hidden treasure during president kufuors tenure in office
7002186 but the grace of god played the greater role and president kufuor acknowledges this everyday
7002187 we can understand the frustration that comes when failure attends to all your efforts
7002188 it is common knowledge that oil exploration in ghana began as far back as 1893 we all know that from the colonial governments up until now under president kufuor every government has endeavored to explore for oil in this country we are aware of the efforts the pndc ndc made in this area over their 19 long years in office but we also know that all these efforts were to no avail
7002189 missing out on every good thing that has happened to this country including the national health insurance scheme the school feeding programme the capitation grant ghanas participation in the world cup the hosting of the au summit debt cancellation the construction of the bui dam and the several other epoch making initiatives of this government
7002190 the united states and ghana enjoy warm relations and a shared commitment to promote peace and prosperity in africa and throughout the world
7002191 the two presidents will discuss efforts to combat malaria and neglected tropical diseases as well as ghanas efforts to promote democratic values peace and stability in africa
7002192 so many people most of who are youth normally attend natures call in the gutter early in the morning therefore i fear more people might be burnt alive under the valley
7002193 i was asleep when i heard a huge bang and i thought the world was coming to an end so i quickly rushed out only to see the tanker lying on its side
7002194 i didnt know the lady was menstruating until morning when i saw some blood on the bed and became alarmed and when i asked the lady she confirmed that she was in her period
7002195 the lady even told me that she did everything possible to stop me from having sex with her in that condition but because i was drunk i did not budge
7002196 to my utter surprise the snake which had been kept in a locked box and placed under a bed had come out by itself and was crawling on the floor
7002197 when i returned and saw that the snake had moved back to its box i thought it had begun vomiting money again but to my chagrin the snake had not vomited even a penny
7002198 every morning i just have to open the box and retrieve whatever money the snake had vomited
7002199 when i went to fox fm they told me to bring the snake before they could help me so i brought the snake to the station last tuesday evening
7002200 i can only help him if he fulfils the condition i have given him
7002201 my snakes hate blood of menstruating women so i warned him sternly to stay away from such women so that he could enjoy the money for long

7002208 charmees previous film mantram an action flick did well in the box office in 16 days she is going to have a bit of action too the plot basically talks about any thing that can happen ones life in just 16 days but the rest of the story is a secret
7002209 the tatas will be accorded a red carpet welcome to set up the project in maharashtra and will be given land and necessary facilities

7002212 no elections will be able to change the nature of the palestinian authority
7002213 the us will attack iran and hit it in order to thwart its nuclear ability as the diplomatic activity has failed
7002214 i believe that the us will use a military operation to save the world
7002215 bush and blair have a historical role in dealing with the iranian threat
7002216 thanks guys for saving us but we can look after ourselves now will you please kindly leave
7002217 after the number of violent incidents against researchers it seems to me they do need some additional protection over and above what the criminal law provides now
7002218 i dont want the law interfering with people getting information
7002219 on behalf of my dog hed like to remain intact
7002220 what works for mr levine in los angeles county wont necessarily work in alpine or modoc county
7002221 i would not rush for that deadline just to get a bad deal
7002222 dont get me wrong television needs regulators just as roads need traffic wardens
7002223 but you wouldnt ask your traffic warden to give you advice on what sort of car to buy still less how to drive it
7002224 try hanging them outside a west end theatre see who buys a ticket
7002225 were in show business night after night audiences turn on the television because they think it will entertain them if they dont they can do other things
7002226 unless we fight hard to assert the importance of mass audiences we may find that broadcasting as we know it simply goes niche and splits into a thousand pieces
7002227 no point in lingering by the water cooler any more the chances of anybody having watched the same programme as you last night are remote
7002228 we did our best to create a rendering that would look like the shot was taken live
7002229 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7002230 i didnt take sen bidens comments personally but obviously they were historically inaccurate african american presidential candidates like jesse jackson shirley chisholm carol moseley braun and al sharpton gave a voice to many important issues through their campaigns and no one would call them inarticulate

7002237 what the photographs herein reveal is that china is not just one place one people but 33 distinct regions populated by 56 different ethnicities each with their own languages customs and lifestyles
7002238 it is my most sincere hope that this book unites the people immortalized in its pages tibetan pilgrims and beijing scholars uyghur muslims and shanghai bankers hong kong millionaires and shanxi miners in celebration of their glorious cultures
7002239 tom carter is an extraordinary photographer whose powerful work captures the heart and soul of the chinese people
7002240 charlie chaplin could do a better job of running the home office than this labour government
7002241 the home office is entrusted with a great deal of highly confidential material and it seems to be entirely incapable of keeping it secure and the consequences are very serious theyre serious because it may lead to the identity of the people involved being revealed
7002242 one of the possible consequences is that criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence
7002243 if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies that are meant to do research for you then you need to be absolutely certain that when you give such information away the company concerned have put into practice procedures that are just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed since the loss of the child benefit data
7002244 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses more personal information has been reported lost it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
7002245 the home office has informed us that an internal report will be carried out into the data security arrangements between the home office and its contractor pa consulting
7002246 is going to be dramatically less than the amount they had been receiving through the month of may
7002247 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7002248 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
7002249 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7002250 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7002251 if you trust every web site but not a government
7002252 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7002253 sure it started as a bet but somehow along the way i found out that i love you
7002254 its wonderful you cant explain the feeling you feel after the greatest olympics ever
7002255 all i can say is yo jamaican sprinters taking over the world
7002256 to me im a performer i come out here to be a performer and let the people enjoy themselves sometimes its good to enjoy yourself this is my work its my job if you dont enjoy your job it doesnt make any sense to actually do it because you wont have any fun
7002257 security forces were just quick to respond and soldiers and policemen caught up with the gang and killing one of the gunman the doctor is safely rescued
7002258 we cannot give his name because there is an ongoing pursuit operation but it appeared the slain kidnapper was from the town of guindulungan where soldiers and rebels clashed this week
7002259 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
7002260 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
7002261 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
7002262 our position is we are going to go forward we are preparing for trial
7002263 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
7002264 by participating in the scheduled departure program those who have had their day in court and have been ordered to leave the country have an opportunity to comply with the law and gain control of how their families are affected by their removal
7002265 he was a kindhearted kid you know i just loved him you know what im saying he would do anything for you if you asked him
7002266 had nothing to do with being gang related or racially motivated
7002267 i think he probably stood his ground and that ultimately led to his death
7002268 he said i told ryan that someday that mouth of his is going to get him in trouble but i never thought a kid would pull a trigger and shoot him
7002269 the dude was slapping him and smacking him on the back of his hands
7002270 it was just something he had to do in this area to survive
7002271 he had this tough exterior but if you really knew him he was not like that at all
7002272 eigentlich hat es etwas zu lange gedauert bis der erste sieg eingetreten ist
7002273 vor brands hatch lag ich in der meisterschaft auf position acht und habe mich jetzt auf den f nften rang nach vorne gearbeitet ich bin nat rlich sehr gl cklich dar ber und hoffe dass es auch in der restlichen saison so weitergeht
7002274 die erwartung sind wahrscheinlich bei jedem fahrer gleich ich m chte viele punkte machen bin in oschersleben allerdings der schwerste bmw daher wird es f r mich wohl recht schwierig werden aber ich war auch schon im vergangenen jahr mit reichlich ballast unterwegs
7002275 ich fahre sehr gerne auf dieser strecke und vor dem heimpublikum bin ich nat rlich extrem motiviert
7002276 ich hoffe einfach dass ich vern nftig punkten und in der meisterschaft weiter nach vorne kommen kann
7002277 das paket das sie haben das geht ja schon jahrelang so
7002278 ich denke einfach dass s bastien in der asphalt meisterschaft in der er in frankreich aufgewachsen ist sehr sehr viel gelernt hat und sich auf dem terrain mittlerweile auch sehr sehr gut auskennt nat rlich hat er auch davon profitiert dass er die letzten jahre hier so stark gefahren ist zudem hat er ein gutes auto und ein gutes team um sich herum
7002279 loeb ist einfach loeb warum hat michael schumacher so oft gewonnen es ist einfach ein typ fahrer an dem die anderen zu bei en haben
7002280 wenn du von vornherein schon sagst boah der ist hier wahrscheinlich nicht zu knacken dann f hrst du ja schon mal mit der einstellung los und das ist auch nicht die beste
7002281 denn normalerweise f hrst du jede veranstaltung los und sagst hier kann ich vorne mitfahren und hier werde ich ihn schlagen
7002282 da hat man demjenigen ein bisschen die luft herausgenommen der loeb h tte schlagen k nnen ich denke dass finnland der schl ssel war bei der deutschland rallye war von vornherein f r alle fahrer klar loeb zu schlagen ist schwierig oder schier unm glich mit dieser einstellung sind alle losgefahren dementsprechend haben alle ihren speed oder auch ihre zur ckhaltung angelegt
7002283 hirvonen hat so gut angefangen weil er zu anfang andere reifen drauf hatte als loeb und deshalb ist er da gut gefahren
7002284 ich glaube aber dass f r ihn von anfang an schon klar war dass er bei pr fungen wie baumholder das er nicht unbedingt mag zeitverluste in kauf nehmen muss ja ich sch tze dass mikko gedacht hat ich muss erst mal schauen wie lange es dauert bis er mir einfach davon f hrt

7002286 wir haben uns mit marco melandri geeinigt das bedeutet dass er die n chsten zwei jahre f r uns fahren wird der deal muss aber noch von kawasaki in japan abgesegnet werden
7002287 was anthony betrifft wird er kommende saison nicht mehr teil des kawasaki motogp werksteams sein aber wir m chten ihm einen vertrag anbieten weiterhin ein kawasaki werkspilot zu bleiben
7002288 wir haben viel in ihn investiert um ihn auf einen bestimmten level zu hieven seit er vergangenes jahr bei uns eingestiegen ist
7002289 das k nnte bedeutet dass anthony f r uns in einer anderen meisterschaft f hrt
7002290 wenn wir eine dritte maschine bereitstellen liegt es an den sponsoren und dem management den fahrer zu bestimmen aber anthony west k nnte ein teil des pakets sein das wir anbieten in misano sollten wir offiziell best tigen k nnen dass melandri zu uns kommt und da sollten wir auch in der lage sein klarheit in die sache mit dem dritten motorrad zu schaffen

7002292 what the case is about is institutional failure to provide those necessary services
7002293 and with the settlement agreement which it negotiated with the plaintiffs approximately nine and a half years ago
7002294 most significantly it is about failure of the political leadership in the district of columbia government to make available the resources necessary to achieve compliance with the medicaid statute and the settlement agreement
7002295 we have substantial ground for an appeal and will continue to provide citizens of the district with quality medicaid service

7002301 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
7002302 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
7002303 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
7002304 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
7002305 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling

7002314 bioethanol akan pakai acuan harga internasional tapi kalau biodiesel kayaknya akan mengacu pada menko perekonomian karena mops itu grafiknya seiring dengan biodiesel
7002315 memang bbm tersebut tidak hanya fosil tapi terdapat juga nabati jadi kita tidak menambah volume hanya saja ada bagian fosil dan bagian nabati justru kami harapkan ini bisa mengurangi subsidi karena harga bioethanol dibawah mops
7002316 karena dalam keppres tersebut bbm yang disubsidi bbn belum termasuk jadi mungkin dari 38 juta kiloliter konsumsi bbm tahun 2008 akan ada sekitar sekian persen yang dari nabati
7002317 tapi terus saja yang kami fokus saat ini yaitu bbg bbg itu kan sekarang terus terang dari tahun 1978 80 kita belum mulai karena naik terus sekarang turun lagi sekarang kita coba push lagi

7002339 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7002340 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7002341 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7002342 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7002343 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7002344 tetapi apakah cukup sekadar penurunan 15 sen bagi petrol dan 8 sen bagi diesel sedangkan rakyat sudah semakin menderita dengan kekangan kos sara hidup yang semakin menggila dari hari ke hari
7002345 penurunan pada kadar 6 peratus tidak memberi apa apa signifikan langsung di sebalik penurunan harga mendadak harga minyak dunia yang kini dianggarkan pada kadar as115 setong

7002347 who should have their heads examined if they really believe mandatory psychiatric tests could help prevent ofws from snapping in the workplace
7002348 for the arroyo government those they have hailed as bagong bayani new heroes are lunatics
7002349 by refusing to acknowledge these realities and by conveniently glossing over the fact that most of the time ofws commit crimes to defend themselves others are just plain victims of frame up the dfa in essence is condemning our ofws
7002350 its such a shame that those who are directly responsible for pushing migrants rights are the ones who are blind and deaf to the real issues ofws face
7002351 if were to follow the dfas rationale then ofws like sarah balabagan mary jane ramos and joselito alejo are lunatics and not heroes as they were hailed when they arrived home after their ordeal overseas

7002355 sometimes at our age we think we know everything and we dont know anything thats the truth
7002356 i cannot remember any player who has left arsenal and been a superstar you know it is difficult dont get me wrong alex hleb and mathieu flamini are probably two of my best friends in football i wish them all the best i speak to them every week
7002357 arsenal is arsenal and this club has something special that no others have we have to take care of it thats why you have to be intelligent in your decisions
7002358 i know what this clubs has i have spoken to a lot of players i have friends in spain in italy and they speak to me about other clubs and i know that im privileged to be where i am and i dont want to lose it
7002359 im still young i want to win things for the club i want to get experience and i want to compete because when you see football around the world you see very few teams that play the way that we play and i just enjoy the way we play
7002360 what can i say hes my friend but apart from that hes a professional hes a great passer of the ball he works hard defensively hes scoring goals now for me it would be perfect
7002361 he has experience he has won the champions league he has got to another champions league final hes a european champion and hes only 26
7002362 of course right now we are competitive but maybe in the middle we need somebody who can make some competition who can add another dimension i think thats all we need really all the rest is fine
7002363 with the champions league we should not be afraid of anyone
7002364 we have seen in the last few season we have seen we can beat anybody so we have to be positive that this time we can make it to the final
7002365 i have been to a few finals now to understand what happens you can play well and lose and play not well and win i think we have the quality and the experience to do it

7002401 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden

7002406 this was unexpected we really did not expect to see the tumor promoting activity of these creams
7002407 we thought it would be prudent to test dermabase by itself to see if it had tumor promoting activity
7002408 we did not think it would but lo and behold to our surprise we got an increased rate of skin cancer
7002409 the answer is we dont know our study raises a red flag and points out the need for epidemiologists to take a look at people who use moisturizing creams and the companies that market these products should take a look at animal models and see if their products promote tumors
7002410 these creams need to be tested first before they come to market

7002415 it is such a tremendous gesture on his part and his colleagues to stop their rally and call us to wish us all the best and to wish the players
7002416 from the top it has been the pm the government the people the very fact they were glued to the television watching the table tennis team final speaks that theyre all behind us their good wishes they want us to win are a fantastic tremendous push for sports in general
7002417 there must be critics who felt that you are actually day dreaming but we dare to dream and i think once you dare to dream and with the proper strategy and commitment you can achieve so i would use the women table tennis as a clear example of what we can achieve

7002428 when you arise in the morning think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive to breathe to think to enjoy to love
7002429 in fact because i do not believe that religious people have a monopoly on morality i would rather have someone who is grounded in morality and ethics and who is also secular affirm their morality and ethics and values without pretending that theyre something theyre not they dont need to do that none of us need to do that
7002430 this brings me to my second point democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal rather than religion specific values it requires that their proposals be subject to argument and amenable to reason i may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons but if i seek to pass a law banning the practice i cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke gods will i have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths including those with no faith at all

7002502 no team has actually played at noon since we started this tournament
7002503 it affected both countries and most players didnt perform to their level because of the heat but we didnt make the rules they said play the game at 12 oclock which i dont think wasnt a good idea
7002504 it would do good for baseball like every sport to have the stars
7002505 we have lebron james in basketball we had michael jordan scottie pippen magic johnson that trend has continued in basketball and we have all the stars of the nhl
7002506 so we would love to have as many stars of the major leagues as possible
7002507 but baseball is such a big business in the united states players with potential to play in the big leagues arent allowed to come
7002508 i would like to be optimistic and hope that in 2016 we will have a chance again
7002509 it maybe carries a little more responsibility to really show how important baseball is not only to america but also to the netherlands to cuba

7002519 well if i say that this case is related to your sisters death
7002520 your sister died in a car accident however a witness saw ishikawa crews in that car so they might be involved with your sisters death

7002638 i grew up in midwest farm country and even then i was intrigued by new ways of farming
7002639 as i grew up i learned that there were new ways to grow fruits vegetables and flowers when i discovered hydroponics it gave me a vision of the future to work towards and now i am asking senators obama and mccain to look to the hydroponics industry as they make their campaigns farm policies
7002640 while mccain and obama have many differences with each other about their farm policies neither of them are considering the numerous benefits of hydroponics
7002641 hydroponics farming receives not one single penny of the millions available in federal subsidies or any other support even though more and more people are staking their future on hydroponics farming
7002642 the european countries are well ahead of the us on this old world technology
7002643 whoever gets elected obama or mccain they ought to consider giving a helping hand to an industry that can create millions of jobs use far less ag chemicals and produce very high yields in very small spaces
7002644 we created advanced nutrients and are now seeing hydroponics catching hold in the suburbs and for commercial farming
7002645 as obama and mccain debate the 300 billion farm bill they ought to consider that hydroponics is the farming wave of the future

7002748 in the last 6 olympic games there is an average 19 12 increase in the hosting countries stock indexes in the six months following the games in the 12 month after the olympics the stock indexes had a strong 26 14 average increase
7002749 these factors caused the increase on the stock market 6 months after the sporting event
7002750 the infrastructure construction system establishment and environmental protection among others for the olympics gave a lasting boost to the hosting countries economy therefore although gdp growth in those hosting countries showed a certain degree of slow down generally speaking the hosting countries economy maintained a relatively high speed of growth whats more the reduction of bubbles in the post olympics capital market has typically ensured steady and benign growth history clearing indicates that the lasting winner of the beijing olympics will be the beijing economy

7002765 oh barrys just pissed because it doesnt stop at his front door
7002766 it was an edgy nervous game because when you are one up your fans want to be reassured with another goal
7002767 he had a few opportunities to score the second goal and didnt do it give him time and watch him score
7002768 i cannot understand their disappointment with him his heart is with the club
7002769 i believe he has been unfairly treated why because when i met him many times in the summer he had a lot of interest from many big clubs
7002770 but he always told me his preference was to stay
7002771 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
7002772 dr thaksin has been really open he has said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing
7002773 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper its almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
7002774 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets
7002775 the truth of it is this club is not bankrupt were moving forward
7002776 but the hurdle is is there never going to be any more money dr thaksin says this will all resolve itself but i need some time so thats great
7002777 the electronic systems which guarantee our safety aboard the ss free gaza and ss liberty have been jammed and scrambled
7002778 i think the option we would have if we were not given the six months there is a really high likelihood that we would no bid the program

7002780 maar af en toe prikkelen bepaalde ontwikkelingen ons tot een uitspraak
7002781 het blijft een grote zorg dat ons kerkbestuur te weinig dualisme kent
7002782 het blijft een zorg dat ons kerkbestuur te weinig dualisme kent
7002783 its a project theyve left undone for over 12 years
7002784 to say the project was never complete i think the understanding was we would do as much as we could with 4m
7002785 there was quite an understanding that it would be expensive to do the middle section with the s curve because it involved property takings
7002786 the kids the old people that walk our streets the people with disabilities that live in the community they use it i use it ive used it since i was a kid
7002787 weve had to repair our driveway couple times and its already cracked and since last year i repaired it
7002788 i think theyre very lucky they got these improvements at no expense to the property owners
7002789 this wont go away were going to keep pressing it its a dangerous part of nihi street
7002790 directly wrote articles edited and approved without checking sources news and articles with seriously untrue information concerning the pmu18 case
7002791 paying the price for his news on a matter which is not yet over but which unravels in a very strange manner
7002792 instigated objections against legal protection agencies for investigating and arresting journalists nguyen viet chien and nguyen van hai
7002793 we think this has a negative effect on other journalists who want to report whatever story they can find
7002794 we hope that as soon as possible the government will publish a full explanation of exactly what were the charges they found out and what were the results of their ultimate investigation
7002795 we are still seeking clarification about the accident from the south african authorities
7002796 cant put into words how much i will miss you you are an amazing person you will never be forgotten r i p marci xxx
7002797 dear sirs i have knowledge that a friend of mine mr b carter was involved in a car crash seems like his spouse father in low and mother were killed in the accident where can i find some details about the accident because i dont know in which hospital my survived friend is in
7002798 i talked to charlie about it its something you just shrug your shoulders about and scratch your head sometimes you take hitting for granted you think its going to happen and then when you dont hit everybodys trying so damn hard to pick up the other guy that you get in your own way
7002799 we have to get back to how we used to hit
7002800 he asked me if i had started growing dreadlocks yet
7002801 es w re gut f r den baseball wie f r alle sportarten wenn die stars dabei w ren
7002802 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
7002803 the doctors are convinced that this should prolong my career
7002804 after watching the olympics it really motivated me to come here and get better times
7002805 i kind of remembered how michael phelps did it and tried to swim like him he is just so good
7002806 we have had unprecedented interest in auditions for swim teams
7002807 we are maxed out in four of eight practice groups and we expect to fill everything
7002808 we typically enjoy a membership spike the year after every olympics
7002809 we hope that will be larger than normal because of the phelps phenomenon
7002810 what he has done is so phenomenal and the way he has done it makes his appeal universal
7002811 it was really worth it to see him break that world record
7002812 we have a black population and there are some kids who gravitate to swimming because of race and identifying with cullen
7002813 that i am able to add a coach with the experience and credentials of jeff ruland to my staff is exciting
7002814 hell be an invaluable resource for our players particularly our big men and an asset to the organization as a whole
7002815 its weird the way things work out thats the first time i pitched against him
7002816 i was telling him all my struggles and he was telling me how he deals with it the mental side and stuff like that
7002817 he talked to me for a long time he was really nice i was really fortunate to be able to talk to him for that long out there obviously hes been doing something right
7002818 my last couple of outings have not been good at all so its nice to come out here and give us a chance to win
7002819 my sinker was good my slider was better really its just attacking the strike zone being aggressive and getting ahead
7002820 made quality pitches down in the strike zone he did a better job on righthanded hitters early in the game
7002821 if he doesnt have his sinker hes in big trouble
7002822 if this had just been a race in europe i probably would have stepped off the track
7002823 but this is the olympics i gave it everything i had but there was really nothing more i could do
7002824 it just limited the things i could do in training especially the speed work
7002825 i dont think i was running 100 meters in 17 seconds
7002826 i just knew there was no way i was going to get it done
7002827 ive already got some races set up for europe hopefully i can get some good results at either 5k or 10k id hate to finish with a memory like this from the olympics
7002828 im not a guy to complain ill get back in the gym to work and get better
7002829 im just thanking god over and over and over so thankful i want to cry
7002830 she was as much a victim in this whole thing as anyone
7002831 obviously not physically but to have to witness the things she had to see and go through the loss she had to endure is not an easy thing its a testament to her strength that shes working through it
7002832 we talk a couple of times a day three if need be we try to stay in as constant contact as we can because even though im here we all are in it together
7002833 she said she appreciates our effort and all that weve done
7002834 certainly its good for her family to see were out here trying as hard as we can whether thats a tribute or not is up to them the last two weeks have been a roller coaster i would say as a person who is not fond of roller coasters
7002835 the olympics is already emotionally charged fighting for your country for pride then you throw in the bachman tragedy you throw in miles britton a make a wish foundation kid we had in our camp his only wish was to watch usa volleyball play
7002836 im not so sure four years ago the team wouldnt have folded
7002837 im going to attribute that change to hugh mccutcheon when he came in he decided we werent going to settle for being middle of the road for being maybe a contender he got a new philosophy of working hard working together no superstars everyone bought into it
7002838 obviously we would have understood if he wanted to go home
7002839 the olympics are the olympics its not life its two weeks of your life that are important but not nearly as important as your family your wife and her family
7002840 is i know so many more lives are invested in this than just my own in terms of what our team is trying to do here given that responsibility given that im the leader of this team i know theres some accountability on my part to make sure im here and able to do my job
7002841 that is one of the many admirable traits about him
7002842 its a fantastic achievement and ill embrace it and enjoy it but as soon as were done ive got to get back where im needed
7002843 i just wonder why they call this place the coliseum maybe every time everybody comes here they get ready to be killed
7002844 i talked to him the other day and i told him i really like what i see but you need to play with more tenacity
7002845 he has a tendency to cadillac it a little bit and i just wanted to make sure he got into the right habits joyce is a hustler though dont get me wrong
7002846 you cant help but feel a little homesick every once in a while but i love it here
7002847 ich f hle mich gerade etwas hilflos nach dieser siegesserie muss man das erstmal verdauen
7002848 ich habe mich auf platz vier gesehen umso sch ner war es dann ich bin supergl cklich das ist f r mich wie eine goldene platz drei ist total genial
7002849 we wanted them to have an area of their own they plant the seeds each spring
7002850 thats where i learned how much work it was to grow dahlias
7002851 when we planted them the trees were the same size as the kids
7002852 and they always come and replace their flowers during the week
7002853 i think what he meant to say was when youre going good theyre on your side and when youre going bad they get on you
7002854 i dont want to come out of this game he said i had to give him the benefit of the doubt its only fair to him for what hes brought to the team
7002855 this hasnt been a case of alex and shaun not performing well
7002856 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
7002857 a loose ligament and im waiting to get more info on what i need to do
7002858 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
7002859 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here
7002860 and he was like dont worry mon we got this one
7002861 i would like that i went to the futures game eastern league all star olympics
7002862 you come out here knowing you have to win every game thats what youre trying to do up in the big leagues win every game
7002863 once we saw their best player go down we let up
7002864 they cut the lead to nine or something like that
7002865 melo was trying to protect howard and we were trying to protect melo
7002866 it got a little chippy out there nothing personal im going to get an ice bath
7002867 weve got to play better than what we did tonight
7002868 she hasnt said a word about it but lisa deserves everything that comes to her
7002869 everybody hears it why dont we have a big stud but if you can get that out of your mind for one second i know its difficult for a lot of people but we think we have six really really good receivers
7002870 theyve all played well when theyve got a chance to play
7002871 hank a couple years ago made some big plays for us greg lewis has made big plays in the super bowl he scored a touchdown jason avant we think is going to be a super inside player and then you add desean to the mix and we think we have a very good group of receivers we think theres no question in our minds we can win the super bowl with these receivers
7002872 i think you have to give guys opportunities to make plays and we did that
7002873 its obviously big when you lose somebody like kevin and then you dont have your other top receiver in reggie brown i think the preseason gives guys an opportunity to come out and showcase their talents and do great things for us we have a ways to go but its a good sign
7002874 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
7002875 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7002876 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7002877 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7002878 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7002879 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7002880 our school does its best to train them to be professional to join in the olympics
7002881 the sports schools in some ways are a metaphor for chinese culture as a whole
7002882 american athletes theres a story about some kid in the middle of idaho and they started running
7002883 in china everybody seems to have the same story they were identified when they were 4 because they had long arms or double jointed elbows and then theyre incorporated into this little system that is designed to build champions
7002884 our system is designed for the people with passion and talent but ours is a much more organic process theirs is much more centrally organized china is a country run by engineers
7002885 thats been one of the dangers of this system they are really left to their own devices without skills without an education
7002886 they are denied their childhood in pursuit of this magical goal the nation will achieve its glory by tapping them like being tapped for the armed forces
7002887 i dont think its a coincidence that in china the chinese term for a retired athlete is the same as for a retired serviceman veteran
7002888 all in all i thought it was a good game in spots
7002889 i was glad to see we tackled better and caught the ball better than we did last week and then i thought our special teams played better it was good to see the young returners do some things i think theyre both explosive players
7002890 i just wanted to show to the fans everybody thats watching coaches everybody that im capable of getting the job done
7002891 im young im a rookie and things like that but i definitely feel i play very confident i just know what im capable of doing
7002892 you see three fat boys and a fast dude in front of you blocking
7002893 its the new england patriots theyre a very confident team and a great team also
7002894 dang he scored one before i did i knew the next time i got out there i was going to have to take it the distance because he took it the distance
7002895 i felt the punter kind of outkicked his coverage and i just did a great job of catching the ball and making two moves to the side and hitting the seam and getting right up the middle from there it was nothing but daylight
7002896 it wasnt the worst one weve seen it wasnt the simplest one weve seen
7002897 i definitely thought about that he scored one before i did
7002898 it went through my mind i thought the next time i get out ive got to take it the distance because he did its a very competitive game
7002899 theyre young and have a lot of energy they love to play veteran players love watching them
7002900 i thought it was a good game in some spots and in others where we need to pick up and do some work
7002901 i was glad to see we tackled better and caught the ball better than last week
7002902 you have to have a mentality that every time you have a shot to return it
7002903 my blockers i just trusted them so i could get going i took advantage of my opportunity
7002904 i felt the punter got a good kick on it and kind of outkicked his coverage i just did a great job of catching the ball and making two moves to the side hitting the seam and getting right up the middle from there it was nothing but daylight
7002905 we are progressing week in and week out i think you have to give guys opportunities to make plays and we did that
7002906 its all of them you take kobe out you put carmelo anthony in chris paul jason kidd i can keep going if you want
7002907 being a part of this is the biggest thing ever
7002908 as a team we were more aggressive against him tonight and i think seeing him in san diego last week had a lot to do with it
7002909 seeing him last week you have it in your head how he pitches to you
7002910 he followed the ball better and had a good smooth swing
7002911 i want him to get back to swinging like he did two years ago
7002912 he was just concentrating on hitting it hard and it was going out of the ballpark when he gets back to that thought process hell hit 300 again i want him back to that cut
7002913 ted williams said 90 percent is from the head up and i wouldnt argue with ted williams
7002914 it was nice to get a combination of quality hitting and pitching in one game
7002915 thats what were going to have to do if were going to overtake the mets
7002916 and the ioc and fig should take measures to make sure the issue is put to rest one way or another we believe the ioc is moving in that direction we hope they follow through and hope for a quick resolution
7002917 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
7002918 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here
7002919 usain wanted to start he wanted to lay the hammer down from the start
7002920 the coaches wanted him to run the third leg we listened to the coaches
7002921 all i can say is yo jamaican sprinters taking over the world
7002922 the crowd loves it they love when i put on a show for them
7002923 they come out and pay their money to see a good performance and also to see a personality so i go out there and give them a show
7002924 no sabemos nada de eso pero es posible que haya habido un acuerdo en el nivel m s alto del que no hemos sido informados
7002925 ive watched it a couple of different times earlier in the year it helps to an extent
7002926 they did it last week in that four game series out there especially on utley and howard
7002927 if i split them they might not be so eager to bring them in on us
7002928 its a good test of who we are were going to see you have to beat good clubs we have to try to win some games to overtake the mets
7002929 it was disappointing but put yourself in my shoes i was 28 in the prime of my career had had surgery the previous season and came back to play in the playoffs in the best shape of my life
7002930 my left surgically repaired leg was stronger than my right but they told me i had degenerative arthritis
7002931 life is adversity and how you handle it thats why im excited about coming back here with people i know in a great organization with a team that has some talent
7002932 i told coach maurice cheeks if he needs me to sell popcorn ill do that too
7002933 that i am able to add a coach with the experience and credentials of jeff ruland to my staff is exciting
7002934 hell be an invaluable resource for our players particularly our big men and an asset to the organization as a whole
7002935 we had some big hits throughout the lineup tonight and were able to get runs across
7002936 they swept us there coming off a loss we really wanted to come out today and obviously win a game
7002937 hopefully we can continue this for the rest of the year
7002938 were going to have to if we are going to overcome the mets were going to have to have games like this throughout the rest of the year
7002939 just to be back among the guys i really feel like im close to where i need to be for the opener and im definitely going to get there in two weeks
7002940 i was very pleased with the exception of a couple of plays
7002941 its important for the offensive line to come together and be able to work together with the different calls so the running backs can see the different styles
7002942 shawn is a little bit different than max jean gilles in the way he protects and the way he moves around a little bit
7002943 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted to this league
7002944 its all good they will probably give me the boos give me the yeahs
7002945 kareenas song is crucial to the story of billoo barber like her famous song in don that people cannot forget similarly people will never forget the billoo barber number kareenas name will become synonymous with the number
7002946 shahid was shooting for vishal bharadwajs kaminay in pune on august 11 it was shri rams birthday who lives in bangalore shahid called him to pune and just told shri ram that he had some urgent work and needed him to come to pune it was only when shri ram came to pune that he realised that shahid had thrown a surprise birthday get together for him sources reveal that shahid had earlier requested vishal bharadwaj and packed up early so that he could spend more time with his friend vishal and the entire crew of kaminay were not only surprised but also moved to see this human side of shahid
7002947 anyone who doesnt vote for my candidate is an idiot
7002948 watch out theres a psycho pretending to sell women perfume in parking lots who gets into your car
7002949 this is exactly what you want to catch before flying to here we go again

7002965 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7002966 the last time andrew fintoff batted like that with me was at edgbaston against australia in 2005 we gave him a new role at number five the man is a superstar i am fortunate to have a bloke like that who i can throw the ball to say knock over the stumps
7002967 we asked a lot of the players but we wont be resting on our laurels the team were brilliant we started off well and built a good foundation
7002968 and this is the stage where steve harmison belongs he should be playing in front of 30 000 40 000 50 000
7002969 we know they can hit the ball but if we get our execution right we should never be going for 98 in the last ten there is a feeling in the dressing room we can do a lot better
7002970 we pride ourselves on being better than that but england deserved their win they played with a lot more skill

7002976 dans la journ e restriction du personnel au maximun je dis bien au maximum les l ves infirmieres qui sont en stage en t servent de bouche trou uniquement aucun encadrement puisque pas de personnel cest pas compliqu comprendre je passe sous silence et pourtant cest v ridique la maltraitance physique et morale subies par les malades langage de poissonni re pour certaines soignantes qui consid rent les personnes ag es comme des objets et rien de plus gros porc et jen passe

7003182 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
7003183 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
7003184 the great coaches out there are not available at the drop of a hat
7003185 its a fair perception from people looking in from the outside that sean and i are on trial going into the season but we see it slightly differently
7003186 we are welcoming the fact that if the right person comes along that he comes in here because as young coaches we want to learn from the best
7003187 wed love for some guy to come in here and take us to the next level as coaches
7003188 sometimes you have to wait for the the right person
7003189 if that person is available then whats been said is that the management have enough confidence in us to wait as long as it takes whether thats six months or a year

7003195 as far as britney getting back in the studio its obviously a good thing if shes doing what she loves because shes had a love for music for such a long time then im all for it
7003196 im glad shes pulling it together because everybody falls down in life at one time or another the toughest part is how do you pick yourself up again it looks like shes on the path to doing that and its a good thing to see
7003197 we are discussing potentially how the league will look but there is no timetable or urgency to that
7003198 we had a very good meeting with the cba yesterday
7003199 we are both committed to growing the sport of basketball in china developing its grass roots and developing the leagues presence
7003200 its a very complex situation for which we are going to work very hard to find a suitable solution
7003201 it was a dream game all i could think of was thank god the ball went over the line and now thanks to that i have a gold medal
7003202 we didnt play our best football today but this victory is a good one for us
7003203 the fact that we have been to the athletes village and met famous sportsmen its all an experience that we will not forget quickly
7003204 messi terrorises not only our team but all teams in europe he didnt score but he created a lot of their chances that is why we have the silver and they have the gold
7003205 were very disappointed but it means we came second in the we had a lot of good scoring chances but you have to score goals to win the gold medal
7003206 all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness
7003207 the last time andrew fintoff batted like that with me was at edgbaston against
7003208 we asked a lot of the players but we wont be resting on our laurels the team were brilliant we started off well and built a good foundation
7003209 and this is the stage where steve harmison belongs he should be playing in front of 30 000 40 000 50 000
7003210 we know they can hit the ball but if we get our execution right we should never be going for 98 in the last ten there is a feeling in the dressing room we can do a lot better
7003211 we pride ourselves on being better than that but england deserved their win they played with a lot more skill

7003230 we know the success of our season is based on how quickly we can focus again on club targets after international games
7003231 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
7003232 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
7003233 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay
7003234 i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that
7003235 people have advisors and some clubs pay higher wages than we do we have to accept that

7003238 si trattato di capire come una persona sana sia costretta a vivere costantemente ossessionata dalla paura sai bene che un attacco forte potrebbe portarti alla morte o a qualche infermit fisica sai che pu essere molto umiliante perch perdi totalmente il controllo delle tue funzioni corporee e tanta gente impreparata di fronte ad attacchi del genere e non sa come reagire quando si trova di fronte una persona malata di epilessia
7003239 ad un certo punto mi ero convinto che i miei occhi avrebbero rappresentato un vero problema
7003240 abbiamo provato con le lenti a contatto ma il vero problema era che le mie pupille non si muovevano mai e quindi avevo laspetto di un aneroide ero insieme ad alexandra maria lara che interpreta annik nella roulotte del trucco e appena mi ha guardato in faccia ho capito che cera qualcosa che non andava ho continuato ad indossarle durante le prove per un paio di ore di fila e tutti coloro che erano l pensavano che fosse la scelta giusta ma io non le avevo mai usate prima dora pregavo con tutto il cuore di non doverle usare per il film in fondo si tratta dellinterpretazione di una storia e di una persona e infatti io non gli occhi di ian perch non sono ian
7003241 i feel as if i am walking with destiny and that all my past life has been but a preparation for this hour and for this trial i have nothing to offer but blood toil tears and sweat we have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind we have before us many many long months of struggle and suffering

7003260 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7003261 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7003262 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7003263 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7003264 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7003265 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7003266 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7003267 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7003268 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7003269 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7003270 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7003271 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7003272 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7003273 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7003274 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7003275 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7003276 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7003277 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7003278 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7003279 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7003280 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7003281 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7003282 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7003286 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7003287 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7003288 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7003289 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7003290 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7003291 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7003292 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7003293 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7003294 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7003295 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7003296 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7003297 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7003298 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7003299 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7003300 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7003301 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7003302 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7003303 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7003304 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7003305 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7003306 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7003307 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7003308 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7003309 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7003310 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7003311 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7003312 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7003313 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7003314 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7003315 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7003316 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7003324 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7003325 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7003326 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7003327 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7003328 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7003329 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7003330 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7003331 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7003332 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7003333 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7003334 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7003335 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7003336 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7003337 we are having a meeting next wednesday about a lot of things and contracts will be one of the things discussed

7003352 the go to statement as it stands is just too primitive it is too much an invitation to make a mess of ones program one can regard and appreciate the clauses considered as bridling its use i do not claim that the clauses mentioned are exhaustive in the sense that they will satisfy all needs but whatever clauses are suggested e g abortion clauses they should satisfy the requirement that a programmer independent coordinate system can be maintained to describe the process in a helpful and manageable way
7003353 and while they are indeed hidden gotos they are acceptable as they are implemented in a very structured way in languages like java c c and many others on the other hand all constructs in structured languages are implemented with hidden gotos underneath

7003361 biking in the charleston region is very difficult but improving but there are warning signs
7003362 for the next fight i think we will be looking at someone in the top 10 top 15 ranked in the world kicketts trainer craig christian said
7003363 we were coming back from indonesia and the hot weather and it was freezing in perth and i had the flu and ive still got it a little bit kickett said
7003364 when i got back for a week and a half i didnt train or anything i only had about two weeks to get fit again for the fight but i was pretty fit before i got sick
7003365 that was why i think he didnt stop him because of a lack of energy but he paced himself well if he would have had a full preparation he would have stopped him christian said
7003366 i wasnt listening at the start but during the rounds i started listening a bit more and going to my right instead of moving to my left all the time kickett said
7003367 after being sick i was pretty happy with my performance i think it was pretty good i was just taking my time a bit more and trying stuff id never done and i was trying to practise combinations
7003368 he just kept coming forward he was a pretty good fighter and his head was very tough kickett said

7003376 es gibt keinen sch rferen kritiker an barack obamas fehlender erfahrung als joe biden
7003377 i like driving this track it is different to other street circuits we have had and yesterday when i walked it i thought it would be fun today just confirmed that impression for me
7003378 there are some very quick parts and almost everywhere there is a lot of room it is maybe similar to some of the north american circuits used in the past
7003379 they have done a really good job we have got off to a good start but it is too early to say where we are in relation to the opposition i think overtaking will be difficult as always i hope i dont need to worry about it so i am concentrating on getting the best position for qualifying
7003380 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on the set up this morning we were able to go faster on each run without changing too much and had a good baseline for the afternoon session
7003381 in p2 this afternoon our adjustments were again spot on but the sheer volume of traffic meant that it was difficult to confirm immediately our final set up changes i think we are in pretty good shape and i am looking forward to saturday
7003382 the track was very green this morning which meant there was little point in making big changes to the car
7003383 but we made some in the afternoon and they seemed to pay off i felt the car was working well by the end of the session and the balance was good
7003384 this is a good start to the weekend for us all and i must say that it is a great circuit
7003385 the organisers have done a first class job and especially bernie ecclestone f1s commercial ring master for this maiden race here in valencia
7003386 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7003387 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7003388 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7003389 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7003390 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7003391 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7003392 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7003393 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7003394 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7003395 my whole career has been about resolving access issues this is my battle horse
7003396 private delivery is an accepted practice everywhere in the world and its time canada accepted this reality
7003397 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7003398 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7003399 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7003400 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7003401 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7003402 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7003403 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7003404 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7003405 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7003406 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7003407 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7003408 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7003409 the strike is part of continuing protests against indias rule in kashmir
7003410 it is also to demand our right to self determination through a referendum
7003411 the fighting that is still raging has so far left five militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7003412 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7003413 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7003414 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7003415 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7003416 its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7003417 for the first time the city is light again and were having fun drinking
7003418 theyre blowing up all the equipment they cant take with them
7003419 they grabbed everything they could get their hands on they took our uniforms and even our restroom equipment
7003420 these are the ones who were too slow to run away
7003421 i dont want to bring him dead to his house
7003422 its bad that nobody from the georgian side even called to ask whether i was alive
7003423 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7003424 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7003425 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7003426 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7003427 it has been an amazing journey for me this past week i have been training so hard because to come back after the synchro i really wanted to put in a good performance
7003428 im going into the final now to enjoy myself and get the whole experience of what an olympic final is going to be like because in london 2012 that is what i am aiming for
7003429 to go into the olympic final in london i just need that experience from beijing
7003430 it just didnt go my way i dived well yesterday and i knew it was going to be a bit more of a struggle this morning but i didnt think it was going to be like that
7003431 she didnt win i won and thats it the judges can take your dreams away
7003432 i did everything i could have done the judges have to press their buttons for the score and my colour obviously wasnt working
7003433 my foot hit her face and i felt it so it was definitely a head shot
7003434 i was absolutely in my zone i made one mistake and she caught me
7003435 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7003436 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7003437 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7003438 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7003439 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7003440 the slump in the construction industry is hitting the migrant workers especially hard under the
7003441 is not and has never been a party to or bound by any union contract collective bargaining agreement or similar contract
7003442 the courts service pays lionbridge 46 per hour in turn lionbridge pays either 25 or 20 or 17 50 to the interpreters we have even heard reports of 15 per hour the rates vary depending on when the interpreters were recruited those recruited more recently are paid less
7003443 the reduction in pay is an alarming development interpreters used to complain that the hourly rate never increased despite inflation but they never expected reductions like these the itia believes that lionbridge favours the more recently recruited interpreters for interpreting assignments because they cost less
7003444 we must understand that technologies like these are the way of the future
7003445 we must understand that technologies like these are the way of the future
7003446 we must understand that technologies gt like these are the way of the future
7003447 we must understand that technologies like these are the way of the future
7003448 we must understand that technologies gt gt like these are the way of the future
7003449 we must understand that technologies gt like these are the way of the future
7003450 we must understand that technologies like these are the way of the future
7003451 hey jimi where you going with dat puke in your lungs
7003452 what sings flies into mountains and becomes an overnight sensation
7003453 mama cass has a ham sandwich it is her last
7003454 its terrible kay was a beautiful elegant woman and they were a devoted couple
7003455 he had a daughter in her mid 20s who has gone to stay with family after hearing the news
7003456 i feel so sorry for him and his daughter its so upsetting
7003457 they were lovely enjoyable people i am in complete shock they have moved away now but spend a lot of time in south africa
7003458 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7003459 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7003460 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7003461 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7003462 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7003463 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7003464 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7003465 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7003466 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7003467 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7003468 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7003469 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7003470 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7003471 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7003472 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7003473 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7003474 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7003475 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7003476 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7003477 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7003478 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7003479 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7003480 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7003481 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7003482 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7003483 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7003484 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7003485 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7003486 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7003487 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7003488 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7003489 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7003490 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7003491 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7003492 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7003493 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7003494 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7003495 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7003496 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7003497 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7003498 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next
7003499 there will be no change in monetary policy for the foreseeable future
7003500 the emphasis still is on the economic and market risks but still trying to walk a fine line on inflation as well
7003501 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely
7003502 is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective
7003503 add to this mix a jump in inflation in part the product of a global commodity boom and the result has been one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
7003504 we will continue to review all of our liquidity facilities to determine if they are having their intended effects or require modification
7003505 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7003506 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7003507 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone
7003508 we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7003509 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7003510 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7003511 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
7003512 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
7003513 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom
7003514 your site is amazing i love photography too hopefully i can learn a thing or two from you
7003515 you are an excellent professional and your blog is very special with great photos a hug from brazil
7003516 i dont understand your language but the photographs of your blog are very nice
7003517 you take beautiful photos i really enjoyed visiting your site thanks for sharing it with me
7003518 thanks for dropping by keep up with those great shots
7003519 we follow the statements made by political leaders in the west and are obliged to once again underline the russian position all the actions of russian peacekeepers are in line with the six principles signed by the presidents of russia and france
7003520 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7003521 i was so scared because bombs were falling on our homes but now it seems people will start returning and everything will be alright
7003522 bob osborne edwards crew chief said if i didnt win the pole hed be really ticked off because of the contact with the wall
7003523 but if thats all the damage we see in the next 24 to 36 hours well be all right
7003524 the poles huge for us at this track obviously track position and pit selection couldnt be more important
7003525 it was just a little free but actually better than i thought it would be
7003526 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn 2 because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit
7003527 i think we need to get used to great racing here being side by side racing rather than wreck each other racing
7003528 weve got more racing room here theres still going to be bumping and banging but its not going to be like it was before because its not a one groove racetrack anymore
7003529 i just got a little free and i felt like i would have enough track to chase it and just didnt get out of the throttle
7003530 in a normal situation i would have cracked the throttle and just slowed down a little bit but i felt like i could hold on for that extra split second and still get a good lap in our aaa ford was fast in practice so well have to put some of the same stuff that worked well in practice on our backup car and just try to make the best out of a bad situation
7003531 doctors nurses and other medical personnel face pressure to participate in abortion a practice that many find abhorrent in good conscience the enforcement of federal laws designed to protect their freedom of conscience is long overdue
7003532 doctors nurses and other medical personnel face pressure to participate in abortion a practice that many find abhorrent in good conscience
7003533 the enforcement of federal laws designed to protect their freedom of conscience is long overdue
7003534 catholics do not stand alone in opposition to the deliberate destruction of nascent human life all health care providers should be free to serve their patients without violating their most deeply held moral and religious convictions on the value of life
7003535 organizations calling themselves pro choice are actually pro coercion in seeking to deny the freedom of doctors and nurses
7003536 dont doctors have the right to choose not to participate
7003537 over the coming 30 days of public comment the bishops urge the pro life american public to thank secretary leavitt and encourage hhs to implement the strongest possible regulations
7003538 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults

7003544 matthew was eating a takeaway and realised he was being followed
7003545 as a result he fell backwards he tried to get up but was pushed again the defendant told him youre lucky i dont kill you give me your jeans
7003546 he then left the scene put on the jeans and discarded his own tracksuit he wanted to go to the nightclub
7003547 it was not robbery for the phone or money he simply wanted to go to the nightclub
7003548 there is an added humiliation for the victim in having to put on someone elses trousers it was particularly insensitive
7003549 i am giving you a second chance but if you do not take it i will have no qualms about putting you in prison
7003550 you are going pay your victim 1 000 for the utter humiliation you put him through
7003551 i also expect you to write a letter of apology which i want to see saying sorry for your disgusting behaviour
7003552 drink is the root and sole cause of his bad behaviour

7003573 f r alle kinder ist der schulbeginn nat rlich immer wieder etwas aufregendes aber etwas ganz besonderes ist er nat rlich speziell f r die taferlklassler f r die j ngsten sch lerinnen und ihre eltern bedeutet dieser allererste schultag nat rliche eine vielzahl an neuen herausforderungen nicht zuletzt auch was die gesundheit betrifft denn zum um einen hei t nat rlich die schule zumal dann wenn alles neu ist f r die kinder auch immer ein gewisses ma an stress und zum anderen ist nat rlich besonders f r die abc sch tzen der schulweg ein gefahrenpotential daher ist es wichtig dass eltern und kinder sich auch auf den beginn dieses neuen lebensabschnitts vorbereiten
7003574 es ist daher wichtig dass die eltern den neuen schulweg schon vor schulbeginn mit den kindern ben und die sch lerinnen auf die besonderen gefahrenstellen aufmerksam machen
7003575 ich m chte aber auch an alle autofahrerinnen appellieren speziell am schulanfang besonders aufmerksam zu sein und r cksicht auf unsere j ngsten und schw chsten verkehrsteilnehmerinnen zu nehmen
7003576 die bereits ausgezeichneten 11 steirischen genuss regionen haben sich erfolgreich etabliert mit den neuen genuss regionen ges use wild grazer krauth uptel steirischer kren und weststeirisches turopoljeschwein wird die genusslandkarte sterreichs um vier weitere steirische spezialit ten erweitert die steiermark leistet so einen enorm wichtigen beitrag zu regionaler qualit t und vielfalt dar ber hinaus wird graz heute zur genusshauptstadt sterreichs ausgerufen weil in dieser stadt die themen kulinarik und genuss eine wichtige rolle spielen
7003577 die genuss region sterreich tr gt viel zum image und der qualit t der heimischen lebensmittel bei gerade in zeiten der globalisierung des geschmacks sehnen sich die menschen nach mehr regionalit t und authentizit t bei den lebensmitteln der trend geht eindeutig in richtung genie en

7003580 so agrarisch bunt wie das genussland steiermark ist kaum ein anderes bundesland die vier neuen steirischen genussregionen erg nzen das repr sentative bild der lebensmittelvielfalt in der gr nen mark mit nunmehr insgesamt 15 steirischen genussregionen die wertsch tzung der regionalen b uerlichen betriebe sichert zudem nicht nur den genuss und die lebensmittelqualit t sondern schafft auch arbeitspl tze dort wo diese qualit tsprodukte angebaut bzw produziert werden dar ber hinaus sind diese lebensmittel kulinarische repr sentanten weit ber sterreichs grenzen hinweg
7003581 graz erf llt alle voraussetzungen f r die genusshauptstadt im grazer einzugsgebiet gibt es viele neue genuss regionen graz ist mit dem grazer krauth uptel nun auch selbst eine die grazer spitzengastronomie setzt auf kulinarische regionale gen sse insbesondere aus den genuss regionen

7003598 there was a certain householder which planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another again he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them likewise but last of all he sent unto them his son saying they will reverence my son but when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmen they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons jesus saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables they perceived that he spake of them but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the multitude because they took him for a prophet
7003599 the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner
7003600 whosoever fell on him was broken and on whomsoever he fell was ground to powder
7003601 should chris hoy be knighted yes he will be knighted im sure of that but after these games maybe not i gave up after my games
7003602 i believe he should be knighted on retirement if you knight him now and he gets four gold medals next time what do you then how do you recognise that you cant
7003603 hes an mbe that could be upgraded to a cbe and then in four years time when he wins another hatful he should be knighted
7003604 given that chris hoy has become the first uk athlete to win three golds at the same games in 100 years his achievements warrant official recognition sooner rather than later
7003605 hes a good looking guy has a nice personality and seems extremely grounded these are all the components i need
7003606 larkii you are our guest we should be giving this to you
7003607 dont you want to marry him he is a very good boy

7003609 so speed it up slow it down put it back in reverse my directions pay attention to my every word we can bump we can swerve but watch out for that curve on ya highway
7003610 so many people dream of one day having a business on the internet but the cost and the time it takes to get started prevent many from doing that the freedom team provided the help i needed to get started quickly and make a profit right away i was able to start a business for less than 20 and the freedom team helps me with a free advertising co op
7003611 tough on seagulls and tough on the causes of seagulls
7003612 i expect the task force to start making plans now ready to swing into action next spring to coincide with the next breeding season
7003613 they are now stealing food from peoples hands and harassing locals and visitors
7003614 its only a matter of time before a gull collides with someone and there is a serious injury
7003615 that would be cool but were still too far out to know exactly how its going to go
7003616 my rival each week is the guy in front of me you cant just focus on one particular driver you have to worry about everybody
7003617 carl has been good all year long he started the year out really strong and we knew we would have our work cut out for us with him
7003618 i knew they would catch up with us eventually all we can do is try to win what we can
7003619 if he gets some wins that will be fine if we get some wins that will be great too
7003620 if you get stuck on the inside of someone youll either fall back in line or stick it out
7003621 if youre handling well and turning pretty good eventually theyll get tight and wash up the track enough for you to get by them
7003622 its been a great year and im fortunate to be in this position theres still plenty of time left and anything can happen
7003623 the ultimate goal is to win the championship all we can do is work as hard as we can and hope for the best
7003624 i just cant thank my guys enough because they worked really hard that office depot fusion was just like it was in practice
7003625 crew chief bob osborne predicted how the track would be and did a good job i honestly didnt expect to sit on the pole here but i had an awesome car
7003626 aku sita supaya tidak bisa dijual supaya nanti bisa jatuh ke anak anak
7003627 he korey told me to be relaxed and just let the game come to me and thats what i did
7003628 ive been working at fullback and halfback all season so i was pretty familiar with both the positions
7003629 the holes were huge anybody could have run through those holes
7003630 kyle kennedy stepped in there and did a fine job
7003631 proved that they worked hard and understood some of what we wanted them to do
7003632 i was a little disappointed in the first half i dont think we tackled as well as we should part of it is twin valley theyve got two really good running backs
7003633 in the second half i thought we came out and did a whole lot better on the defensive end
7003634 bland is fast coach hart had them in the right place they blitzed at the right time were big but were not experienced enough to take on the speed that he had
7003635 youve got to give no 2 over there shrader credit he made plays on defense on our pass routes and stuff hes a great football player he hurt us big time
7003636 garrett hornes a phenomenal player if we give him a hole an inch hell take it and hes going to go and get his yards hes a great athlete he plays hard
7003637 all my kids play hard i think weve got nine athletes who play both ways and its hard on them
7003638 swarmed the ball and thats what ive got to get our kids to do
7003639 twin valley improved a whole lot from last year they were a lot more physical and had more speed theyre going to win some games this year
7003640 we beat a good football team tonight and they kept coming after us in the second half
7003641 it was the pressure of the game and we have a lot of young kids
7003642 we made too many mistakes and gate city is a well coached football team and you cant beat a good football team with that many turnovers
7003643 we have to come out next week and correct our mistakes
7003644 well take this loss and itll make us better well learn from our mistakes
7003645 were always disappointed with how the season ends if we dont win the state championship
7003646 weve worked really really hard and weve worked since february on conditioning
7003647 we think were ready to start the season tomorrow and see what happens
7003648 thats a little bit of a challenge because the goalkeepers so important in the game of soccer
7003649 both of them are inexperienced but both of them bring quickness and a lot of skills otherwise
7003650 they both understand the position and how to play the game and then they have the attitude they want to be good keepers
7003651 so defense early in the year is going to be a challenge we hope that by the end of the year it wont be
7003652 were hoping they jell tomorrow two minutes into the game or we may be hurting
7003653 weve got winfield coming in tomorrow and theyve got nine starters returning from a team that was 12 4 2 theyre going to be strong so wed better jell quick or were going to be hurting
7003654 any team expects their midfielder to control the game in the midfield
7003655 if you dont control the game from the midfield you dont win
7003656 so we expect a lot out of mr chambers to do that hes our most experienced and best player overall
7003657 we feel like nobody in the state can shut us down scoring goals
7003658 they know when to go near post when to go far post when to go down the middle when to overlap and they all three are skilled people who have played a lot of soccer
7003659 instead of those double and that we had before in the sectional we dont have them anymore
7003660 so now our sectional will be woodrow wilson greenbrier east us riverside and nicholas county
7003661 our expectations were set from day one when jeremy chambers stood up and said that we expected to be playing in the state championship this year
7003662 were good enough will some luck be involved yes some luck will be involved but were good enough
7003663 the linebackers defensive ends everybody played well especially in the second half
7003664 in the first half though we werent hitting on all cylinders offensively but we started to click in the second half but the defense played big the whole way
7003665 we had some new guys on the offensive line but they stepped right up and played just like we left off last year

7003682 this was data that was being held in a secure form but was downloaded on to a memory stick by an external contractor
7003683 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
7003684 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
7003685 we will have to see what other issues were present
7003686 clearly the breakdown was important enough for the pilot to halt the manoeuvre and have it reviewed
7003687 we can confirm the deaths of four british nationals in a road traffic accident on august 20
7003688 we are still seeking clarification about the accident from the south african authorities
7003689 we had a lot of complaints about the gassing of chicks from the germans this has gone all round the world and the one country that had a problem with it
7003690 i wanted to stand up and say hey after 65 years why do you need to bring that up it was a very unwise thing to say i was shocked

7003702 we play good football and its just about getting things right the speed we do things in the final third is where its going wrong at the moment
7003703 its a great chance for us to go there and play the way we can and hopefully get a result
7003704 it doesnt matter whether it is at pittodrie or ibrox when the two sides meet it is always a wonderful occasion and hopefully for the right reasons
7003705 it is always two teams that want to win football games but it is always a fair game we have had a good record against them in the past here and hopefully we can keep that going
7003706 rangers had a massive disappointment in lithuania a couple of weeks but im very impressed with how they have come back after what happened
7003707 on top of that it was a crushing blow for them to lose their best player and probably the best player in scotland for three months in barry ferguson but all credit to them as they have won two very difficult league games

7003740 oltre al fatto che la musica house deriva molto probabilmente dal connubio fra un trapano impazzito e un sub che affoga il truzzo possiede una carenza intellettiva del concetto di ego che gli impedisce totalmente di vivere pensare o agire autonomamente

7003750 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7003751 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7003752 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7003753 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7003754 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7003755 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7003756 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7003757 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7003758 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7003759 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7003760 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7003761 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7003762 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7003763 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7003764 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community

7003768 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7003769 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7003770 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7003771 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7003772 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7003773 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7003774 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7003775 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7003776 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7003777 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7003778 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest

7003795 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7003796 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs
7003797 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
7003798 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7003799 when you try to walk properly youre body is working two to three times harder than that of someone without this deformity
7003800 you probably walked on your toes because you learned it was a lot more comfortable to do so
7003801 how you walk isnt your fault david but everything else about how you live your life is
7003802 im looking for a guy whos generally unhappy lacks confidence and finds no fulfillment in what he does for a living
7003803 well if you look at me and where im at in my life should i allow myself to be ok with the point ive brought myself to
7003804 adams one of those really really tough guys you give him an inch and he is all over you
7003805 i was very pleased i could hear some shouts behind me then i was able to get into the rhythm and maintain that i was relatively relaxed
7003806 mountain biking is a very tough sport mentally so with age you can get stronger
7003807 ive worked very hard for this it is the work of many people
7003808 from 9 a m this morning the fighting has intensified with both sides using a lot of heavy guns including anti aircraft guns
7003809 my children and i took cover under our beds and we stayed for three hours till the situation subsided
7003810 there is a very harsh humanitarian crisis in the city
7003811 the fighting has displaced more than 5 500 people from the city
7003812 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7003813 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7003814 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7003815 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7003816 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7003817 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7003818 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7003819 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7003820 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7003821 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7003822 pet design has been developed to move web design beyond just efficiency and performance aligning it intimately with
7003823 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7003824 this is a planning took where all things are going
7003825 i think he says less than five words in the whole movie its all done with his facial expressions grunts and shrugs hes terrific he was playing one of those guys who works out all the time drinks protein shakes and isnt super bright
7003826 the joke is that she has become so disillusioned with hollywood that shes become a nurse in tucson it wasnt written specifically for her but other accomplished actresses didnt get the joke and didnt like the idea of laughing at themselves so they passed on it very quickly but shue loved it as soon as she read it
7003827 because she got it she played it so convincingly i do a scene where my character is so awestruck at meeting elisabeth at a fertility clinic im attending since my wife and i are so desperate to have a child what makes it so funny and so real is that elisabeth is so embarrassed that im such a crazy man such a nightmare fan but you totally buy the fact that she has really become this fertility clinic nurse
7003828 in the old days they just gave you a plaque
7003829 now chinese gold medalists walk away with more than many athletes in developed countries
7003830 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7003831 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7003832 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7003833 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7003834 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7003835 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7003836 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7003837 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7003838 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7003839 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7003840 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7003841 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7003842 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7003843 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7003844 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7003845 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7003846 chcia oby si powiedzie stare numery czy naprawd nie mo na znale jakiej sensownej metody by
7003847 enjoy whats happening hes a young guy enjoying himself its a great olympics just enjoy it the guy is a freak of nature hes putting on a show on the biggest stage
7003848 words cant explain four guys going out there believing in each other we wanted to show the world jamaica is a very special country teamwork having fun you cant ask for anything more
7003849 i come out here to perform and let people enjoy themselves the crowd loves it they look forward to seeing me come out doing it they pay good money to see great performances its my work i enjoy it its just me i wont change ill always be myself its my personality
7003850 weve been on the other side of that by the way
7003851 and its very painful those guys are proud competitors over there thats not fun for them
7003852 and they didnt hit a ball near the warning track all night long believe it or not to get that many runs youd think thered be four or five home runs
7003853 but theyre good hitters theyre hitting 280 as a team thats huge they put it in play and theres a lot to say about that put it in play and something good can happen
7003854 thats more than we should have expected as far as command
7003855 its hard to believe he could have been that sharp with that much time missed
7003856 i thought he threw the ball well and he had good stuff he threw a few sliders and he got enough curveballs over the plate it was a good first time back
7003857 it wasnt fantastic but it was something i could build on for sure we won the game im very happy to be back all the credit goes to the hitters anybody could have pitched today
7003858 that was a very good homecoming for me a welcome back present
7003859 theyll let me know as soon as possible if its something different
7003860 but i dont ever ever try to get into tonys head hes got a billion things going on and hes 300 or 400 times smarter than i am so i just sit on my chair and wait to hear from him
7003861 the braves had some bad luck tonight theres no doubt about it
7003862 heres a guy whos 3 0 in august and he didnt get the ball for the start thats pretty tough
7003863 at least 70 innocent civilians most of them women and children

7003865 die bewertungen der aktien haben zwar inzwischen relativ attraktive niveaus erreicht das makro konomische umfeld tr bt sich allerdings weiterhin ein
7003866 stabile trends gibt es derzeit nicht und auf einzelnachrichten wird je nach stimmungslage mit einem hin und herpendeln zwischen zwei extremszenarien reagiert
7003867 mir fehlt die phantasie warum das umfeld f r aktien besser werden sollte
7003868 ich glaube nicht dass wir die 6000er marke im dax in den n chsten zwei bis drei monaten halten k nnen
7003869 das einzige was aktien in n chster zeit treiben kann ist das thema inflation
7003870 der inflationsdruck geht wegen des gesunkenen lpreises zur ck aktien kann das allerdings nur kurzfristig unterst tzung geben
7003871 langfristig d rfte er sein rekordhoch von 147 wieder berbieten
7003872 der dollar geht voraus wird leicht st rker werden und den lpreis unter druck setzen
7003873 wobei der mittelfristige trend bedingt durch eine schwache weltkonjunktur nach wie vor nach unten gerichtet bleibt
7003874 has a real curiosity about the world who loves life and can find passion in lifes smallest moments
7003875 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man

7003878 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7003879 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7003880 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7003881 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7003882 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7003883 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7003884 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7003885 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7003886 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7003887 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7003888 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7003889 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7003890 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7003891 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7003892 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7003893 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7003894 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7003895 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7003896 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7003897 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7003898 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7003899 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7003900 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7003901 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7003902 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7003903 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7003904 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7003905 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7003906 we assumed that a was the cause of x we then found a way that a might have caused x we were happy with this explanation so we didnt consider hypothesis b which some other people had suggested
7003907 invad ing areas once immune to this kind of manipulation
7003908 numerous instances where the administration has manipulated the scientific process and distorted or suppressed scientific findings
7003909 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7003910 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7003911 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7003912 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7003913 he is a dual loyalist a foreign agent whose assignment is to get america committed to spilling the blood of her sons for client regimes who have made this moral mercenary a rich man
7003914 most important scheunemanns former lobbying firm orion strategies received at lest 800 000 from the government of georgia between 2004 and may 15 2008 when scheunemann finally severed his ties officially at least to the firm
7003915 before that between january 1 2007 and may 15 2008 scheunemann was officially on the payroll as both georgias lobbyist and mccains top adviser during which time georgia paid orion and 290 000 and mccain paid him 70 000
7003916 others who were once uneasy about the influence of conservatives on mr mccain say that their worries have not been realized even as mr mccain has taken conservative positions
7003917 this is the situation in which the interventionists have placed our country committed to go to war for countries and causes that do not justify war against a russia that is re emerging as a great power only to find nato squatting on her doorstep
7003918 t here doesnt seem to be any momentum either for a direct legal challenge or a congressional investigation which could subpoena the players and get sworn testimony
7003919 i have over 35 years of fire research in my experience i worked in the fire program at nist for 19 years leaving as a division chief i have been at the university of maryland since i am a founding member and past chair of the international association for fire safety science the principal world forum for fire research
7003920 in my opinion the wtc investigation by nist falls short of expectations by not definitively finding cause by not sufficiently linking recommendations of specificity to cause by not fully invoking all of their authority to seek facts in the investigation and by the guidance of government lawyers to deter rather than develop fact finding
7003921 i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable explained dr
7003922 i hope to convince you to perhaps become conspiracy theorists but in a proper way he said
7003923 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7003924 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7003925 there is also renewed technical selling and talk again of demand destruction the dollar is strong again too
7003926 i know that human rights were violated during the conflict
7003927 i am only here to look at the human rights situation and come up with recommendations on how these rights can be protected in the future our report will be objective and impartial
7003928 many people had their rights violated including the primary right to life to housing and so on and this issue requires much attention so weve come to find out what happened from that perspective
7003929 by september 1 the schools will definitely be open the first school has already been fixed and is ready two more schools will be ready on time as well
7003930 they bombed our homes luckily i had some buckets of water so i put out the fire the neighbours were gone and their houses burnt down they bombed several times see i have no ceiling now saakashvili is scary he is worse than hitler they say he is really insane i cannot understand why the georgian people obey him

7003941 i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7003942 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful
7003943 i looked around the internet for a few luxurious minutes and vastly enjoyed cranmers blog which i intend to read more regularly in future

7003945 i take advice in matters spiritual and religious from the ghost of archbishop cranmer his blog is a role model for niche blogs of all descriptions thoughtful erudite and provocative

7003951 dr thaksin has been really open he has said to us if you need me to resign from this football club because it will serve the needs of the premier league im fine with that he is embarrassed about the indignity he has brought upon his football club and the premier league he never intended this to be the case three months ago it was very different we are looking at taking him off the board as a director but can he be a shareholder those are two very different issues the jurisdiction around the term fit and proper person needs to be more clearly defined it is a very loose term almost tongue in cheek because there have been plenty of unfit and improper people in the league over the last 10 years
7003952 i want to be the best player in the world and that isnt possible at real madrid ive come to an end of a cycle ive played three seasons at real madrid ive scored goals ive won two leagues i have an offer which is good for me and the club i dream of playing in the english league i hope to resolve this situation as soon as possible its not about money i simply want to leave

7003962 i worked at a company nike where we were accused of child labour rights issues i managed to have a career there for 15 years and i believed we were innocent of most of the issues morally i felt confident in that environment morally i feel comfortable in this environment he has not skipped bail hes not gone back to face the charges he wants to be at this ground on sunday for the game with west ham but people may want to come and show their support from his country and he doesnt want to use this as a political platform and there has been a threat to his safety worldwide
7003963 the financial picture at city is far healthier than it appears from the outside despite a recent flurry of borrowing from the banks and from john wardle the former chairman thaksin recognises that he made mistakes last summer and is prepared to be realistic rather than ruthless with mark hughes the new manager even if no outside investment is forthcoming before the transfer window closes in nine days hughes has money to spend on new players
7003964 kompany is likely to feature as a defensive midfielder which may suggest that dietmar hamanns days at eastlands are numbered hughes is believed to be interested in recruiting the fluminese midfielder thiago neves who was part of brazils olympic squad neves 23 had the distinction of scoring a hat trick in the south american version of the champions league final the copa libertadores while still finishing on the losing side some might think this an excellent introduction to life at city
7003965 he was hugely impressive in his debut premier league campaign after moving to lancashire from bayern munich last summer scoring 23 goals in all competitions rovers gambled on the skilful paraguayan and paid bayern less than 4 million after a series of serious knee injuries wrecked his time in bavaria and the move paid off as santa cruz who scored in saturdays 3 2 win at everton played 36 of 38 premier league games last season
7003966 i hope im wrong but it looks as if roy keane is conducting a masterclass in kamikaze management el hadji diouf pascal chimbonda and now djibril cisse its hardly a recipe for dressing room harmony at sunderland given keanes personality is it its a recipe for trouble and it contradicts the values roy represented as a player these look to me like some of the riskiest signings ive seen in a while im amazed hes signed these guys its like throwing oil on a fire theres no doubting their talent but theyre the sort of players that can get you the sack the kind who will look great when the teams doing well but vanish in the heat of battle when a manager needs them most
7003967 is juande ramos one of the laziest foreign managers in the premier league as he moves towards his first anniversary at tottenham the spaniard is not even attempting to speak to the public in english luiz felipe scolari has been here five minutes and is charming chelsea fans in the local language after intensive lessons and while fabio capellos football might not make much sense his english is improving all the time perhaps the spurs manager doesnt think he will be around long enough for it to be worth knowing a new language after putting his neck on the line with top four ambitions this season
7003968 olympic sports recruit promote and drop talent as they see fit they are shamelessly elitist and single minded about success it is a level of control about which premier league academy directors can only dream somewhere along the way the premier league that bastion of greed and self interest lost sight of the notion of elitism in developing young players in england the best young footballers are stuck in the most crucial years of their development playing and training with 15 others their clubs have rounded up from the locality this parochial system means that clubs such as chelsea liverpool and arsenal are instead buying their young talent in from across the world at 17 players can sign professional forms and the academies of our great clubs are increasingly populated by foreign footballers buying such youngsters is cheaper than buying their english equivalents because fifa sets lower compensation tariffs
7003969 if united can persuade spurs to part company with berbatov ferguson thinks it will take some of the pressure off rooney at a time when louis saha has injury problems and cristiano ronaldo is still five or six weeks away from returning to the side despite being allowed to step up his training with some light jogging exercises
7003970 cristiano ronaldo has dealt manchester united a savage blow with the news he could be out until mid november ronaldo played with pain killing injections for the last three months of the season and through portugals euro 2008 campaign to delay any surgery but that made the initial problem worse and it now looks to have extended his rehabilitation period
7003971 i think its fair to say that i appreciate football and everything that comes with it maybe a bit more than some premier league players you get some who go straight into the premier league and dont know anything else but ive seen what its like in the other divisions too i came through the youth ranks at orient and the club was so skint one year we did an entire pre season on hackney marshes i dont think they could afford a cleaner so the young lads did it all we had to brush the stands paint the ground scrub the toilets get the mud out of everyones boots but i wouldnt change it for the world its completely different now and maybe some people have it a little too easy
7003972 ill never forget my first day straightaway i saw players i could work with they were technically gifted as good as id worked with at bolton after 15 minutes i stopped the session and said what the are you lot doing bottom of this division theyve proved me right as well the likes of andy dawson boaz myhill ryan france and ian ashbee the captain have now gone through all four divisions
7003973 when we decided to build the stadium i wanted to anticipate the possibility of financial restrictions so i concentrated on youth i also felt the best way to create an identity with the way we play football to get players integrated into our culture with our beliefs our values was to get them as young as possible and to develop them together i felt it would be an interesting experiment to see players grow together with these qualities and with a love for the club
7003974 it was an idealistic vision of the world of football
7003975 the daily telegraph has learned that triesman initially raised the issue at the fas summer meeting in torquay on the weekend of july 12 13 and acted only after a frank discussion with the board while barwick received only limited support from fa board members it was unlikely that they would oppose their powerful new independent chairman once he had raised the issue there are fears in the fa of further casualties as triesman modernises the association he is assembling the team to lead the bid for the 2018 world cup and it is understood he also clashed with barwick over who should fill key roles
7003976 it appears lord triesman never trusted the business acumen of his chief executive who in effect fell between two stools although well connected in football from his days as itvs controller of sport he had neither stellar commercial experience nor was he a respected former player able to play the role of statesmanlike figurehead in the way that franz beckenbauer does in germany
7003977 fortunately we had a reserve game on wednesday so i missed most of the first half of the england match unfortunately i saw all the second half it just seemed like extracting teeth if it had still been steve mcclaren in charge he would have got slaughtered theyd have been throwing their seats on i bet he was sat there in the netherlands saying thish ish not ze engleesh vay i vanted to play nothing seems to have changed we still dont know who is best in what position we still havent sorted the lampard and gerrard issue or worked out where to play rooney i havent seen rooney play a good game since euro 2004
7003978 do you really want to hear what is wrong with england or do you want to carry on blaming the manager and players until the hatred gets so vile everyone gives up and walks away the players are rubbish the players are paid too much the players dont care the players dont want to play for england any more then theres the manager barely in the job and already fabio capello doesnt know what hes doing has no new ideas is paid too much blah blah blah havent we heard all this before didnt i experience it first hand alongside steve mcclaren didnt sven goran eriksson kevin keegan glenn hoddle graham taylor all stand accused of the same incompetence was every single one really clueless and did every one of them really select the worst teams and tactics like everyone im sick of living off the memory of 1966 and want england to win so badly i twice put my head on the block to try to make it happen but the reaction to wednesday makes me wince
7003979 the problem is the lack of time devoted to our national side after wednesday night fabio capello should have been able to say to all his players get back in the hotel tomorrow and let us sort out whats going wrong he cannot do that because clubs rule until we learn from how teams in other sports are able to produce their very best when it counts we will never have an england team to be proud of we have to remember the state of english football is gauged by what happens with the national team until attention is paid to that things will never change
7003980 englands performance against the czechs was one of the worst i have seen things have not improved under fabio capello they have stayed the same our players do not have the technique required to cut it at the highest international level crossing balls from 35 40 yards out just isnt good enough we could pick a team of championship players who could do that
7003981 the best attack in europe undeniably belongs to the european champions manchester united with wayne rooney carlos tevez and ronaldo scoring more than 70 goals between them last season and can bayern munichs luca toni franck ribery miroslav klose and lukas podolski be discounted so easily lets not forget chelsea real madrid and barcelonas front lines either i mean lionel messi versus del piero theres sadly no contest

7004104 while its flattering to be compared to him initially it can be very detrimental to a young players career especially when youre 17 or that kind of age

7004142 theres going to be more charges its just a matter of getting things organized
7004143 when they went in they found 4 000 marijuana plants in various stages of growth
7004144 theres no safety issues for people living or working in the area
7004145 the victim was transported to an area hospital with no vital signs
7004146 were trying to determine what forensic evidence we can find at the scene
7004147 we received information that the shooter a male was seen running away from the scene in a westerly direction
7004148 i cant speak to whether or not this was a targeted incident
7004149 at this point the investigation is still in its infancy
7004150 it makes sense now why we smelled propane in the air all the time
7004151 it was so bad one time you had to go in the house
7004152 in one week they can check all these sites why didnt they do that before
7004153 what we see now is an incredible situation where the inspections are finally being done years after they should have been and miraculously we find theres a whole bunch of storage facilities across the province that theyve had to be closed down temporarily and in some cases permanently
7004154 it took an explosion to get them to wake up out of their slumber
7004155 will there be any more inspections again or will people go back to sleep and put people in danger across the province
7004156 i will be reviewing the results of the entire inspection process and taking appropriate next steps very soon in order to ensure any changes that need to be made in the interest of public safety are made
7004157 the comparison with zidane is one that is drawn with a lot of the youngsters who come from north african backgrounds
7004158 its quite often that these young kids are likened to him in some sort of way and hes definitely a fine role model to have
7004159 while its flattering to be compared to him initially it can be very detrimental to a young players career especially when youre 17 or that kind of age
7004160 it means people are expecting a lot from you and it can prove restrictive
7004161 we are having a meeting next wednesday about a lot of things and contracts will be one of the things discussed
7004162 there are other players to discuss as well im fairly relaxed about it but i will know more when we sit down
7004163 these things happen the main thing at the end of the day is that it will be sorted
7004164 vytorins effectiveness has been in doubt and now its safety is questionable
7004165 theres a body of medical literature that says those very plant sterols can inhibit the growth of cancer
7004166 real madrid would never want to retain a player against his wishes
7004167 i have never coached robinho but he is different and we need a player like that a player on the pitch who makes a difference
7004168 if we have only one system of play it will be easy for our opponents if we need to change the system we need a different player and robinhos style is what we want
7004169 barack obama has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7004170 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7004171 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7004172 el estado mayor no lleva las estad sticas de civiles muertos pero seg n estimaciones del ministerio del interior de osetia del sur en esta rep blica murieron durante el conflicto 2 100 personas

7004176 klar nachhilfe in den ferien ist schon nicht so toll
7004177 die sind in mathe und chemie nicht so weit wie wir
7004178 solche aufgaben kommen im pflichtteil im mathe abi dran und bringen viele punkte so etwas sollte sitzen
7004179 in der zw lften klasse z hlt jede klausur zum abitur
7004180 da kann man nicht das halbe jahr hinterherhinken und langsam wieder reinkommen
7004181 das bildungssystem ist wenig durchl ssig und stark vom elternhaus abh ngig
7004182 das hat sicherlich auch mit dem erh hten leistungsdruck im zuge der g 8 einf hrung zu tun
7004183 in manchen bundesl ndern wird dadurch mehr nachhilfe in anspruch genommen in anderen wiederum st hnen die sch ler dass sie nicht einmal daf r zeit haben
7004184 das n chste schuljahr f ngt schlie lich bald an und dann sollte katrin alles aufgeholt haben
7004185 sie ist einerseits sehr schnell und andererseits geht in der schule viel zeit mit nachfragen verloren
7004186 deshalb f llt es eltern oft schwer ihren kindern in der schule zu helfen
7004187 allein wenn jemand mathematik kann hei t das noch lange nicht dass er auch nachhilfe geben kann
7004188 nachhilfe kann gezielt auf den aufbau und den einsatz von lernstrategien wirken
7004189 im sorry if ive been pensive dear i was just reflecting on what a warm wonderful caring thoughtful intelligent beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy i am to have met you
7004190 dearest love in the event of your untimely demise life would cease to have meaning for me and i would of course hurl myself under the front tires of the first dominos pizza truck that came my way
7004191 and would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her
7004192 yes i think that would be the correct thing to do
7004193 at the moment the figures show up until august 22 and there is even more expected
7004194 the picture is very different in other places but for the time of year it has been very wet much more than expected
7004195 theres more rain expected today and at the start of next week there are suggestions there could be yet more hopefully things will settle down after that though
7004196 the area gets seeded in the spring then its almost immediately covered up again and stays covered for nearly the entire summer
7004197 the land is built on an old loch and with the increasingly poor weather much of the meadows has been turned into a swamp
7004198 i think its time the council took a look at the number of events its putting on
7004199 our members had no reluctance taking strike action we simply cant afford a 2 5 per cent rise and our members are in no mood to take this on the chin
7004200 we are pleased that cosla has approached us to re open talks on this years pay award following the successful strike by members of the three unions on wednesday
7004201 members made it very clear on wednesday that they want a settlement that protects them from inflation and does not lock them in to multi year awards the talks are welcome but are not in themselves a solution
7004202 we will be talking to our fellow unions to agree future action should it be required
7004203 our strategy is for a series of one day stoppages as well as selective action from groups of workers
7004204 theres a legal requirement to keep things moving so it would be within weeks but we will need to see what happens with these talks
7004205 it is very disappointing to learn that future action is already being considered this preempts the outcome of further discussions between cosla and the unions that are yet to take place
7004206 everyone is finding things hard during these difficult economic conditions but i do not believe industrial action is the answer
7004207 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
7004208 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
7004209 suddenly you find youre out there walking in a storm

7004211 allt som jag verkligen tycker om r antingen olagligt omoraliskt eller fettbildande
7004212 if people are worried they need to go and see their doctor and should not stop taking their pills
7004213 nobody should stop taking their cholesterol medication and if they have got any concerns they should certainly talk to their doctors
7004214 while they say they think there may be a link to more cases of cancer there is nothing to confirm it
7004215 most large prospective studies of statin drugs have reported no difference in cancer incidence
7004216 fda has determined that these findings in the seas trial plus interim data from ongoing trials should not prompt patients to stop taking vytorin or any other cholesterol lowering drug
7004217 we do not believe changes in the prescribing of vytorin are warranted
7004218 these results suggest that high consumption of coffee and tea may reduce the risk of cerebral infarction among men independent of known cardiovascular risk factors
7004219 the results are consistent with a growing body of evidence which has shown a link between tea consumption and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease
7004220 these beneficial effects of tea on reducing the risk of cerebral infarction are therefore biologically plausible
7004221 for some people food is where they find their comfort but it is not a long term solution
7004222 we have staff who are so overweight that they are afraid to go to the gym or play sports and the stupid thing is that the kids know it
7004223 this is a major issue for people of all ages
7004224 docs and local police are still looking to find the family
7004225 in relation to that matter that is a current order thats there before the courts from the department of community services so itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located

7004253 the interior ministry while expressing its profound regret because of this incident which happened by accident has sent a delegation of 10 people to the area and more details will be announced once the investigation is completed
7004254 19 women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
7004255 es muy dif cil pero siempre hay alg n porcentaje no s si del uno por ciento o cual pero hay posibilidades que tenemos que aprovechar lo que hizo argentina sirve para nosotros por la fuerza que dieron los jugadores no habituales aunque uno de los de siempre luis scola veintiocho puntos frente a los norteamericanos en semifinales estuvo fant stico
7004256 vamos a ver si damos la talla es dif cil despu s de la derrota que tuvimos con ellos pero en esa derrota estuvimos muy por debajo de nuestras posibilidades y estados unidos al cien por cien
7004257 estados unidos estaba pensando m s en la final que en argentina es lo que pas en la primera fase contra ellos que el equipo pensaba m s en los cuartos de final pero ste es el ltimo partido
7004258 ellos juegan a un ritmo muy alto y tiene una potencia tremenda eso hace dif cil jugar contra ellos porque dificulta el ataque frenarles la velocidad y el rebote de ataque es dif cil espero que los rbitros piten los pasos con los que cobran ventaja y las faltas pero si no lo hacen no es bice para que nosotros nos paremos
7004259 es muy importante saber que ellos defienden siempre y nosotros no podemos estar descansando en ataque cuando no tenemos el bal n hay que jugar sin bal n para que el jugador que lo tiene siempre tenga el recurso de poder pasar es un trabajo que hay que hacer siempre
7004260 depende como hagas la zona por ejemplo el argentino juan pedro guti rrez es un jugador complementario en granada pero pon a el cuerpo en la semifinal ante los estadounidenses y no pod an hacer mates
7004261 oberto que es un jugador m s contrastado pon a la mano y quitaba el cuerpo as que entraban a matar hay que poner el cuerpo pero no es f cil es muy importante ponerse
7004262 el momento de hacer el resumen de los juegos ser despu s del partido pero no cabe duda de que el baloncesto espa ol ha vuelto a triunfar en un campeonato internacional al ser algo tan repetido durante tantos a os quiere decir que hay un trabajo fenomenal tanto en la formaci n como en los clubes en la acb y en la federaci n y eso es un motivo de orgullo

7004350 these numbers are more realistic than what the street had been anticipating i dont think the buy side was expecting the third and fourth quarter to be positive the sell side analysts are just slow to catch up
7004351 most of this is related to the macroeconomic environment which has forced consumers to rein in their spending
7004352 its a bear market the other sectors are going to feel it in their profits too
7004353 i think a lot of the negative earnings revision you have are due to input costs that are causing margins to compress

7004444 peter burgoyne was someone people have been doubting for a fair time i thought he showed what he can do hes playing on ball against some pretty good players and he ripped them apart
7004445 he started on the bench he showed his willingness to run hard to tackle to win clearances hard ball gets kicked goals displayed all the want that he wants to be here next year
7004446 i think thats what our supporters our football staff and even our players were looking forward to him displaying
7004447 it was really poor really poor not competitive enough for long enough that would be in our top three or four really poor efforts for the whole year
7004448 they probably shouldve kicked more goals if their accuracy was better im sure the game wouldve blown out a lot further than it did port adelaide
7004449 that made it really clear to us all how important it is to finish races and to pick up good points
7004450 so much as i want to win in valencia i know the most important thing is to score well because the big picture is the championship and not just one race
7004451 it was a shame that we did not play our best game today but we won and that is the most important thing

7004460 it is a good course youve got to do a lot of good things
7004461 the greens are tough but i didnt think the scoring was going to be this low and when hunter goes out and shoots that nine under round yesterday it shows you that it is capable and it is out there
7004462 especially thursday morning to friday afternoon its a different golf course the greens are definitely bouncy and firmer and definitely played tougher
7004463 the golf course certainly in the last nine holes was very crispy greens especially
7004464 the sixth green was toasty i mean its glazed and very difficult to get the ball rolling consistently on those greens
7004465 but its the same for everybody i found the golf course yesterday morning was perfect and steve stricker has obviously found the same sort of set up the afternoon is a different kettle of fish its tricky

7004481 we are excited to have a distributor with years of experience and a customer service philosophy to match our own
7004482 we often get sent links to images from our customers asking for actions to reproduce a certain style and the kidz set is a response to these requests
7004483 we have changed our approach slightly with this releases as the actions offer a modular approach whereby the user runs the base action and then adds and modifies effects as required
7004484 the actions included color and contrast boosts as well as bw conversions tints and tones and vignettes we feel that this approach offers the right balance between ease of use and versatility
7004485 we are always keen to receive feedback from both existing and potential customers and we have added short questionnaire so that visitors to the site can express their views

7004490 we discussed the core issue and it is not proper now to divulge what we discussed in the meeting
7004491 we discussed and exchanged views in a cordial atmosphere and agreed to meet again
7004492 we are going now to attend the samitis meeting to consult them further on the issue most probably we will reach some decision in a day or two

7004497 its a big week for us three games in a week before the international break charlton are going to be there or thereabouts in this division at the end of the season so thats a good yard stick
7004498 and then crystal palace neil warnock came in they had a great run and ended up in the play off positions so healthy respect from me for crystal palace
7004499 they had an indifferent start at home to preston which was strange then they won in the cup against orient and it looked like they murdered burnley
7004500 ive just watched the game they didnt really but nevertheless a 3 0 win away from home is a great victory
7004501 weve got to hold the ball up weve got to win balls weve got to win headers
7004502 its a tough job but its your job and were going to do it this week against swansea
7004503 it should be good to see them his former swansea team mates but come the game theres no friends on the field
7004504 last year what a phenomenal run they had and their players caught the eye
7004505 particularly their skipper brian howard hes going to be a guy that we have to make sure we try and keep quiet hes a good player and good players make things happen on their own
7004506 and theyve got the experience of big darren moore at the back if were looking to win this game we have to make sure their best players are not playing well

7004509 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7004510 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7004511 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7004512 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7004513 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7004514 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7004515 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7004527 the aircraft had landed at dublin airport but it could have originated anywhere within the ryanair network it was obviously in the aircraft beforehand
7004528 a passenger found the cartridge in an overhead cabin when they were putting up their luggage
7004529 it is a matter for the airline to deal with now
7004530 dublin airport authority will not be launching an investigation into this incident
7004531 i heard four pops like fire crackers and the next minute i heard screaming and looked up to see an old white car racing away from the scene
7004532 a man was lying on the floor of the terrace outside the bar and writhing around in agony with blood coming from his shoulder as the first of the police cars turned up
7004533 very serious repercussions for the entire equine industry in our country
7004534 unless these people get their act together they have a very serious problem
7004535 i was asked before beijing what my wish for these games was and i answered that it would be ireland going through the three weeks without being tainted by any hint of doping i am sick and tired of our name being dragged through the mud like this
7004536 we need to work every hour of every day now to restore confidence in the sport leaving it out of the olympics is not the answer
7004537 other sports have done it and now we need to i could understand how peoples confidence would be shaken
7004538 within three quarters of an hour of landing in hong kong word came through that there had been a positive test for an irish horse
7004539 we have no choice because testing is monitored by the individual bodies neither ourselves nor the irish sports council have any responsibility whatsoever for testing equestrian sports
7004540 the subject is so complex its beyond our expertise but we are now launching our own investigation into this case with horse sport ireland
7004541 we utterly refute the suggestion we didnt report it properly as we did
7004542 ill say yes to that idea but not because it is already running or anything im just saying yes because its possible i think it is possible sorry to say we dont have specific plans at the moment but it is possible yes
7004543 the result is a disgrace there were four chinese judges and they gave everything to their fighter and nothing to paddy i am pure raging
7004544 his effort was second to none and he scored points which werent awarded to him
7004545 he will overcome this and be back stronger hes got the mentality to go on to better things
7004546 words cant describe how proud of him i am but the way the fight was scored was disgusting and hard to watch
7004547 he was fighting one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world and he had a great chance
7004548 if he had got off to a better start things may have been different
7004549 it is a real shame he didnt score i thought there were at least four or five points which he should have got but he is coming home with the bronze medal and he has done ireland proud
7004550 he is still our hero and we want to get him home there is a big party waiting for him
7004551 being in beijing was amazing the support for paddy was incredible
7004552 it was hard to see him so emotional after the fight but everyone saw that he did not stop he did not tire and he did not give up
7004553 i am disappointed that he didnt score but we are very pleased with the bronze
7004554 by the end of the fight he was going for the knock out because thats all he could hope for he showed the guts he has
7004555 paddy has competed in the biggest and the best sporting event in the world now it is all about london in 2012
7004556 to get to the semi final of the olympics is a great achievement i thought he would have got to the final but the judges seemed slightly biased towards his opponent
7004557 it was hard to see him fight and watch no points go up on the board but he will come back stronger from the experience
7004558 he did well because he was fighting a champion boxer
7004559 i know nothing about boxing but i thought he should have had a few points he worked very hard these last years to get where he is
7004560 hell be on the phone later today and ill tell him how proud i am of him
7004561 its so good to see you son i missed you so much
7004562 youre already quite the young man i love you very much zach
7004563 i hope my marriage is still that passionate after twelve years
7004564 we are having to amend the legislation because you can get to a lot of places and back in three days we are playing catch up to close that loophole and it is a concern that it is there work is already in place to change the law so that the three day window is closed
7004565 at the moment we can place foreign travel orders on convicted sex offenders which stop them going abroad once on the sex offenders register but they have to be applied for through the magistrates courts and only last six months
7004566 we plan to extend that period and to introduce the immediate removal of an offenders passport these things are going to come in but they are not in place at the moment we hope they will be introduced as soon as possible
7004567 falls far far below what is acceptable for western european standards of justice
7004568 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted
7004569 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety
7004570 these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his well being im pleased to say thats in place
7004571 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason he is pleased to be back because for the first time he can appear before a court of justice he tells me that his trial in vietnam was a charade was a travesty of justice
7004572 i came in and there were police officers outside they handed me a leaflet saying dont be worried theyre just looking into the neighbourhood there have been three terror arrests
7004573 it was quite hard to see which houses because there were crowds of people outside and two police cars and a van its really worrying that its so close you cant believe its actually happening on your street in your community
7004574 you dont expect it on your doorstep but thats life it could happen anywhere
7004575 they were a law abiding family theyve never been in any trouble whatsoever theyre normal everyday lads

7004582 turn out to be winners although hes no bargain because he was already considered the best in the world
7004583 chances are good that if hed done only slightly worse they might not really be getting their moneys worth because im sure they were cutting deals based on his potential
7004584 public figures like michael phelps exert a major influence over our youngsters
7004585 ciof believes that celebrities should think twice before choosing to endorse or encourage the consumption of any product which is inherently unhealthful sic to children especially if that product is correlated to obesity diabetes and a myriad of dangerous conditions
7004586 michael embodies the values behind our frosted flakes earn your stripes programme

7004588 it now appears that an effort may be underway to depose georgias duly elected government russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

7004636 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7004637 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7004638 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7004639 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7004640 we know for certain that narragansett bay is warmer on average and at the extremes than at any other time in recorded history
7004641 over the past 30 years the average mean temperature of the bay has gone up two degrees fahrenheit the average winter temperature has increased four degrees
7004642 warmer temperatures have caused dramatic changes at many levels and most have a distinctly negative environmental and economic impact
7004643 the bays animal and plant communities are fundamentally shifting critical habitats are threatened environmental quality and even public health and human life and property are jeopardized
7004644 they are nervous about the changes necessary as we move to a green economy
7004645 we are not responding as a society to this threat as rapidly as we should
7004646 that is coming on us with very very serious and broad implications it looks like its worse than people thought and the timeline for action is more urgent than many believe
7004647 and the rate at which it is occurring is unprecedented the natural response is outpacing our ability to predict the change which place all of us at a disadvantage that will have dire consequences unless we act quickly
7004648 it is unequivocal that climate change is happening and human conduct is the cause
7004649 narragansett bay is already seeing the effects of climate change sea level rise will occur but we must monitor this closely because both the timing and magnitude are still uncertain water temperatures will continue to increase and impact the coastal and bay ecosystems hurricane and tropical storm trends have the potential to inflict great damage and coupled with increased sea level we should be taking a precautionary approach so that coastal communities become resilient to the possible impacts
7004650 react more strongly to climate change if it had a face was considered immoral and was understood as a present danger with local impact
7004651 i really believed that my congressional colleagues on the committee would experience the same epiphany i had when they heard this great scientists clear analysis i couldnt have been more wrong the urgency simply didnt come across id seriously underestimated the resistance and disinterest this alarming prognosis of global warming would meet
7004652 making a global problem a local one people can see the specifics of how climate change affects their local economy and their local ecosystems
7004653 this is about shifting the power back to the people

7004671 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7004672 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7004673 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7004674 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7004675 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7004676 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7004677 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7004678 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7004679 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7004680 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7004681 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7004682 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7004683 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7004684 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7004685 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7004686 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7004687 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7004688 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7004689 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7004690 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7004691 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7004692 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7004693 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7004694 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7004695 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7004696 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7004697 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7004698 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7004699 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7004700 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7004701 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7004702 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7004703 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7004704 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7004705 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7004706 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7004707 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes

7004716 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7004717 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7004718 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7004719 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7004720 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7004721 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7004722 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7004723 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7004724 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7004725 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7004726 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7004727 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7004728 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
7004729 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7004730 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands

7004734 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7004735 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7004736 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7004737 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7004738 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7004739 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7004740 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7004741 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7004742 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7004743 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7004744 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7004745 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7004746 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7004747 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7004748 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7004749 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7004750 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7004751 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7004752 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7004753 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7004754 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7004755 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7004756 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7004757 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7004758 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7004759 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7004760 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
7004761 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
7004762 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7004763 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7004764 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7004765 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
7004766 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
7004767 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
7004768 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
7004769 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
7004770 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7004771 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7004772 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7004773 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7004774 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7004775 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7004776 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7004777 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7004778 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7004779 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7004780 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7004781 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7004782 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7004783 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7004784 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7004785 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7004786 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7004787 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7004788 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7004789 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7004790 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7004791 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7004792 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7004793 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7004794 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7004795 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7004796 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7004797 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7004798 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7004799 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7004800 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7004801 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7004802 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7004803 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7004804 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7004805 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7004806 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
7004807 they told me there are going to be resources here
7004808 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
7004809 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
7004810 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
7004811 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
7004812 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
7004813 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
7004814 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
7004815 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
7004816 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7004817 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7004818 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
7004819 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure

7004834 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7004835 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7004836 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7004837 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7004838 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7004839 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7004840 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7004841 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7004842 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7004843 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

7004847 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
7004848 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7004849 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7004850 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7004851 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7004852 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7004853 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7004854 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7004855 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7004856 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off

7004860 we put in a massive effort to contain this fire because we didnt want to lose houses
7004861 at one point we had two 802 airtractors two helicopters 17 grassfire units and four or five other appliances to control the fire
7004862 we managed to get the fire under control by around noon sunday
7004863 the malicious acts of arsonists put the lives of a great number of people at risk
7004864 landholders need to be reminded that they are responsible for taking measures to reduce the risk of bushfire and ensuring they have fire breaks

7004897 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7004898 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7004899 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7004900 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7004901 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7004902 it was a dream game all i could think of was thank god the ball went over the line and now thanks to that i have a gold medal
7004903 we didnt play our best football today but this victory is a good one for us
7004904 the fact that we have been to the athletes village and met famous sportsmen its all an experience that we will not forget quickly
7004905 messi terrorises not only our team but all teams in europe he didnt score but he created a lot of their chances that is why we have the silver and they have the gold
7004906 were very disappointed but it means we came second in the olympic games we had a lot of good scoring chances but you have to score goals to win the gold medal
7004907 im not a lover at all of international friendlies especially in august i personally dont think theyre necessary
7004908 sammy clingan got carried off playing for northern ireland and is very doubtful

7004910 my goal was to get it as clean as it was before the europeans came here
7004911 the florida report analyzed 168 900 deaths statewide cocaine heroin and all methamphetamines caused 989 deaths it found while legal opioids strong painkillers in brand name drugs like oxycontin caused 2 328 drugs with benzodiazepine mainly depressants like xanax led to 743 deaths alcohol was the most commonly occurring drug appearing in the bodies of 4 179 of the dead and judged the cause of death of 466 fewer than cocaine 843 but more than methamphetamine 25 and marijuana 0 the study also found that while the number of people who died with heroin in their bodies increased 14 percent in 2007 to 110 deaths related to the opioid oxycodone increased 36 percent to 1 253
7004912 florida scrutinizes drug related deaths more closely than do other states and so there is little basis for comparison with them

7004919 but even for him this recent gaffe is clearly over the top
7004920 ive had a great relationship with indian americans in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7004921 up until now in my state weve had a strong indian community made up of leading scientists and researchers and engineers but lately
7004922 if i see someone who comes in thats got a diaper on his head and a fan belt wrapped around the diaper on his head that guy needs to be pulled over

7004925 i was never anorexic so i was never that skinny i was never bony bony but i remember thinking
7004926 you go to a show and there s no food at all so if you
7004927 but i have to be realistic and face the possibility that i might not live to see them grow up
7004928 call me a racist call me a bigot a chav whatever but don
7004929 when i was first told how serious my cancer was my first thought was for my boys
7004930 how on earth can i explain this to my babies
7004931 then when i was told i needed an urgent hysterectomy i broke down at the thought of never having more children i have always longed for a baby girl
7004932 then it hit me that some women get cancer and will never become mums i realised i should be so thankful for my gorgeous sons and decided i was going to take this horrible disease on and win
7004933 since big brother my life has been fashioned by publicity but no way would i want anyone to be in my shoes now i have to try and brush that sort of stuff aside and concentrate on living and getting well again
7004934 dat is het bewijs dat die eerste op maat hypotheek niet deugde
7004935 more than 85 million households in india spend 30 billion hours gathering firewood the country also consumes 131 tonnes of crude oil products in 2007 08
7004936 the country has a coal reserve for next 50 years and after that well run out of coal in india most of the power generating stations are coal based and the only way out is to generate nuclear energy through developing our existing resources
7004937 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011

7004948 pasta salad has come along way from mayonnaise and celery
7004949 i see that someone has read too much of my works is it not
7004950 you did a good job of imitating my style but not good enough i could see traces of me all over your posts though
7004951 what matters is i could teach you how about that i could teach you how to make it better and different from my writing
7004952 i will truly miss the girls but this has been a vision of mine for the last seven years and its finally going to the big screen
7004953 imagine a rock n roll version of cirque du soleil which is a musically driven theatre show with speciality acts comprised of incredible talent
7004954 since china aspires to be a nation that places emphasis on its people we shall now see how it is going to solve its problems from the perspective of humanity and accept the differences among its 56 ethnic groups
7004955 marriage will be recognised in the tax system if i am davids chancellor which i fully expect to be then i will implement that there is no disagreement there at all
7004956 of course everyone is entitled to choose how to live their lives and some marriages do fail but we know that in general marriage is an institution that contributes to building a stronger society
7004957 that is why labour was wrong to stop supporting it through the tax system and that is why we will recognise it
7004958 if youre running a race and youre ahead you dont have to keep looking over your shoulder
7004959 they had lots of guns including a revolver and an ak 47
7004960 they know it aggravates us so they stick gaffs in them and drag them around
7004961 they dont target sharks on a daily basis but they have to make a living
7004962 unfortunately there are sensitive people out there but a living has to be made
7004963 naturally divers get upset when after enjoying a passive interaction with sharks they see a boat full of dead sharks at the same slipway they launch from
7004964 this is not good business for the eco tourism industry
7004965 at the same time we cannot wait years for the results of the research as there will be hardly any sharks left by then
7004966 we therefore urge a precautionary approach applied to shark fisheries where data is lacking
7004967 it hasnt even been discussed at an executive level only if santana requests parreiras return would we consider it
7004968 it would be like peter de villiers being told jake white was coming back to help him
7004969 santana has just been back to brazil for four weeks i am sure he talked to carlos then
7004970 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
7004971 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7004972 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults

7004977 the 70cl bottles are not genuine and while branded as spar they are based on a pre 2007 label design
7004978 inspection of the label shows that the duty stamp is incorrect and does not fluoresce under uv light while the body of the text is blurred in places particularly around the back of the label while some of the images are also blurred
7004979 the actual bottles are also different from the normal spar imperial bottles the counterfeits are quinn glass and have the code of qi 1445c and a smudged inkjet code which looks like 102234 04 08 02

7004981 scientists are going ape after saying they have found the best evidence to date that the yeti does exist

7004987 today institutions fundamental to the british system of government are under attack the public schools the house of lords the church of england the holy institution of marriage even our magnificent police force are no longer safe from those who would undermine our society and its about time we said enough is enough and saw a return to the traditional british values of discipline obedience morality and freedom
7004988 barack obama has decided upon a vice presidential running mate and while i don t know who it is as i write for the good of the country i hope he picked joe biden
7004989 ok the disc is 12cm ill use that to figure out the size of the front of the system and then rescale the patent drawings to match what i find and use those measurements to make my models
7004990 nikhil youre here amidst a bevy of apparently hot chicks and over fed rich men and youre wearing a dirty white shirt with sweat stains on the sleeves a pair of trousers that are frayed around every corner and some weirdly horrifying pair of floaters whatre you missing

7004992 inzwischen haben bereits drei banken unseren fonds auf ihrer empfehlungsliste und drei weitere banken ihn in ihre standardverm gensverwaltung bernommen
7004993 zwei unabh ngige experten bestimmen regelm ig den wert unseres portfolios
7004994 die probe aufs exempel besteht darin dass ein werk verkauft wird auch das kam bereits vor mit deutlichem gewinn
7004995 der fotografiemarkt ist wie jeder kunstmarkt sehr intransparent f r ein vergleichbares werk kann in kurzem zeitabstand auf einer auktion das mehrfache oder ein bruchteil erzielt werden
7004996 zudem findet ein gro teil des handels nicht auf auktionen sondern in galerien und anderswo statt f r die meisten transaktionen bleiben die preise also im dunkeln
7004997 zumindest bis die institute ihre ergebnisse zum dritten quartal vorlegen was aber erst mitte oktober sein wird
7004998 die bewertungen der aktien haben zwar inzwischen relativ attraktive niveaus erreicht das makro konomische umfeld tr bt sich allerdings weiterhin ein
7004999 das motto f r die n chste woche lautet vorsichtig bleiben und trotzdem zusehen wo sich chancen bieten
7005000 stabile trends gibt es derzeit nicht und auf einzelnachrichten wird je nach stimmungslage mit einem hin und herpendeln zwischen zwei extremszenarien reagiert
7005001 mir fehlt die phantasie warum das umfeld f r aktien besser werden sollte
7005002 ich glaube nicht dass wir die 6000er marke im dax in den n chsten zwei bis drei monaten halten k nnen
7005003 das einzige was aktien in n chster zeit treiben kann ist das thema inflation
7005004 der inflationsdruck geht wegen des gesunkenen lpreises zur ck aktien kann das allerdings nur kurzfristig unterst tzung geben
7005005 langfristig d rfte der lpreis seine st tzende wirkung f r die aktienm rkte verlieren derzeit erlebe der rohstoffmarkt eine stabilisierungsphase sagt merz bei 110 bis 120 pro barrel scheine der lpreis seinen boden gefunden zu haben langfristig d rfte er sein rekordhoch von 147 wieder berbieten
7005006 der dollar geht voraus wird leicht st rker werden und den lpreis unter druck setzen
7005007 wobei der mittelfristige trend bedingt durch eine schwache weltkonjunktur nach wie vor nach unten gerichtet bleibt
7005008 die investoren warten auf ein positives zeichen von finanzminister henry paulson
7005009 das letzte was wir jetzt brauchen sind eingeschr nkt funktionierende hypothekenfinanzierer deshalb rechnen wir damit dass paulson die m rkte beruhigen wird
7005010 denkbar w ren eine kapitalerh hung oder eine strategische fusion
7005011 die us wirtschaft bleibt weiter schwach die zinsen niedrig und das finanzsystem birgt weiterhin gro e risiken
7005012 kaisa mehsoos ho raha hai apko how are you feeling now
7005013 this is something we are talking to wayne about and he himself has started to identify that its a weakness it is not a bad thing for him to have come out after englands 2 2 draw against the czech republic and said so he is realising he needs to be more around the edge of the box in the last third of play it can be a waste of energy chasing from man to man to man but thats his natural enthusiasm and you cant fault that
7005014 eleven days under pressure we are working at something but you never know in football we may get him we may not were trying but if we dont we will carry on with what we have got if you take the long term view i think we would be ok
7005015 unselfishness is not the biggest crime to have in your life as a footballer
7005016 it shows qualities of team ethic and that is terrific to see in this era of need to be seen just look how some players celebrate goals the earrings they wear and the tattoos they have it tells you the age we are in it is refreshing that someone is prepared to sacrifice for the team effort its only a small correction he has to make

7005020 50 50 chance of a ps3 version of left 4 dead coming out dont expect to see it any time soon whatever happens
7005021 its something thats being talked about right now as the game is gaining popularity and looking like its going to be a hit
7005022 er is niemand kritischer voor het gebrek aan ervaring van barack obama dan joe biden
7005023 biden heeft al kritiek geuit op de zwakte van obama inzake buitenlandse politiek en hij heeft met zijn eigen woorden gezegd wat de amerikanen zich nu meer en meer beginnen te realiseren barack obama is niet klaar om president te worden

7005032 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7005033 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honour our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7005034 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7005035 we cannot subject our members to the laws of the government
7005036 good faith to try to stop the conflict from escalating
7005037 the law of the republic of the philippines should prevail and it will be under the law that we will prosecute them and judge them

7005039 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
7005040 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
7005041 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7005042 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7005043 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7005044 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement

7005109 it was not my choice neither was i dull but the government policy was not in favour of my desire
7005110 i had failed to come to terms with life it was so unfair having had to look after these children struggle to feed and meet their demands and forget all about my own education i did not know that god was always by my side and that i would one day find myself in a classroom
7005111 i dont want to look a destitute before the people who killed my parents of course that is what they wished for us
7005112 i would take them into other healing programs but on return a few days later i would find them discussing about their dead parents and relatives

7005114 new you how about a new look from january through the end of febrauary its
7005115 thats what i said what is it a new isagenix product which is
7005116 officially you can continue taking propecia while trying to conceive a child from the official propecia coms
7005117 contact with the semen from a man being treated with propecia is not a risk to the unborn child of a pregnant woman
7005118 however some doctors and patients are still cautious about using propecia when trying to conceive because of this some doctors recommend you temporarily stop taking the medication during the fertile period when you are trying to conceive with your partner and best to stop for only a week when your wife is fertile you can also stop taking propecia for two weeks and i doubt it will have any significant negative impact on hair
7005119 were looking at colors that are almost into the browns and raisins

7005166 hes a solid race car driver i like his attitude hes just got the right attitude when it comes to racing hes a racer
7005167 ive always loved this place always ran good here and although we struggled in qualifying it really didnt matter the car was just so good in the race
7005168 then we got some help with clint i dont exactly know what happened to him there but i felt like if i put a little bit of pressure on him i might catch a break and it seems to be what might have happened there

7005170 that last set of tyres we were struggling with tightness and it was making it difficult
7005171 and then the 22 car canadian andrew ranger he was racing me like it was for the win and he was a lap down absolutely gave me no room whatsoever and that really hurt us

7005184 cells are affected by cells around them if you make a change to a cell the perturbation travels to nearby cells the real power of gis comes in predictive modeling what would happen if you were to build a freeway somewhere we know freeways produce certain types of sprawls developments and population density so you can predict the land use five to 10 years down the road in the area
7005185 is that it takes all the data feeds from the sewer water and other municipal agencies and brings it into a modeling environment so if i put several houses in an area i fill out a form that specifies 2 5 people per unit theres a formula in the system that calculates how much additional water will be used how much car and foot traffic it would create and will show me in bar charts so this allows you to run what if scenarios

7005276 no thats an illusion the pain is long ago and past it sits as vonnegut said about his fathers rifles they rust
7005277 im not comfortable with that panic sadness breakdown give it back
7005278 matthew said during the week that yoga is whatever youre experiencing right now
7005279 i once read a bit on a blog about the path to backbending being essentially self acceptance and affirmation no matter how much it sucks to do that
7005280 per another blog bhakti has a dark side it is not just all about goodness and light
7005281 lower the back knee lunge the front one forward put the hand down then come up on back foot
7005282 currently my hosts seem not to be home so im writing this while seated on the back of the car
7005283 i still have substantial road spaciness its hard to remember sights seen i know that in my shorts and somewhat ragged necked t shirt and big black hat and hematite necklace that i feel very austin texas this neighborhood while on some front lawns very anti war and pro obama is so nice bicyclists sailing easily up and down the lanes people saying hello in the street to strangers no crime no trace of povertys iron fistedness that it makes me feel like i must be glowing with bohemian incandescence
7005284 i do but with heels up and its new and still kind of hit and miss
7005285 today after the adjustment clinic i felt a huge depression settling in and it was really intense for about 90 minutes depression and climbing actually always makes me crave booze in both cases while here i have refused post climbing booze is just celebratory habit but depression and booze is wanting to make the pain stop ive decided to sit with it i know now 3 hours later that its about leaving the end of vacation the return to work and debt and a lonely house for a week there is no doubt about this i could go on at length about the circumstances but dont want to they are on tap every day that i live in indianapolis and so readily available
7005286 a few days ago sunday actually i missed a turn and in fixing it found a movie theater
7005287 marichyasana adjustments a new bit for me was to ground the buttocks not just here but in all forward bends
7005288 ed back to thoughts on kapo this morning i forgot to put more of my face on the floor to develop the back arch
7005289 i am primed for some serious meditation right now its 8 30 pm local and im nicely beat nothing like yesterdays insane exhaustion
7005290 then up to backbending ms asked me if id done kapo on my own and i hadnt so try it on your own 2 or 3 times
7005291 post practice while i processed this i realized that i have learned important things i can take my toes i can press up from back there bye supta virasana i have directions avenues methods ed note for the record that karen and i both have exactly this high praise for the week
7005292 dropbacks i have been intently body listening to every day of these todays adjustment was to move the hips slightly forward on the way down and to press the feet via the hips down on the way up that is forward for down down for up four as usual easier i could feel the hip flexors really deliciously give me the drop with just a little stabilizing support from ms these i liked backed off the depression right away just now i realized that i spaced sirsasana in this practice eeek
7005293 when i saw gonzo i also saw a trailer for a new coen brothers thing burn after reading clooney mcdormand and brad pitt in something of a reprise of his stoner character in true romance looks like good absurd eccentric coen fun
7005294 ms had less contact in the dropbacks today and i could really feel the hip flexors let it go
7005295 ah before i forget music sunday to class morrison motel doors 1970
7005296 michelle who runs the show is very lively and pregnant and is good energy
7005297 intermediate we did progressive mula bandha exercises and then 2nd series from 4 as 3 bs to eka pada sirsasana no forward fold
7005298 i learned to point the feet in dhanurasana and also to point the tucked foot in ardha matsyendrasana
7005299 nighttime recovery of the afternoon it was indeed head and handstands ms was quite silly with us at times as most workshops eventually get example i dont want to see any full handstands yet dont make me come over there and spank your bum knees together when you come up into down from an inversion puts more effort into the center line and builds strength knees apart when you come up or go down gives greater flexibility but reduces stability i learned how to hold what is essentially a handstand planche tuck up thighs to chest and hold shoulders back armpits open the shoulders back gives the stability to hold that position ed this is also what you see matthew doing in his posters say when he jumps back from bakasana he jumps up first into this position handstand in full expression also means transitions in and out say to and from urdhva dhanurasana it is not a single inversion by itself it is a process you learn how to get stable in inversions by coming down with control that builds going up with control and alright alright alright i asked ms about this persistent hip flexor pain i get from backbending work and he said well actually that sounds like good news to me which is exactly what all the other backbend saavy yogis ive asked have said rats hah
7005300 i dont know that you can teach yourself this but try this out
7005301 yesterday afternoon ed by which i mean wednesday dans buddies neil and mark came over and we took koan who again is six outside so as not to disturb dans interview with uptight catsitters ed the cast of characters is this dan is the father of the house where i stayed koan is his son jess who is the person id actually met when i arranged this mn stay was in mexico for the week so it was the three guys getting to know each other all week and it was really pretty cool
7005302 i crashed early if pre 10pm is early and slept a solid 8 hours the alarm woke me up
7005303 i gave up on left side pasasana but right side was easy
7005304 the pose broke something in my resistance today full minutes of ragged breathing quiet laughter emotional energy cascading down waterfalling
7005305 i did a few shallow half bends because there was no wall room and got instant warnings from the low back and hip flexors fear
7005306 then ms had me do this hips forward arch slow extend arms hold come up up on toes and see about balancing then back two of those we wound up doing three once i kerplunked back but to hands not head which technically makes it my most successful dropback ever once i kerplunked forward to standing then again back the third time the motion possible there is drastic but fun ive never felt like a stereotypical flexy backbender but this move sure took me to slinkytown ill tell you that then a nice solid closing ahhh
7005307 then backbends go gently thatll be sensitive were matthews words
7005308 karen and i went for some serious circumlocution trying to find a restaurant that was it turned out closed but we wound up with tasty breakfast anyway
7005309 i got to setu bandhasana asked ms what shall i do now
7005310 early on matthew recommended in surya b that i move my arms slightly forward in utkatasana shoulders were out of line with neck and center and also that i jump back to plank rather than to chaturanga ed the reason for this is in his 5 sequences book where he links the jumps in surya to the jumps through and back and thence to handstand
7005311 it is now tuesday morning just post practice and i am at the now open zumbro about to eat what looks like very tasty breakfast
7005312 when i got back to town ed now completely spaced and dehydrated from the exertion of the morning practice and the also very sweaty climbing adventure i bought a veggie sub provolone sprouts avocado tomato cucumber tasty enough and went home spaced out to the core

7005322 sinto dificuldades principalmente noite em que mais dif cil identificar um foco de inc ndio sobretudo na zona urbana porque existem muitas luzes
7005323 tivemos muitas situa es dessas na mealhada cheg mos conclus o que era sempre quando um restaurante ia assar os leit es depois j sab amos quando se via fumo quela hora era o leit o a ir para o forno

7005330 muitos dos vigilantes socorrem se do telem vel em situa es limite e ligam para o 117 ou porque o r dio naquele dia n o est a funcionar bem ou porque n o se conseguem fazer ouvir na sala de detec o
7005331 ao darem alerta pelo 117 automaticamente o sistema assume como uma chamada de um popular e n o como de um posto de vigia
7005332 v em se o fumo est a ficar mais intenso mais branco ou mais negro mais para a direita ou mais para a esquerda como analisam dist ncia mais f cil fazer uma avalia o e todos estes dados s o muito importantes para o comandante das opera es no terreno

7005362 when the officer told me i couldnt leave i packed up my camera gear sat in my car and waited for cpl tom robison
7005363 the question is would people prefer to have that money go to the classroom or see the byelections pro ceed
7005364 we want to hear what people think about that one
7005365 by announcing these changes in the middle of the summer and giving people just three weeks to comment the conservatives appear to be making a half hearted attempt at public consultation
7005366 the opposition parties will have their chance to have a kick at law amendments
7005367 as we have clearly seen in two recent cases boards can sometimes lose their focus become mired in bickering and lose their effectiveness as well as their respect for one another and the public
7005368 im just focusing now on getting my fitness levels back up to 100 per cent
7005369 after that we will see what players the manager brings in during the transfer market and what my role in the team could be
7005370 but this will be my second season at liverpool and hopefully i can take my game to the next level
7005371 we have a lot of exciting attacking players we know we can hurt teams when we attack but we also need to get it right defensively
7005372 its difficult to know where teams will end up this season but we have high expectations and playing these two teams will provide a good yardstick
7005373 at the beginning of the summer we were looking at ways of raising money but now we are happy with xabi he is a very good player
7005374 the offer we had was not good enough so why would we want to sell him
7005375 we have had an approach from stoke about sami but we want to keep him
7005376 when we talked about a new contract in the summer it was clear that sami wanted to stay at the club
7005377 there still might be one more player to come in
7005378 we have a short squad and we cant afford injuries like other clubs its fine when everyone is fit
7005379 i signed silvestre because he was the kind of player who can complete our team in every aspect of what we needed a left footed player experience at the back and some maturity as well
7005380 the thinking is that he has a great team attitude and we are a bit light in terms of experience in the dressing room so he can help us on that front
7005381 we have to make sure we do not make calamitous defensive errors and that arsenal have to work hard for their goals
7005382 whenever you play against the top four you know you are in for a tough game but we have to believe we can get a result
7005383 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club and the premier league he never intended this
7005384 dr thaksin has been really open about this he has said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing
7005385 i think there is a very loose term about what is a fit and proper person it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last ten years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
7005386 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle
7005387 real madrid have become aware of the declarations by the player and deeply regret their content
7005388 real madrid would never want to retain a player against his wishes and as a result they have no alternative but to accept his unilateral decision to rescind his contract if that is what the player wants
7005389 ive told the president the directors and the coach that my aim is to leave real madrid
7005390 ive heard nothing from arsene wenger himself so it is strange i read his comments and i just thought they were strange
7005391 what i would say is that arsene wenger doesnt usually come out with comments like that i accept he has made a bit of a slip
7005392 he barry is a great player and he has played exceptionally well for us in the last two games and that is the most important thing for aston villa
7005393 we are delighted with his commitment and we would be delighted if he stayed that has been our stance all the way through
7005394 i have had no word about arsenal wanting gareth barry and that is all i want to say on the subject

7005416 we believe were going to qualify but we know theres a lot of hard work to be done as long as we work hard as a team and stay together as a unit well have a good chance
7005417 simon has been a great servant to this club over the last few years we were trying to tie something up with him here but unfortunately he has not been able to get what he was looking for he is disappointed we havent been able to work things out

7005420 according to the classical model there ought not to be these differences
7005421 according to this both brown dwarfs and stars ought to emerge from interstellar clouds of gas which become concentrated because of the attraction of their mass but if this was the case these celestial bodies should behave in similar ways
7005422 for this we analysed the masses of newly born stars
7005423 this revealed a jump in the distribution of mass which makes the division in the stellar population apparent

7005512 il pd non sta messo benissimo questo si sa potrebbe per andare anche peggio se non indovinasse le mosse di una ripresa autunnale che doveva essere caratterizzata dalloffensiva contro il governo ma si presenta pi che altro piena di trappole per lo stesso pd
7005513 alcune delle trappole prosegue larticolo le piazzano gli stessi dirigenti democratici
7005514 il pd scrive leditorialista si trova in una scomoda posizione come si muove sbaglia sia che alle regionali si presenti da solo facendosi battere sia che invece riesca a vincere visto che per ottenere questo risultato dovrebbe passare sotto le forche caudine di unaltra alleanza forzosa con di pietro per non parlare aggiungo io dellimprobabile alleanza con la riottosa e per sua scelta sempre pi settaria rifondazione comunista a gestione ferrero che va invece considerato un avversario per motivi oggettivi e per sua volont soggettiva

7005523 at one point we had two 802 airtractors two helicopters 17 grassfire units and four or five other appliances to control the fire
7005524 we managed to get the fire under control by around noon sunday
7005525 the malicious acts of arsonists put the lives of a great number of people at risk
7005526 landholders need to be reminded that they are responsible for taking measures to reduce the risk of bushfire and ensuring they have fire breaks
7005527 without the outstanding response of fire crews there was a real chance it could have reached rural properties

7005565 it doesnt matter whether it is at pittodrie or ibrox when the two sides meet it is always a wonderful occasion and hopefully for the right reasons
7005566 it is always two teams that want to win football games but it is always a fair game we have had a good record against them in the past here and hopefully we can keep that going
7005567 rangers had a massive disappointment in lithuania a couple of weeks but im very impressed with how they have come back after what happened
7005568 on top of that it was a crushing blow for them to lose their best player and probably the best player in scotland for three months in barry ferguson but all credit to them as they have won two very difficult league games
7005569 our members had no reluctance taking strike action we simply cant afford a 2 5 per cent rise and our members are in no mood to take this on the chin
7005570 we are pleased that cosla has approached us to re open talks on this years pay award following the successful strike by members of the three unions on wednesday
7005571 members made it very clear on wednesday that they want a settlement that protects them from inflation and does not lock them in to multi year awards the talks are welcome but are not in themselves a solution
7005572 we will be talking to our fellow unions to agree future action should it be required
7005573 our strategy is for a series of one day stoppages as well as selective action from groups of workers
7005574 theres a legal requirement to keep things moving so it would be within weeks but we will need to see what happens with these talks
7005575 it is very disappointing to learn that future action is already being considered this preempts the outcome of further discussions between cosla and the unions that are yet to take place
7005576 everyone is finding things hard during these difficult economic conditions but i do not believe industrial action is the answer

7005688 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7005689 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7005690 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7005709 the completion of enrollment in this trial marks a significant milestone for indevus our shareholders and for women who may benefit from a product that provides a female controlled option for hiv and std prevention
7005710 we have now completed enrollment in two pivotal trials with over 12 000 women participating if the trials are successful we expect to be in a position to file marketing applications with regulatory authorities including a new drug application with the u s food and drug administration in 2010
7005711 there is an urgent medical need for effective treatment options for non small cell lung cancer because current treatment strategies have only a minimal impact on survival
7005712 the majority of patients who are newly diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer have locally advanced or metastatic disease that is currently incurable we look forward to evaluating the potential of mapatumumab plus chemotherapy to offer a new approach to the first line treatment of this deadly disease
7005713 a growing body of preclinical data suggests that combining hgs etr1 with chemotherapy agents could be an effective approach to the treatment of a number of malignancies including non small cell lung cancer
7005714 hgs etr1 is the most advanced of any product in development that targets the trail apoptotic pathway the nsclc study is one of three ongoing hgs trials designed to evaluate combinations of hgs etr1 with chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of specific cancers

7005716 our concept is about combining beautiful jewellery with social responsibility and ethical conduct that every single of our suppliers of raw materials gold platinum diamonds and pearls can account for that the production has been carried out with respect for the nature the environment and the workers in short we want that the process of formation of the jewellery becomes transparent to everybody
7005717 we know that it is not a small operation to incorporate sustainability in all phases of the production of jewellery but we see it as our duty to try to influence the world by starting ourselves to think in a socially far sighted and environmentally responsible way

7005721 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7005722 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7005723 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7005724 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7005725 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7005726 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to take part in the icc champions trophy
7005727 we are ready to hold the champions trophy as we are the alternative venue for the tournament
7005728 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7005729 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7005730 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7005731 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7005732 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7005733 the first girl i saw was 35 and wearing a mit ballroom dancing sweatshirt but then i saw heather and she looked like the only normal person there so we met
7005734 he was in business class and we had to wait until they got him off why are they giving so much time to a convicted paedophile
7005735 pleased to be back because for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
7005736 we are suspecting some more militant are hiding in the area the operation still continues

7005738 i got beat fair and square but the judging was terrible so it was
7005739 there is no way i lost 15 0 i scored at least five shots its a disgrace they are going to kill themselves
7005740 i felt them stick to his face just shows you in china one of the most corrupt countries in the world i have never seen more corrupt judging there is no doubt about him winning well i am just not happy to be getting no points
7005741 they can keep it for all i care bronze is meant for losers
7005742 he was outclassed tonight your man was at the best that he has been in this tournament he has been unbeatable for the last four or five years around the world and he really turned it on tonight
7005743 you are beaten by one or you are beaten by 20 you are beaten paddy is probably ashamed that he never scored a point in four rounds of boxing thats not good for your morale he certainly had four of five hits on the scoreboard today in china though they are watching the world champion nobody else is really watching paddy barnes though
7005744 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7005745 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7005746 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7005747 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7005748 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7005749 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

7005751 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7005752 when she is not being shown she is just another working dairy cow and its very hard to get the ball on the tail right so she is wearing a piece
7005753 at a recent meeting our local county dairy committee chairmen themselves identified the necessity for milk purchasers to co operate more on areas such as farm milk collection bulk milk transport and milk processing in particular
7005754 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7005755 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7005756 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7005757 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7005758 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7005759 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7005760 i studied adverts in the new york times from 1850 where there were no 99 endings to the 1870s and 1880s where they started to appear although department stores were doing it which would fit with the cash register hypothesis they were advertising discounts but for the regular price they would use a round number
7005761 i only did what anyone would have done in the situation
7005762 see this michael keep this around and youll always have a meal or a place to sleep or both
7005763 people who got places to sleep will let you stay a night but you have to pay 10 and i dont have money so i clean up fix things that woman you saw she probably will clean for a good nights sleep maybe a store needs mopping maybe your uncle needs his garage cleaned
7005764 and you have to be out by 6 a m if you got kids you cant take them out in the cold so you stay in a store or you stay in a vacant building and no more food kitchens since the projects went down not a lot for poor people
7005765 see this always have a loose cigarette you can always use a bathroom in somebodys house maybe even get a shower for one maybe your kid took a dump in his pants maybe you need some toilet tissue always keep a cigarette for emergencies
7005766 negligence and profusion therefore must always prevail more or less in the management of the affairs of such a company
7005767 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7005768 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7005769 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7005770 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7005771 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7005772 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7005773 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7005774 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7005775 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7005776 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7005779 do not represent a majority of our shareholders and they are the only investors we have heard from on this matter
7005780 over the past 15 years the companys annualized total shareholder return was 15 2 percent and last tuesday plum creeks stock hit an all time high of 50 per share this performance is quite contrary to the dow jones being down more than 13 percent this year and the s amp p 500 being down more than 12 percent

7005785 so have we decided if a confident liberal libido loving gal would be confortable in a hooters
7005786 why in the hell would you second guess an opportunity like this
7005787 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7005788 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

7005790 so many of these listings or upgrades show different faces of the history of the slave trade from an elaborate headstone erected by an earl for a beloved servant once a slave in virginia to an upgrade for a house occupied by a former slave turned prosperous coal merchant
7005791 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7005792 the tatas will be accorded red business steps to save energy become permanent berkshire eagle
7005793 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7005794 la situation est tranquille des transf rements doivent avoir lieu dans lapr s midi de samedi
7005795 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7005796 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7005797 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7005798 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7005799 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7005800 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7005801 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7005802 who are open to doing something on the production side
7005803 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7005804 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7005805 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7005806 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7005807 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7005808 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7005809 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7005810 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7005811 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7005812 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7005813 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7005814 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7005815 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7005816 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7005817 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7005818 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7005819 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7005820 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7005821 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7005822 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7005823 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7005824 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7005825 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7005826 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7005827 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7005828 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7005829 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7005830 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7005831 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7005832 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7005833 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7005834 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7005835 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7005836 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7005844 i think what was happening then and what wed like to see more of was that the agency was truly a partner with clients
7005845 its a response not so much specifically to nostalgia but a response to the complexity
7005846 whatever happened to unwavering accountability it came to a point where we didnt even recognize ourselves any more
7005847 the current model in canada sees agencies spending the energy on award show freebies dog walkers while doing the bare minimum on their paying clients businesses we became increasingly uneasy with this as we find it unethical and immoral
7005848 i think you are seeing a business cycle where people are rejecting the ad industrys fragmentation there is now a desire to get to where everybody started in the business before it fragmented in that golden age of advertising when the show is set there was a philosophy of getting things done

7005851 kenny miller two goals at pittodrie turning a 1 1 draw into a 3 1 victory this came after miller scored the second goal in a 4 1 victory at falkirk which again looked like being a 1 1 draw thats four points attributable to kenny misser if we are talking in terms of impact and the papers were insinuating there was a crisis at the club after the 0 0 draw with killie he could be worth a mention
7005852 is this centre half of the year darren odea and bobo get my votes
7005853 i think we dropped about 9 points with pressley in the team im not saying we wouldnt have dropped points had we played bobo instead but i reckon it wouldve been less than 9
7005854 the closest full back to getting into my top ten would have been caddis his couple of performances overshadowed anything by his more experienced peers id like to think he will get a few more opportunities next season
7005855 he has ability but is not suited to scottish football imo kind of like donati more suited to european style football
7005856 naylor will not do no matter how hard he tries
7005857 i liked jarosik but he was a bit of a fairy tbh
7005858 mark burchill was probably our most consistent scorer one year by that statistic the question is can samaras impress for 90 minutes
7005859 samaras is a good player he is a good talent with two good feet a good finisher has a good touch makes intelligent runs and is a great header of the ball
7005860 hes a far better striker than jan vennegoor of hesselink and should be played from the start in the run in
7005861 donati was probably potm in september as he started the season very very brightly when we were scoring a lot of goals and playing good football donati had a few good games on the spin in january including an outstanding display against kilmarnock in what was a shocking team display since january however everytime he has played his erse has been parked on the halfway line
7005862 thankfully we signed a german internationalist defender who is pretty decent at going forward and defending looked like to took him a few weeks to get to speed with the scottish game he hadnt played regularly for seville so it was hardly surprising but once he did he looked more than a decent player i look forward to seeing more of him next season
7005863 i left scott brown out altogether from my top 10 as i struggled to think of a game he played where he contributed a great deal
7005864 i think scott will be important player for us next season and many seasons to come i for one hope that he stays
7005865 big mick seems to be getting a bit of stick but it has to be remembered that he is playing inside naylor who has probably been our worst performer this season
7005866 mcmanus has been steady all season not his best season imo but nonetheless consistent with it
7005867 am i right in saying that he is still only 25 i think he has the potential to mature into a top class centre half a lot may argue with that though
7005868 caldwell was above mcmanus for a good reason hes been better at centre half for the majority of the season take right back out of the equation and caldwell would have been even higher imo
7005869 personally i think caldwell has shown recently to be far more reliable and consistent than mcmanus
7005870 jvoh to me still remains an enigma but thanks for some very very big goals this season
7005871 if it wasnt for big jan we wouldnt have won the league
7005872 the guy is a genius his touch control passing is incredible
7005873 even when hes not on form his lows are better than many players highs
7005874 hartley has not been our most eye catching player of 07 08 but in my opinion he was the most important more crucial even than mcgeady or boruc or the strikers
7005875 glad to see hartley getting so many votes gave him 1st place myself i dont know if hes the outright player of the year but an unsung hero nonetheless
7005876 i would say our decent form started in the old firm game at ibrox that coincided with hartleys return to the team rangers literally had one chance and scored apart from that we completely bossed their midfield hartley was a notable absentee from the home motherwell game we lost i know its in vogue to big up robson and sure he deserves a lot of praise but for me the unsung hero of this campaign when we really needed it was hartley
7005877 hes not the best midfielder we have in terms of ability he doesnt have the physique of sno the energy of brown the long range passing of donati or the vision of naka but what he has given us is a respect for the jersey a willingness to play and work hard for the jersey and the heart and willingness to perform a less fashionable role
7005878 last night i was watching the highlights of the game vs well and it occurred to me that robson looks to have the attributes to be celtic captain after all he done well as dundee united captain so why not here
7005879 i think the lad has been a pleasant surprise to a lot of guys on here i was delighted when we got him because he could do exactly what we needed and so far hasnt let us down
7005880 i have to say that im really warming to barry robson as a celtic player
7005881 we lost more points than anything when boruc and naka got injured especially boruc and that other clown went in goals
7005882 the holy goalie worth 18 points a season imo point proved when he was out the team coincided with our poor run of form at christmas plus his spartak performance made sure we had a decent european campaign
7005883 in my eyes he is the best keeper in the world
7005884 buffon might be a better goalie but he doesnt hate the huns as much
7005885 elsewhere on this board ive made no secret of the fact that i dont rate scott macdonald he is a decent squad player who will no doubt bang in a few goals in the spl but he is not going to do anything in the cl on the other hand i rate young stephen naismith as one of scotlands most promising talents who is possibily on the way to our biggest rivals i feel it will be a terrible mistake for him to slip through our fingers
7005886 mcdonald is a niggly wee pest and probably a good squad player at best
7005887 its in the record weve bid 750 000 for the wee tosser i hope this isnt true hes rotten and hes built a career on one game let the huns have him
7005888 hes had a great season and its a great return especially considering he cost next to nothing
7005889 we wouldnt have a chance if it wasnt for mcdonalds goals this season he has been immense and i fancy him to score every time he is on the teamsheet
7005890 30 plus goals in his first season the winner against the european champions and a couple past the huns means hes good enough to wear it no7 hes got to do what he hasnt so far and thats score at ibrox
7005891 for me mcdonald got top spot for the goal return an exceptional tally for a player who is still young and new to the club
7005892 mcgeady is not a winger and never has been unless he gets the opportunity to prove himself more centrally hell wither
7005893 maloney was the double player of the year mcgeady has been nowhere near that yet
7005894 i really hope im wrong but i have an awful feeling that well still be debating mcgeadys potential in another two years time
7005895 maloney should be the example to any young player wanting to break into the first team he has set the bar very high though and aiden failed to come close to the impact maloney made i hope just aiden has more competition this season because he is never consistent enough to hold down a first team place
7005896 i think the number of motms he got from some people last season were just for having his name on the team sheet give me an example of one scintillating display over 90 minutes by mcgeady last season youll struggle tricks and flicks arent enough imo
7005897 i do not see him being a first choice pick this coming season but being used a lot as a sub to turn games or change of tactics unless he can stamp authority on every game he get
7005898 when he starts he is rarely consistent and is too easily bullied off the ball he is far more effective coming off the bench when teams tire in the last 30 mins until he gets stronger i would use him mostly this way
7005899 mcgeady won out due to some of the best individual moments that ive seen at cp in a while benfica barca aberdeen
7005900 mcgeady finally arrived this year and we got i would say great performances early on until he started getting double and triple teamed make no mistake more protection for him and he would be world class
7005901 every player has their price altho in mcgeadys instance i would hate if the club sold him anytime soon hes only gonna get better too must keep him for a few years yet
7005902 i wouldnt take 15m for him hes the only player who has entertained more or less throughout the year really could you imagine how dour celtic would have been to watch without him this season
7005903 i dont know what happened there i had him aiden in my back pocket probably but i didnt tell him that its not a problem for me nothing happened it was a football game and these things happen
7005904 football is about entertaining and thats what aiden is best at

7005969 if the police have waited six days then they cant be surprised why they are facing questions over why it took so long
7005970 its for the police to answer the charge of why theyve been slow they have a responsibility to flag up these kind of incidents to the public as quickly as possible you never know what someone like this might do
7005971 six days is too long what happened on sunday was every womans worst nightmare
7005972 by making the public aware potential witnesses who may have a small but significant piece of information know to come forward when its still fresh in their mind
7005973 our primary concern is public safety and that is paramount in our thoughts when it comes to getting information to the wider public
7005974 when we do release details of a crime or incident we must be entirely satisfied that the information is accurate in order that we do not mislead people or cause unnecessary alarm
7005975 at the same time we also have to consider the implications of releasing that information from an investigative point of view
7005976 such is the nature of many enquiries that it may take some time for the full details of an offence to emerge and on those occasions it is necessary to be confident about the facts before releasing information
7005977 while we understand the concerns of the public and appreciate their assistance we would also ask that they understand the sensitive nature of some of our investigations requires a carefully considered approach
7005978 we can confirm that an incident did take place police are investigating and we will work closely with them to resolve this
7005979 i saw three police cars arrive outside the clinic and some police officers go into the clinic
7005980 i thought maybe one of the patients had got violent
7005981 there was a reliance van parked outside and later on i saw another smaller reliance van turn up
7005982 there were police officers around for a couple of hours they were walking up and down different lanes but i didnt know what they were doing
7005983 your conduct was extremely serious and carried out for no good reason
7005984 we would advise the public not to approach this individual but instead contact police immediately
7005985 the fringe already encourages the performers to be environmentally friendly but the difficulty is enforcement
7005986 these are independent companies but they all want to be a part of the fringe and they currently pay for inclusion in the fringe programme
7005987 what i would like to see is some kind of eco charter drawn up which the companies have to agree to in order to get their place in the programme which would cover the issue of flyers
7005988 i also think we need to discuss other ways in which these shows can advertise because it is questionable what the benefit of flyers is to them and perhaps there is a more sustainable way they can promote themselves
7005989 we always recommend that fringe artists use recyclable paper when producing flyers and with the support of the council large recycling bins have been provided on royal mile so fringe goers can recycle
7005990 the vast majority of performers use paper flyers and we are always willing to work closely with the council to make sure that we minimise waste
7005991 it is great that we now have these recycling containers on the high street but when companies are using laminated plastic flyers or all plastic flyers it is a real problem
7005992 these companies come from all over the world and we need to ensure that they do not leave edinburgh with a big environmental mess to clean up
7005993 we are seeking clarification about the accident from the south african authorities
7005994 when what became the city chambers were built in the 18th century the closes were all levelled off and sealed from above leaving shops and rooms below intact the public is now able to visit this subterranean part of the city but instead of being able to appreciate how people then lived they have to go along with a disneyfied haunted house experience
7005995 in response to sir seans comments we challenge him to put his money where his mouth is
7005996 we invite him to visit the real mary kings close and if he is still unimpressed we will donate 1000 to his chosen charity providing he is prepared to match or better this amount to our chosen charity the sick kids friends foundation at the royal hospital in edinburgh if he is impressed
7005997 we also think he must have forgotten the fact that he has made millions out of dramatising fiction when we are merely dramatising fact
7005998 we look forward to hopefully welcoming him and revealing a very real history connected to the sites amazing past and perhaps even telling him something different about his beloved home city

7006004 the picture is very different in other places but for the time of year it has been very wet much more than expected
7006005 theres more rain expected today and at the start of next week there are suggestions there could be yet more hopefully things will settle down after that though
7006006 the area gets seeded in the spring then its almost immediately covered up again and stays covered for nearly the entire summer
7006007 the land is built on an old loch and with the increasingly poor weather much of the meadows has been turned into a swamp
7006008 i think its time the council took a look at the number of events its putting on
7006009 we got the call this week to tell us we had won the spirit of the fringe award and we were completely shocked but obviously delighted
7006010 there are so many great acts at this years festival and to win the award really encourages us for the future
7006011 our members had no reluctance taking strike action we simply cant afford a 2 5 per cent rise and our members are in no mood to take this on the chin
7006012 we are pleased that cosla has approached us to re open talks on this years pay award following the successful strike by members of the three unions on wednesday
7006013 members made it very clear on wednesday that they want a settlement that protects them from inflation and does not lock them in to multi year awards the talks are welcome but are not in themselves a solution
7006014 we will be talking to our fellow unions to agree future action should it be required
7006015 our strategy is for a series of one day stoppages as well as selective action from groups of workers
7006016 theres a legal requirement to keep things moving so it would be within weeks but we will need to see what happens with these talks
7006017 it is very disappointing to learn that future action is already being considered this preempts the outcome of further discussions between cosla and the unions that are yet to take place
7006018 everyone is finding things hard during these difficult economic conditions but i do not believe industrial action is the answer
7006019 we had a lot of complaints about the gassing of chicks from the germans
7006020 this has gone all round the world and the one country that had a problem with it

7006066 not in compliance with the ceasefire and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7006067 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7006068 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7006069 should go back to the situation before the hostilities started
7006070 the idea is that yes for a temporary period some russian peace forces could stay on next to the border line of ossetia but its temporary it should be for patrolling and it should be until we have an international mechanism
7006071 it was clearly stated that this presence first has to be through patrolling no fixed presence and second should not have an effect on the freedom of movement on roads and trains in this place

7006096 and thus jean erlane met his death facing the enemy redeeming his past behavior with heroic conduct
7006097 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful but inside they are full of dead mens bones and all uncleanness so you too outwardly appear righteous to men but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness
7006098 for we know brothers loved by god that he has chosen you
7006099 because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power with the holy spirit and with deep conviction
7006100 youd better check the color of your jersey and make sure youre on the right team
7006101 continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose
7006102 join the penitent confession of their manifold sins whereby they had forfeited every favor and their humble and earnest supplication that it may please god through the merits of jesus christ mercifully to forgive and blot them out of remembrance
7006103 let us pray almighty god that in all humbleness of spirit we may look always to him for guidance
7006104 may almighty god who is our refuge and our strength in this time of trouble watch over our homeland protect us and grant us patience resolve and wisdom in all that is to come
7006105 our confidence in our ability to meet the challenges of today and of the future
7006106 our dynamic economy continues to generate millions of new jobs and as wages rise and unemployment falls to its lowest level in more than a generation millions of american families are sharing in the bounty of this great land for the first time
7006107 the remarkable growth in human knowledge and technological innovation offers real hope for defeating the age old enemies of humanity poverty famine and disease
7006108 those who were full hire themselves out for bread but those who were hungry cease to hunger even the barren gives birth to seven but she who has many children languishes the lord kills and makes alive he brings down to sheol and raises up the lord makes poor and rich he brings low he also exalts he raises the poor from the dust he lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with nobles and inherit a seat of honor for the pillars of the earth are the lords and he set the world on them he keeps the feet of his godly ones but the wicked ones are silenced in darkness for not by might shall a man prevail those who contend with the lord will be shattered against them he will thunder in the heavens the lord will judge the ends of the earth and he will give strength to his king and will exalt the horn of his anointed
7006109 what can be known about god is evident from the creation of the world his invisible attributes that is his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen through what he has made
7006110 if there is one maverick molecule it would mean that god is not sovereign if god is not sovereign then god is not god
7006111 hypocrites of american christianity look forward to their easter sunrise services while their soldiers rampage
7006112 by simply stating that jesus died for ones sins one can kill and pillage at will safe with the knowledge that jesus took care of it already when he died on that cross
7006113 wars can be waged and nations destroyed all because that crucifixion made it okay
7006114 jesus died for somebodys sins but not mine my sins my own they belong to me
7006115 what shall we say then are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase may it never be how shall we who died to sin still live in it or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into christ jesus have been baptized into his death therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death so that as christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father so we too might walk in newness of life for if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death certainly we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old self was crucified with him in order that our body of sin might be done away with so that we would no longer be slaves to sin for he who has died is freed from sin now if we have died with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ having been raised from the dead is never to die again death no longer is master over him for the death that he died he died to sin once for all but the life that he lives he lives to god even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness but present yourselves to god as those alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness to god
7006116 america can do better than failed policies that have made iraq a mess and let north korea and iran develop nuclear weapons while leaving our own country vulnerable to natural disasters like hurricane katrina
7006117 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults
7006118 its a family of faults and that can contribute to the severity of an earthquake
7006119 i try to keep that as independent from my work as possible
7006120 a purely circumstantial speculative argument but while its speculative its within the scientific bounds of reason
7006121 the coachs award is given to the varsity wrestler who brings something extra to the room every night he may not be the best wrestler on the team but he gives his best at every practice and in every match that extra effort helps both himself and his teammates improve

7006129 ramsey stated that his father was in vietnam during the same time as senator mccain and that the government takes care of senator mccain but not his father who suffers from agent orange
7006130 senator mccain if you are reading this then you are already dead unless of course you cant or dont breathe
7006131 there are numerous substances which are deadly for humans to inhale there are just as many time periods for signs of illnesses to show by which time its to sic late

7006153 our school does its best to train them to be professional to join in the olympics
7006154 the sports schools in some ways are a metaphor for chinese culture as a whole
7006155 american athletes theres a story about some kid in the middle of idaho and they started running
7006156 in china everybody seems to have the same story they were identified when they were 4 because they had long arms or double jointed elbows and then theyre incorporated into this little system that is designed to build champions
7006157 our system is designed for the people with passion and talent but ours is a much more organic process theirs is much more centrally organized china is a country run by engineers
7006158 thats been one of the dangers of this system they are really left to their own devices without skills without an education
7006159 they are denied their childhood in pursuit of this magical goal the nation will achieve its glory by tapping them like being tapped for the armed forces
7006160 i dont think its a coincidence that in china the chinese term for a retired athlete is the same as for a retired serviceman veteran
7006161 stop your growin kid who said you could grow up so fast

7006167 the two new cyber shot phones that we have announced today share certain characteristics both phones place ease of use and best in class picture quality at the heart of their designs
7006168 yet both appeal to different audiences one is engineered to let you take more pictures in more places and the other is designed to look as stunning as the pictures it takes
7006169 i had to ground my pristine teenage daughter for sneaking out to the drive through with some guy named biff
7006170 stuff like this has always been a problem in the midwest and palmdale but never here
7006171 a great way for do it yourself decorators and anyone feeling a bit skittish on a rooms color palette to get a good idea of what their imagined room will be like
7006172 the bh amp g website is very user friendly and easy to maneuver even for computer or design novices
7006173 after choosing the type of room to design selections are given for its wall color curtains pillows trim bedding and window treatments although the basic layout of the room cannot be changed the full color choices of paint fabric and texture really give a realistic view of what has been selected
7006174 the site is great for exploring floor materials and wall colors
7006175 furniture window treatments and appliances are more limited and difficult to realistically place in the image you can select from real manufacturers target design within reach and home decorators but you cant change the color or finishes of the items
7006176 it is very difficult to place the products in the image you can adjust scale and attempt to manipulate the perspective but it would be much easier if the product automatically adjusted into the perspective
7006177 you can use yellow as a bridge from the cooler colors of summer to the warmer colors of fall
7006178 its just a hard color for our eyes to process
7006179 the idea is that you live in a house in harmony with nature
7006180 we know buildings can make you sick so why not approach that from another perspective what can buildings do to make you healthy
7006181 had always been percolating in the back of my mind
7006182 we couldnt find the right house so we considered building one
7006183 its sort of a contemporary frank lloyd wright prairie house
7006184 we dont have a lot on the walls because we figure the windows to the outdoors are our art
7006185 you get close to nature as a result of living here
7006186 friends say they feel the energy and the positive flow when they come here and thats really rewarding
7006187 it was a bit of a challenge designing a kitchen how we wanted it that fit all the principles
7006188 white dinnerware offers a blank canvas for the artistry of food presentation
7006189 white allows you to see the forms and shapes of the dinnerware sometimes with color and pattern you overlook how beautiful and creative theyve been in creating shapes
7006190 white is always a classic choice and can last for generations
7006191 the traditionalist the modernist and everyone in between buys white ware
7006192 i think sometimes people think all white means casual but it doesnt necessarily it can be very special to have all white
7006193 i cant live without my blackberry curve this phone has everything that i need to function throughout the day i also use it for traveling because it has a great navigation system when im busy i let my kids watch tv on it the scheduler is one of the biggest features i utilize i would go crazy if i ever lost it
7006194 the clothes are usually in near perfect condition because as we all know small children grow out of clothes every few months
7006195 with todays lagging economy many moms are making the sacrifice and heading to resale shops rather than the malls and baby boutiques and theyre finding out that shopping resale is no sacrifice at all but rather a way to buy the very best brands in a unique environment at amazing prices
7006196 and we are teaching our kids at a young age that even recycling clothes is cool

7006199 during the summer our first signings were defenders and the reason for that is we wanted to keep clean sheets local amp nations
7006200 walsall have had a big turnover of players in the summer and they got off to a winning start last week so theyll be decent as they were last year local amp nations
7006201 the whole place has been lifted by the three players coming in and the last two results
7006202 weve a big week coming up winning breeds confidence and were taking that into it
7006203 were sticking to the principle of getting the right people in

7006208 both of our ships are flying greek flags in international waters and we are victims of electronic piracy

7006210 the war against terror has to be pursued through a co operative effort between afghanistan pakistan the north atlantic treaty organisation nato and the us
7006211 unfortunately there was no chemistry between general r pervez musharraf and afghan president hamid karzai which did not facilitate co operation between the two countries i think we will see a more co operative phase after musharraf
7006212 i do not think induction of nato or american troops on the pakistani side is even something that anybody seriously considers

7006222 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
7006223 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves

7006229 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7006230 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7006231 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats

7006257 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
7006258 the reader should keep in mind that the building and the records kept within it were destroyed and the remains of all the wtc buildings were disposed of before congressional action and funding was available for this investigation to begin
7006259 the number of building occupants was only about half that expected during normal business hours

7006264 these have been an absolutely fantastic games and theres no doubt that in terms of performance and theatre the chinese have set the bar pretty high

7006266 i am absolutely determined that we come in under the 9 3 billion i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that

7006296 the second one is the end of all military actions the commander in chief of the russian federation has taken a decision to that effect and all military activities have been stopped only peacekeeping actions are still being executed by a special contingent
7006297 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
7006298 i filed this action at this time to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7006299 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
7006300 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
7006301 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
7006302 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
7006303 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
7006304 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
7006305 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
7006306 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
7006307 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
7006308 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
7006309 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
7006310 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
7006311 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
7006312 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
7006313 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
7006314 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
7006315 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
7006316 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
7006317 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
7006318 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us
7006319 we cannot and will not pretend that the eu will continue doing business as usual with moscow this aggression has damaged the eu russian partnership
7006320 the eu should evaluate whether it is possible to continue in an unaltered way the post pca talks negotiations on a new eu russia treaty visa dialogue or other cooperation activities
7006321 we have seen some disagreements between eu member states on many occasions including the georgia issue still it does not create a deep rift
7006322 nato refusing to grant a map membership action plan for georgia and ukraine at the bucharest summit made a principle mistake we can say that it partly led to the situation that we have in georgia today
7006323 by giving a map to georgia and to ukraine we would clearly show to russia how unhelpful it is to even try flexing its muscles
7006324 the eu visa facilitation issue for georgia will have to be raised further as well as a preparation of a comprehensive free trade agreement
7006325 we are against cruelty we are against ethnic cleansing a right to come back home should be guaranteed to the refugees we all agree that murders property destruction annihilation of culture and religion are not to be tolerated that is what we are fighting against bombardments of the aggressor will be mercilessly intensified
7006326 we appeal to all free countries to join us but our actions are not determined by others i will defend the freedom and security of my citizens whatever actions are needed for it our special forces have seized airports and bridges air forces and missiles have struck essential targets
7006327 take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the area
7006328 team of 15 civil emergency planning experts to help georgia assess damage to its civil infrastructure
7006329 support the re establishment of the air traffic system and assist the georgian government in understanding the nature of cyber attacks
7006330 on the whole all of these threats that have been raining down on russia turned out to be empty words
7006331 i think we should still engage with the russians but in a hard headed way and we mustnt allow the russians to feel they are the victims of this affair when they are the transgressors
7006332 for the withdrawal of russian troops to happen two things are necessary the pullback of georgian forces to their barracks and secondly we need to be assured that our peacekeepers are not going to be attacked again russias ambassador to the united nations vitaly churkin said

7006347 it is well documented that the 18 to 20 year old age group engages in both clandestine binge drinking because they drink in seclusion hidden from older americans and in drunk driving
7006348 from a college and college president perspective this clandestine culture of binge drinking is largely a result of the 21 year old drinking age

7006434 im just focusing now on getting my fitness levels back up to 100 per cent
7006435 after that we will see what players the manager brings in during the transfer market and what my role in the team could be
7006436 but this will be my second season at liverpool and hopefully i can take my game to the next level
7006437 we have a lot of exciting attacking players we know we can hurt teams when we attack but we also need to get it right defensively
7006438 its difficult to know where teams will end up this season but we have high expectations and playing these two teams will provide a good yardstick
7006439 there still might be one more player to come in
7006440 we have a short squad and we cant afford injuries like other clubs its fine when everyone is fit
7006441 i signed silvestre because he was the kind of player who can complete our team in every aspect of what we needed a left footed player experience at the back and some maturity as well
7006442 the thinking is that he has a great team attitude and we are a bit light in terms of experience in the dressing room so he can help us on that front
7006443 we have to make sure we do not make calamitous defensive errors and that arsenal have to work hard for their goals

7006448 while rains this month have helped many communities in southwest kansas are still seeing a drought
7006449 well continue to watch this situation closely and take the necessary steps
7006450 a violent education corporal punishment of children in us public schools
7006451 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
7006452 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
7006453 minority students in public schools already face barriers to success
7006454 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
7006455 he took me into the office and gave me three licks he made me hold onto the wall and he paddled me it hurt for about two hours it felt like fire under my butt
7006456 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
7006457 what made me so angry hes three years old he was petrified he didnt want to go back to school and he didnt want to start his new school i was so worried that this was going to constantly be with him equating going to school with being paddled
7006458 i went into the principals office he gave me a chair and said hold onto the chair the paddle had holes in it then he just did three swats i was hit on my buttocks there were holes in the paddle to make it go faster it hurt very much there were definitely red marks and then swelling almost welt like markings it didnt last for more than a couple days it left me feeling very humiliated i think there were several levels of emotion physical pain mental humiliation and being a female at that age it was like there was this older man hitting me on the butt thats weird even at that age i knew it was inappropriate
7006459 ive heard this said at my school and at other schools this child should get less whips itll leave marks students that are dark skinned it takes more to let their skin be bruised even with all black students there is an imbalance darker skinned students get worse punishment
7006460 i see corporal punishment as a form of slavery beating on the slaves was how the headman got them to do something were focused so much on making kids do what we want think about the mental capacity that this kind of treatment leaves our children with we are telling them we dont respect them they leave that principals office and they think they dont consider me a human being that young person loses self respect
7006461 the 2008 beijing games have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good
7006462 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7006463 we believe the games are going to move ahead the agenda of the social and human rights as far as possible the games are going to be a force for good

7006471 this research project will greatly enhance our understanding of the exact relationship between dietary distillers grains and e coli 0157 h7 in cattle as well as provide us with an opportunity to look at novel ways to mitigate the potential risks of feeding this valuable co product
7006472 despite care in food processing and provision there is a possibility that food can become contaminated with potentially harmful bacteria

7006474 using a meat thermometer is the only sure way to tell if meat is properly cooked
7006475 many people have died because of russias use of cluster munitions in georgia even as moscow denied it had used this barbaric weapon
7006476 many more people could be killed or wounded unless russia allows professional demining organizations to enter at once to clean the affected areas
7006477 highly dangerous unexploded bomblets now litter farms roads and pathways in shindisi and pkhvenisi
7006478 people remaining in these areas dont realize the dangers these submunitions pose and are at serious risk of injury or death if they handle or even approach the bomblets
7006479 we did not use cluster bombs and whats more there was absolutely no necessity to do so
7006480 we were playing with them as were the georgian soldiers
7006481 it was only when one of the bombs exploded after a soldier threw it that we understood that they were dangerous

7006538 nello spirito del principio di leale cooperazione istituzionale sancito dallart 22 della legge 241 90 se tra il 1999 e il 2008 il prof brunetta professore ordinario di economia del lavoro presso luniversit romana abbia preso aspettativa o in caso contrario come abbia conciliato tutti i propri incarichi
7006539 e qualora abbia mantenuto attivo il proprio incarico di professore ordinario quante ore di presenza abbia garantito e mantenuto a
7006540 in questi giorni aperto il dibattito sullefficienza e limpegno lavorativo dei dipendenti pubblici un tema portato agli onori della cronaca dal neo ministro prof renato brunetta ricercando questo spirito nel nostro ministro sono rimasto molto colpito dal curriculum del professor brunetta che vanta un passato illustre e prestigioso di attivit e incarichi sia politici sia scientifici
7006541 scorrendo dunque lelenco dei rilevanti impegni risaltano in particolare quelli politici che a partire dal 1999 fino al 2008 lo hanno visto deputato al parlamento europeo con lincarico di vicepresidente della commissione per lindustria la ricerca e lenergia e membro delle delegazioni parlamentari miste ue croazia e ue turchia oltre che della delegazione per le relazioni con la repubblica popolare cinese
7006542 e basti pensare ai professori universitari anche brunetta lo che infatti non si contentano del doppio lavoro ma arrivano al triplo e al quadruplo con le consulenze gli articoli la politica
7006543 insomma non si capisce perch il doppio lavoro porti lustro e credito sociale al professore universitario e al barone accademico che tanto pi stimato quanto meno si fa vedere alluniversit e porti invece decurtamenti dello stipendio licenziamento disprezzo ammiccamenti e smorfie moralistiche allimpiegato di concetto che di sera si trasforma in piccolo muratore
7006544 eppure brunetta crede di essere il nuovo falcone italiano perch nel paese degli abusivi e degli evasori dei conflitti di interesse e delle mafie dichiara guerra al bidello che smonta alle due del pomeriggio e poi a partire dalle quattro va a fare le pulizie in un condominio
7006545 e vuole licenziare non il barone universitario che porta in cattedra moglie figli e parenti vari ma loperaio comunale che terminato il normale turno sale sulla sua ape carica di attrezzi e gira per le case di campagna e ora aggiusta un rubinetto ora monta un lampadario ora sostituisce un interruttore

7006548 marriage will be recognised in the tax system if i am davids chancellor which i fully expect to be then i will implement that there is no disagreement there at all
7006549 of course everyone is entitled to choose how to live their lives and some marriages do fail but we know that in general marriage is an institution that contributes to building a stronger society
7006550 that is why labour was wrong to stop supporting it through the tax system and that is why we will recognise it

7006622 what the hell are these are they supposed to look good
7006623 i first became aware of the letter around midday on friday 22 august and after reviewing its contents convened a meeting with officials to discuss the allegations
7006624 at that meeting i asked for the department to formally assess the material and refer the matter on to the cmc and any other body as necessary
7006625 i have been advised by the under treasurer that the material is now in the hands of the cmc
7006626 i am delighted it will prove the whole thing is a charade
7006627 the horse relaxed lovely did everything right the pace was on and he just joined in the last 100 metres nicely
7006628 he has a long campaign ahead he has the caulfield guineas and the victoria derby ahead of him so its a good way to start
7006629 he raced really well as a two year old he was a big leggy bloke hes still leggy but has grown and matured a lot and i think hes going alright at the moment
7006630 youve never seen a horse eat like him in your life and if you dont keep the work up to him hes just unreal
7006631 we thought wed let him find his feet a bit early and he enjoyed the solid tempo
7006632 for a big horse hes quite agile and he hit the line full of running
7006633 the second horse kicked pretty well in the straight and took a bit of catching but my horse finished very well
7006634 he might not be there for the cameron on that run
7006635 theres probably no point taking him down for the cameron and well revert to plan b and give him another start in brisbane in a fortnight at eagle farm
7006636 but i wasnt that disappointed with the run and hes still going down for the epsom
7006637 if he doesnt run better next time then things might change but im not overly concerned with his run at this stage
7006638 we wanted to go forward but we didnt expect that much speed to be on
7006639 mandy was a victim of circumstances when she got trapped four wide and couldnt get in any closer
7006640 this whole episode started five years ago when alycia lane came to philadelphia
7006641 alycia and i had a flirtatious unprofessional and improper relationship
7006642 i told her the truth i told her i loved her and i apologized i then immediately stopped having long dinners with alycia staying out late with alycia and i stopped allowing her to come into my office to do her makeup everyday
7006643 i can tell you point blank that if he in any way goes forward with this that in addition to being sued for the invasion of privacy i will go after him for defamation
7006644 my career my future my familys future was in trouble
7006645 i ask that this long mutually self destructive feud now end we have both paid a high cost
7006646 his attempt to manipulate the press once more to hurt alycia lane
7006647 do not fall for the claim she does community service work all the time she only goes when the station forces her or when she knows that she is going to be on tv
7006648 we were appalled to learn that but it only points out the extent to which mendte would go to destroy her life
7006649 i have my sources and dont discuss who they are
7006650 the criminal felony invasion of her privacy and publishing her attorney client privilege is a very serious matter
7006651 he did not work the weekend in early july when we had all the hendra issues
7006652 bens role was also more in mobile veterinary practice so he spent more time away from the clinic
7006653 i have an incident in my mind where i suspect it could have happened and in that particular instance that horse was normal it was before it came ill with hendra virus
7006654 the girl who got sick works in the hospital all the time and is one of our senior nurses so i think she had more opportunity
7006655 there were many many people in our clinic who were exposed to these horses on a close basis for an extended period of time and thankfully the great majority did not get infected
7006656 i have no feelings of grudge against anyone who challenges what we did
7006657 i would do absolutely nothing different and feel we did exceptionally well in handling the outbreak and called the authorities very quickly
7006658 i have asked for an independent review of the departments emergency response
7006659 ill do anything to find his killers he meant a lot to me
7006660 but we are united anybody who is hurting we will help
7006661 somebody is definitely not connecting the dots at the department of human services
7006662 if were going to have the continuation of poor management decisions were going to have to use what power we have
7006663 we need intervention from the governor and i think were headed in that direction
7006664 one day i counted 40 in the back where i didnt have nothing planted
7006665 this area has probably the biggest and the longest existing population in the state
7006666 the potential for growth can be exponential if its not kept in check
7006667 we were at a loss of what it was at first because it looked like a rotor tiller came through
7006668 they were black and there were probably about a dozen of them i came out and they ran into the woods
7006669 the pigs would start eating it and theyd start mowing
7006670 they were pretty aggressive when we got closer to them
7006671 we are on an eradication program we dont want them there because of the habitat degradation the competition they pose for native wildlife and the potential for disease they could spread
7006672 if they see you coming they run the opposite way they do theyre not crazy
7006673 we are not going to be able to eradicate them
7006674 our funding was very limited we had about 7 000 for our work and that funding expires on sept 30
7006675 as the waves pound against that surface they eat away at that embankment
7006676 we think if we educate people and address this people will appreciate that
7006677 theres a misconception that you cant get hurt if the waves are small but you have to be careful not to just go out there without thinking
7006678 the beaches are safe as long as youre aware of the situation
7006679 that definition of blight kept getting stretched broader and broader so it started seeming that it was just for the purpose of private development and helping a developer have a more profitable more feasible project
7006680 that condition of the subject properties consisting of retail and accessory uses is detrimental to the safety health morals or welfare of the community
7006681 i did this without her permission and it was wrong
7006682 this is a man obsessed with taking a woman down
7006683 shocking and shows the true lack of remorse which the judge should take into consideration at sentencing
7006684 he continues his attack on the victim with unfounded implications
7006685 larry mendte like all cbs3 employees was treated professionally and fairly during his tenure here his allegations are totally without merit
7006686 to your knowledge is everything he said accurate and correct
7006687 we will not make a specific recommendation as to what sentence the court should impose
7006688 are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty as charged
7006689 i do not intend to do anything at this time until i hear the judges sentence
7006690 what were going to do regarding larry and his employer
7006691 the writer of the anonymous letter had to be aware of the suggestion for community service by the district attorneys office and of lanes resistance to the suggestion
7006692 i ask that this long mutually self destructive feud now end we have both paid a high cost and others have been hurt as well i am sorry to all

7006703 after watching the olympics it really motivated me to come here and get better times
7006704 i kind of remembered how michael phelps did it and tried to swim like him he is just so good
7006705 we have had unprecedented interest in auditions for swim teams
7006706 we are maxed out in four of eight practice groups and we expect to fill everything
7006707 we typically enjoy a membership spike the year after every olympics
7006708 we hope that will be larger than normal because of the phelps phenomenon
7006709 what he has done is so phenomenal and the way he has done it makes his appeal universal
7006710 it was really worth it to see him break that world record
7006711 we have a black population and there are some kids who gravitate to swimming because of race and identifying with cullen
7006712 if and when we have something to announce thats when well talk about it
7006713 in philadelphia in particular location was important because it had to do with generating income
7006714 everything being equal the decisions may have come out differently
7006715 i just dont understand why the three who didnt win wouldnt seek relief allowing them to bid on the same sites
7006716 it leads to the location we had picked and thats where the project should go and it should go with some level of involvement from the original applicants from that site
7006717 itll be good because you get tired of looking at an old building
7006718 there is a very large increase in the amount of attention being paid to these incidents
7006719 reporting across the board has gotten better in the last few years that pushes the numbers up
7006720 we have encouraged principals and other staff members to report incidents directly to the police department and to the school police as well
7006721 we want to make sure that every school provides a safe learning environment for students one incident is too many at the same time i think school districts are doing a good job in providing safe schools and working with law enforcement

7006726 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7006727 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
7006728 stating that in seeking christ they found each other the 147 churches that sixty years ago came together in amsterdam netherlands committed themselves afresh to christ and covenanted with one another in constituting the world council of churches
7006729 it is significant that as we gather sixty years later at the same venue we note that the churches have been faithful to their commitment not only have they stayed together but they have deepened and broadened the fellowship
7006730 today the challenges of seeking visible unity appear to be even stronger but we nevertheless look to the next sixty years with hope and confidence as we are inspired by the spirit of our ecumenical ancestors who made amsterdam 1948 possible said kobia

7006776 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
7006777 dr thaksin has been really open about this he has said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing
7006778 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
7006779 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle
7006780 the truth of it is this club is not going to go out of business this club is not bankrupt were moving forward

7006783 many of the worlds lesser known languages are being lost as fewer and fewer people speak them the governments of countries in which these languages are spoken should act to prevent such languages from becoming extinct
7006784 is it the governments responsibility to protect such languages which are in the edge of extinction
7006785 the material progress and well being of one country are necessarily connected to the material progress and well being of all other countries
7006786 in the age of television reading books is not as important as it once was people can learn as much by watching television as they can by reading books
7006787 the purpose of many advertisements is to make consumers want to buy a product so that they will be like the person in the ad this practice is effective because it not only sells products but also helps people feel better about themselves
7006788 the competition supervisory board has looked into this matter deeply has made video analysis which has been open to all the referees and judges
7006789 in applying paragraph two of page 64 of the competition rules of the world taekwondo federation we have to change this result and we have to declare the british player as winner
7006790 we are very sorry to the spectators of china but justice is first thank you for understanding

7006806 weve been using the altai a8 for special events in columbus circle union square and washington square over the last year and the performance has been outstanding
7006807 for congested rf environments there is no better solution in the market
7006808 we were eager to deploy the altai on the parkwifi network because it is best of breed our goal is to have washington square park become the showcase for how public wifi can be in new york
7006809 we put in a high speed adsl2 line from covad built a local community portal to deliver localized content on the park and neighborhood and then put in the altai
7006810 we wanted to build the best free public wi fi hot spot in new york and we wanted to do it cost effectively
7006811 given the increasing traffic levels and the need to support multimedia and voip in the end the altai a8 base station was the solution of choice we wanted coverage reliability and the ability to support a large number of simultaneous users and the altai delivered in spades a very impressive product
7006812 upgrading washington square park with the a8 gives park goers a superior wi fi experience
7006813 our smart antenna based wi fi solution is being deployed now throughout the world we are pleased that wifi salon chose altai for washington square park and for new york
7006814 if they can not respond positively to government warnings to abandon their non factual reporting then suspending them is inevitable
7006815 this is a new era of peace and fraternity between nigeria and cameroon
7006816 i want to reaffirm that cameroon will honour all the commitments made concerning our nigerian brothers and sisters
7006817 the gains made in adhering to the rule of law may outweigh the painful losses of ancestral homes
7006818 your worth more then what the desert has to offer
7006819 the wi fi business as currently constructed will not provide a return
7006820 long island is not especially early in adopting municipal wi fi which has been embraced in cities from san francisco to new york but it is good to be on the bandwagon
7006821 by upgrading to covads next generation adsl 2 service wifi salon has significantly enhanced its ability to provide new yorkers with free high speed wifi on our parkwifi network people want video they want fast downloads we can now scale to meet the growing demand for high bandwidth and multimedia in public spaces such as parks and commercial districts
7006822 we are very pleased that these industry leading companies have chosen covad broadband to power their wifi hotspot networks
7006823 our next generation broadband services including t1 and bonded t1 adsl and adsl 2 and fixed broadband wireless are uniquely capable of providing the bandwidth to support the multimedia experiences that technology savvy hotspot providers and end users demand
7006824 as service providers and venue owners such as retailers and restaurants increasingly partner to deploy wifi hotspots it is a smart strategy for network providers to focus on providing back end broadband connectivity
7006825 a hotspot is only as good as the pipe connecting it to the internet so broadband capability and data speeds are essential

7006855 n o adianta as pessoas quererem achar um motivo para o que aconteceu isso acontece com qualquer ser humano eu errei
7006856 trabalhei o ano inteiro n o sei o que deu errado n o foi o resultado que esperava vou ver o v deo da prova para entender o que aconteceu
7006857 ganhamos da argentina na copa am rica e hoje na semifinal perdemos e a vida do esportista assim tem que ter a frieza de saber reagir
7006858 temos que olhar a parte emocional a parte psicol gica avaliar isso profundamente pra ver como podemos atuar de maneira positiva para blindar melhor a equipe nesse aspecto
7006859 tem que trabalhar muito e estar preparado para aproveitar o momento que aparece

7006873 after that we will see what players the manager brings in during the transfer market and what my role in the team could be
7006874 but this will be my second season at liverpool and hopefully i can take my game to the next level
7006875 we have a lot of exciting attacking players we know we can hurt teams when we attack but we also need to get it right defensively
7006876 its difficult to know where teams will end up this season but we have high expectations and playing these two teams will provide a good yardstick
7006877 there still might be one more player to come in
7006878 we have a short squad and we cant afford injuries like other clubs its fine when everyone is fit
7006879 i signed silvestre because he was the kind of player who can complete our team in every aspect of what we needed a left footed player experience at the back and some maturity as well
7006880 the thinking is that he has a great team attitude and we are a bit light in terms of experience in the dressing room so he can help us on that front
7006881 we have to make sure we do not make calamitous defensive errors and that arsenal have to work hard for their goals
7006882 whenever you play against the top four you know you are in for a tough game but we have to believe we can get a result

7006892 queremos que los reclusos aprendan cosas que se impliquen en el campo de trabajo pero sobre todo que sepan qu es lo que est n haciendo y por qu lo hacen
7006893 el hecho de poder salir de la c rcel durante estos cinco d as al menos por unas horas supone un premio para nosotros una recompensa contribuye a romper la rutina de la prisi n que es brutal y que desestructura el tiempo que estamos en el campo tenemos una sensaci n de casi libertad

7006896 la historia la puedes leer y aprender en los libros

7006914 we are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they cant make decisions for themselves
7006915 about 30 per cent of people with hepatitis b will develop cancer or cirrhosis and die young i dont understand why these people are willing to sacrifice their child for a warped idea when the benefits far outweigh the risks
7006916 a few years ago i went to a party at the playhouse on the rockefeller estate in pocantico and a friend of david rockefellers stood up to introduce dr and decided to share a story about a day of shopping with dr in italy
7006917 consumers have more options at their disposal to discover new music today than ever before says tanner at the same time discovering new entertainment still is very much influenced by ones pers and word of mouth suggestion it is no surprise that online social media mediums can carry an important role for artists and labels alike to promote themselves
7006918 at least 70 innocent civilians most of them women and children
7006919 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be

7006925 its a tough job but its your job and were going to do it this week against swansea
7006926 it should be good to see them his former swansea team mates but come the game theres no friends on the field
7006927 its a big week for us three games in a week before the international break charlton are going to be there or thereabouts in this division at the end of the season so thats a good yard stick
7006928 and then crystal palace neil warnock came in they had a great run and ended up in the play off positions so healthy respect from me for crystal palace
7006929 they had an indifferent start at home to preston which was strange then they won in the cup against orient and it looked like they murdered burnley
7006930 ive just watched the game they didnt really but nevertheless a 3 0 win away from home is a great victory
7006931 i dont have kellens body im not the physical freak like him but i learned a lot from him
7006932 what i am right now is what i learned from him last year
7006933 he really took the time this summer to get himself in the best shape he can be in during the spring practices he showed he could be a good run blocker in our offense
7006934 then the work he put in with the quarterbacks during the summer has shown in the camp that he has had
7006935 over the summer wed get together and run routes and work on timing
7006936 that was very important for timing between me and hoyer
7006937 garrett celek has shown signs hes a redshirt freshman so he is still a little green as a run blocker he has done some really good things routes he continues to improve he has all the ability he has everything there
7006938 david is a good route runner sometimes when he gets jammed up hell be a little short in his routes but i am pleased with both of them
7006939 when we got here when i first sat down with kellen we had a year together there were so many things that we were only able to scratch the surface with kellen
7006940 its a great thing i get charlie for three more years so there are so many more pieces to the puzzle that we can put in that we have time to work and have time to do things
7006941 last year what a phenomenal run they had and their players caught the eye
7006942 particularly their skipper brian howard hes going to be a guy that we have to make sure we try and keep quiet hes a good player and good players make things happen on their own
7006943 and theyve got the experience of big darren moore at the back if were looking to win this game we have to make sure their best players are not playing well
7006944 was a position that was needed when we were going through the implementation of the sale the docs that needed to be reviewed were doing with the sale were now in the compliance with the terms of the sale
7006945 there are issues that do exist currently and the lieutenant governor outl

7006947 for what it has acknowledged responsibility for the attempt to destroy us as a race of people by taking away our children
7006948 the nation will be enhanced by the constitutional recognition it accords indigenous peoples because governments need to be made accountable in their dealings with aboriginal peoples

7006954 we conservatives forced the government to allow the parliamentary ombudsman to investigate the regulation of equitable life and we welcome her report
7006955 the ombudsman rightly highlights regulatory failings including those between 1998 and 2001 when gordon brown and the treasury had responsibility for this area he cannot escape the blame for what happened on his watch
7006956 were glad that the report accepts the principle that there should be payments to those who lost out the job now is to assess how much those payments should be and to whom they should be paid

7006979 it is the first time i have been into the olympic games probably because they are in beijing
7006980 there has been some amazing athletes particularly michael phelps the highlight for me has been the determination to do well and the amount of talent there
7006981 they are interested in chinas gold medals but they will not watch the whole programme only the highlights
7006982 they deserve the glory they made the effort and did the training
7006983 when i was little and living in southern china it was very poor especially under japanese occupation
7006984 but now i have noticed all the changes and the people in china are better off
7006985 its inside how you feel and i dont know how to express it
7006986 the most important part is letting the world know about china most of the time they dont see the true colours of china it is not always how the press shows it
7006987 there is an issue im not denying that but we just need more to time to sort it out china is a big country and there is a lot of educating and developing to do
7006988 the truth is i dont know what they are going to do after the olympics but i would like it to stay that way i would like to see olympic spirit continue
7006989 many people dont know china very well and the opening ceremony was all about chinas history
7006990 the director just wanted to show the best of china to the rest of the world
7006991 the west views china as poor with no food they want to show the world that china is growing up they want to connect with the world
7006992 the chinese government has problems same as every country there are so many people and it is difficult to change quickly i think the olympics have shown they are trying
7006993 wir sind dabei uns auf ein gemeinsames papier zu einigen
7006994 es darf nicht l nger sein dass schweigen als zustimmung gilt

7006996 die bewertungen der aktien haben zwar inzwischen relativ attraktive niveaus erreicht das makro konomische umfeld tr bt sich allerdings weiterhin ein
7006997 stabile trends gibt es derzeit nicht und auf einzelnachrichten wird je nach stimmungslage mit einem hin und herpendeln zwischen zwei extremszenarien reagiert
7006998 mir fehlt die phantasie warum das umfeld f r aktien besser werden sollte
7006999 ich glaube nicht dass wir die 6000er marke im dax in den n chsten zwei bis drei monaten halten k nnen
7007000 das einzige was aktien in n chster zeit treiben kann ist das thema inflation

7007006 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
7007007 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
7007008 st norbert college is an outstanding institution with a great foundation
7007009 as we kick off the academic year i will continue to challenge our college community to pursue excellence in all areas including many of the categories listed in the u s news rankings
7007010 we are aware of our ranking by u s news and understand that people make certain judgments about schools based on these types of rankings

7007027 theres nobody happy with the way were playing baseball right now
7007028 that losing a sense of urgency because of their large lead is one of the things weve talked about the challenge of this season is game to game not where you are in the standings or whether youre chasing someone or not
7007029 thats part of the challenge but the way you get there is day to day game to game anything short of that becomes a distraction we need to filter out all distractions thats step one and thats what were addressing

7007043 there has been a lot of fluctuation in the price but what has to be seen are the trends
7007044 in opec we have to evaluate if this is becoming a downward trend in order to make a decision about production that is our proposal but we have to consider it there in opec
7007045 nobody is thinking about adding new production to the market
7007046 is impacting the development of concepts such as enterprise 2 0
7007047 it may have been more valuable at one time but with meetups and internet connectivity i wonder if classrooms are going to go the way of business offices distributed open mobile
7007048 our interest in balde is no secret but i am conscious of the window shutting and im looking at other central defenders
7007049 maybe he has some loose ends to tie up at celtic but i cant wait forever
7007050 some people might not like relegation promotion relegation promotion but would you want to be a middlesbrough stuck in mid table every season
7007051 i supported man united as a kid obviously a lot of my mates supported forest so when i went there on loan there was a lot of hype
7007052 its a game im looking forward to its going to be a good game i know that much
7007053 i was going through a difficult time when i went there so it was a shame that i got injured obviously it wasnt meant to be
7007054 i came in early for pre season and wanted to do well for my own pride
7007055 i have a lot of things that i want to achieve and i think by reaching these goals i can really help the club as well now i just have to carry on from that goal and step up to new heights
7007056 i shouldnt have come to a situation to leave celtic
7007057 i knew it was not the right move in my heart of hearts i knew villa was not the club i wanted to play for
7007058 i let the club down when i went away now im nervous about the reaction of the celtic fans this weekend
7007059 there might be some who wont forgive me but ill try to win them over by what i do on the park
7007060 i wouldnt describe the last 18 months as the most miserable of my life but it hasnt been a pleasant experience
7007061 initially the manager at villa wasnt too happy about it all and i could understand his reaction but martin knew i wanted back to celtic and that i wasnt happy in the midlands
7007062 i wouldnt have a bad word to say about aston villa i made a lot of good friends there but it just wasnt where i wanted to be
7007063 that rumour was certainly none of my doing i was never at murray park
7007064 team gb have done fantastically well i have been watching the olympics all the time but football has always been my main goal
7007065 i did athletics to keep fit in the summer when the football season finished
7007066 my best time was 11 01 seconds at the english schools finals when i was 16 i am not sure what i would do now you dont really do 100m work in football but with training who knows
7007067 i should be under 11 seconds definitely and maybe somewhere close to ten seconds flat
7007068 i would love to play at liverpool but david wheater did fantastically well in that position last week so it is up to the manager said hoyte
7007069 i didnt play much last season so this was a great opportunity for regular first team football
7007070 there are similarities in the way they want their team to play quick passing entertaining football
7007071 arsenal are a young attacking team and i know middlesbrough like to play in the same way
7007072 i like to get forward a lot from right back but my main function is to defend and that is always my first duty
7007073 david bentley moved on from arsenal and played very well at blackburn which got him into the england team hopefully i can perform well for boro first and eventually get in the england side

7007136 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults
7007137 its a family of faults and that can contribute to the severity of an earthquake
7007138 i try to keep that as independent from my work as possible

7007142 there still might be one more player to come in
7007143 we have a short squad and we cant afford injuries like other clubs its fine when everyone is fit
7007144 i signed silvestre because he was the kind of player who can complete our team in every aspect of what we needed a left footed player experience at the back and some maturity as well
7007145 the thinking is that he has a great team attitude and we are a bit light in terms of experience in the dressing room so he can help us on that front
7007146 we have to make sure we do not make calamitous defensive errors and that arsenal have to work hard for their goals
7007147 whenever you play against the top four you know you are in for a tough game but we have to believe we can get a result
7007148 im just focusing now on getting my fitness levels back up to 100 per cent
7007149 after that we will see what players the manager brings in during the transfer market and what my role in the team could be
7007150 but this will be my second season at liverpool and hopefully i can take my game to the next level
7007151 we have a lot of exciting attacking players we know we can hurt teams when we attack but we also need to get it right defensively
7007152 its difficult to know where teams will end up this season but we have high expectations and playing these two teams will provide a good yardstick
7007153 almost every it project involves data storage of some kind and for most that means a relational database management system rdbms this book is written for a database centric audience database modelers architects designers developers etc the authors do a great job of showing us how to take a project from its initial stages of requirements gathering all the way through to implementation along the way we learn how to handle some of the real world design issues that typically surface as we go through the process
7007154 only through sustainability can our teams remain motivated and successful

7007166 i could have gone my whole life and such a concept would have never occurred to me
7007167 i studied it in depth for three months before making a complete paradigm shift from a saturday sabbath to what i call the lunisolar creation sabbath
7007168 its total bunk these woman dont know anything from whence they speak
7007169 the bible says on the seventh day god rested and hallowed it that was from the creation of the world i dont know how much clearer you can get the weekly sabbath has nothing to do with the lunar or solar year it never has not even until this day jesus followed the same seventh day that jews and saturday observant christians follow today
7007170 the origin of the jewish calendar can no longer be accurately traced
7007171 the seventh day of the week the day of rest
7007172 the new moon is still and the sabbath originally was dependent upon the lunar cycle
7007173 i have heard of catholics ive talked to people with the worldwide church of god messianic jews people in africa australia so its not just a localized thing
7007174 the offer was to anyone who could give one bible verse showing that god commands us to keep holy the first day of the week sunday instead of the seventh day saturday
7007175 so i read the letter that you received looking for the required bible verse i couldnt find it why not because its not there
7007176 both ministers and people have responded seeking to show the desired change of gods holy sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week they say many nice things but scripture proof is always lacking
7007177 any society that tried to carry on their schools church or business without a continuous weekly cycle would be in utter chaos the poor people would get so confused that they wouldnt know what to do
7007178 he pointed out that the seventh day sabbath being saturday has so permeated the cultures of the world for so long that many languages have the exact same word for both
7007179 the challenge will continue but society is now in such a state that i will ask for people to use either the authorized king james version of the bible or the new king james version lest someone try to get the money by writing a book with the desired statement in it and call their book the bible
7007180 no one has ever even tried to find out how many there are as the focus has always been on the truth itself rather than how many adhere to that truth
7007181 for me it has not been difficult in the least because i am self employed and do not have children in school
7007182 my husband however is not with me in this but i see the spirit of god working with him as he is studying his bible as never before

7007191 i adored writing and used to pray for bad weather so that i need not go out but could stay in and write
7007192 mr salteena woke up rarther early next day and was delighted to find horace the footman entering with a cup of tea oh thankyou my man said mr salteena rolling over in the costly bed mr clark is nearly out of the bath sir announced horace i will have great pleasure in turning it on for you if such is your desire well yes you might said mr salteena seeing it was the idear
7007193 i say said mr salteena excitedly i have had some tea in bed
7007194 i shall put some red ruge on my face said ethel becouse i am very pale owing to the drains in this house
7007195 mr salteena was an elderly man of 42 and fond of asking people to stay with him
7007196 i do hope i shall enjoy myself with you i am fond of digging in the garden and i am parshal to ladies if they are nice i suppose it is my nature i am not quite a gentleman but you would hardly notice it but cant be helped anyhow
7007197 when the great morning arrived mr salteena did not have an egg for his breakfast in case he should be sick on the journey
7007198 my own room is next the bathroom said bernard it is decerated dark red as i have somber tastes the bathroom has got a tip up basin
7007199 after dinner ethel played some merry tunes on the piano and bernard responded with a rarther loud song in a base voice and ethel clapped him a good deal then mr salteena asked a few riddles as he was not musicle

7007275 to the man who loves art for its own sake
7007276 it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived it is pleasant to me to observe watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up and i am bound to say occasion ally to embellish you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province
7007277 i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records
7007278 it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter
7007279 if i claim full justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thing a thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales
7007280 today and during this conference we all have to look at the reasons why voters should support us with their votes as ifp in the forthcoming election if we do not provide a compelling answer to that question then we are already doomed
7007281 i know that of all opposition parties that the ifp is the party that operates against most odds
7007282 the point i wish to make upfront is that the availability of these billions could have made a better life for the poorest of the poor were it not for the fact that honesty integrity and courage are rare commodities that are not in abundance amongst us as representatives of the people at all these levels
7007283 it is clear that so far a lot of the money that the fiscus makes available for delivery does not reach the people that we so glibly promise a better life because we have amongst us too many representatives at all levels who lack honesty integrity and courage

7007306 i cant face telling my boys because they are so young they think mummy has a tummy ache

7007311 then it hit me that some women get cancer and will never become mums i realised i should be so thankful for my gorgeous sons and decided i was going to take this horrible disease on and win
7007312 im tortured by the fact people think this is a stunt
7007313 since big brother my life has been fashioned by publicity but no way would i want anyone to be in my shoes now i have to try and brush that sort of stuff aside and concentrate on living and getting well again

7007339 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7007340 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7007341 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7007342 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7007343 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7007344 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7007345 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7007346 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7007347 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7007348 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7007349 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7007350 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7007351 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7007352 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7007353 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7007354 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7007355 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7007356 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7007357 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7007358 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7007359 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7007360 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7007361 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7007362 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7007363 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7007364 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7007365 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7007366 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7007367 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7007368 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7007369 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7007370 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7007371 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7007372 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7007373 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7007374 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7007375 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7007376 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

7007379 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7007380 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7007381 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7007382 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7007383 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

7007388 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania

7007407 a firms image should be represented at the highest quality possible
7007408 good graphic design is absolutely essential to powerful client presentations and deliverables
7007409 an exceptional graphic presentation is essential in portraying the quality of our firm the client the project and the opportunity
7007410 a large part of our business involves visual representation to convey ideas to our clients in some cases clients are not accustomed to thinking visually
7007411 we need to overcome this so that our ideas are not lost in translation
7007412 the potential impact of hiring a graphic designer would be a more streamlined production of deliverables increased profits and most importantly satisfied clients

7007441 everybodys watching whats going on in beijing right now with the olympics think about the amount of money that china has spent on infrastructure
7007442 ignores how those structures were assembled the source and conditions of the labor the lack of pollution controls in beijing and throughout china the many complaints that chinese infrastructure outside the olympics zone remains shoddy the recent record of chinese manufacturing scandals including the heparin fiasco which killed many americans and of course the catastrophe brought about by chinese building standards in the region rocked by the recent earthquake
7007443 severe power shortages across china especially in the manufacturing hub and export engine of guangdong are expected to add further pressure on exports in the second half of the year
7007444 scores of chinese air passengers have smashed computers and desks and clashed with police after a night stranded at an airport without accommodation state media said frustration at mysterious delays diversions and cancellations have at times boiled over into violence at chinese airports as passengers try to storm grounded aircraft and police are brought in to keep the peace there have also been cases in which passengers after delayed arrivals have refused to get off the planes in protest

7007446 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
7007447 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
7007448 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
7007449 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
7007450 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
7007451 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
7007452 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
7007453 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
7007454 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
7007455 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
7007456 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
7007457 why so serious letz put a smile on that face
7007458 i noticed it was really difficult for them to go to church
7007459 it was on our hearts something needed to be done
7007460 we want to reach those people for the lord jesus
7007461 we want them to feel like part of a community
7007462 our idea is a place where people who have special needs can serve the lord
7007463 people who are new to the area call me all the time
7007464 the two questions they ask the most are where to find a good school and where to find a good church program
7007465 the whole idea that they would even want to attempt this is so wonderful
7007466 as a parent of a special needs child youre always trying to make your child fit into the existing environment in this case theyre adjusting the environment for our kids
7007467 this is uncharted territory i dont know where were going but i trust that the lord will see us through
7007468 we believe that god has given us a mandate to share our love with the whole world when we discover a niche out there thats not being ministered to we try to step in and fill it
7007469 the trend is to acknowledge the gifts and challenges children and adults with disabilities bring to the congregation
7007470 i think our congregations have always wanted to help but they havent known how
7007471 its getting eye to eye with a person in a wheelchair instead of standing and talking down to them
7007472 all people of all faiths have a right to be honored and welcomed a right to worship study serve and learn

7007495 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry

7007502 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7007503 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7007504 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7007505 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7007506 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7007507 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7007508 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7007509 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7007510 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7007511 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7007512 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7007513 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7007514 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7007515 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7007516 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7007524 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7007525 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7007526 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7007527 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7007528 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7007529 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7007530 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7007531 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7007532 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7007533 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7007534 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7007535 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7007536 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7007537 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7007538 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7007539 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7007540 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7007541 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7007542 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7007543 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7007544 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7007545 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7007546 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7007547 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7007548 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7007549 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7007550 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7007551 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7007552 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7007553 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7007554 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7007555 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7007556 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7007557 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7007558 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7007559 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7007560 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7007561 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7007562 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7007563 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7007564 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7007565 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7007566 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7007567 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7007568 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7007569 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7007570 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7007571 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7007572 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7007573 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7007574 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

7007589 did not realize how cold blooded the younger generation of offender is they have been exposed to killing after killing they fully expect to get killed and they dont hesitate to shoot anybody including a police officer they can go from riding down the street saying what a beautiful day it is to killing in the next instant

7007602 the last time andrew fintoff batted like that with me was at edgbaston against australia in 2005 we gave him a new role at number five the man is a superstar i am fortunate to have a bloke like that who i can throw the ball to say knock over the stumps
7007603 we asked a lot of the players but we wont be resting on our laurels the team were brilliant we started off well and built a good foundation
7007604 and this is the stage where steve harmison belongs he should be playing in front of 30 000 40 000 50 000
7007605 we know they can hit the ball but if we get our execution right we should never be going for 98 in the last ten there is a feeling in the dressing room we can do a lot better
7007606 we pride ourselves on being better than that but england deserved their win they played with a lot more skill
7007607 when you cross the line you dont know where you are i am not looking across and just giving it everything down that last 200m
7007608 i had no idea whether i was first second or ninth until i crossed the line and looked across i had no idea where i finished i looked at the board and it said i was silver then it dropped me down to bronze but i have to be happy i came out to these olympics with the hope of getting two medals one of them gold and that is what i have done
7007609 physically the 1 000m final takes the edge off you but mentally as well that was the one i had the most pressure on me to win that was the one i really really wanted to win
7007610 it would have been great to have done the double today but coming into the race i was more jaded and these guys are world class athletes if i had finished without a medal today i would have been pretty upset and i say that off the back of being olympic champion i knew i had it in me to at least get another medal today

7007613 in my view they wont do aggressive counterinsurgency because they cant
7007614 weve warned the government that wed target police if the army did not stop operations against us
7007615 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
7007616 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
7007617 as the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7007618 what i was attempting to be but not very artfully was complimentary
7007619 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7007620 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food

7007623 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7007624 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7007625 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7007626 we have to strengthen the national unity based on full equality among people from the himal pahad terai and the madhes
7007627 there are high expectations from the public from the new government
7007628 he added rachanda who is also the chairman of the cpn maoists said that the new government will strengthen democracy
7007629 i want to extend full commitment towards modern democratic principles like multi party competition period elections rule of law
7007630 our attention will be concentrated on addressing socio economic issues such as poverty unemployment and so on we will work to bring about modern industrial economy for which private public partnership model will be followed
7007631 the industrial peace will be maintained by improving relations between labour and employers
7007632 this government also has huge challenges we need the support and cooperation from army police administration international community and general public to meet the challenges
7007633 that depends on how big fannie and freddie blow up
7007634 the problem is weve got questions we dont have answers
7007635 theres not protection for shareholders of common or preferred shares
7007636 even if any rescue effort gives a priority to the federal government that still makes fannie and freddie more solvent
7007637 when the price of oil has fallen by more than 20 percent and other commodities from steel and aluminum to corn and wheat have all fallen in price significantly it represents a cushion for the economy
7007638 it is one of the few supports that we have in the economy right now
7007639 the fiscal stimulus provided extra money that helped people get through that period where commodities were at their peak
7007640 the fundamentals of the labor market are still getting worse asset prices are falling credit is contracting all of these things should be negative for consumer spending
7007641 the good news is that lower oil prices puts more money in consumer pockets
7007642 the bad news is that it could be signaling a global slowdown
7007643 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
7007644 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
7007645 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
7007646 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
7007647 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
7007648 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
7007649 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7007650 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
7007651 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
7007652 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
7007653 theres nothing like that sort of industrial sized company thats still doing everything in house
7007654 i could do it with a phone call but it dilutes the brand the image of the company the product
7007655 beyond that we need the work here why ship it off someplace else
7007656 studies that weve done suggest that our market is about eight times what were producing right now so were way behind the eight ball
7007657 unconcerned with the safety or legal rights of limestone or the pecan grove residents and wanting to build its condominiums as quickly and economically as possible bartonplace began multiple repeated trespasses into limestones airspace with the boom of its tower crane
7007658 bartonplace condominium and the pecan grove park are working together to attempt to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement concerning construction matters both parties are optimistic that a mutually acceptable resolution will be achieved shortly
7007659 being sent on behalf of both bartonplace and pecan grove park
7007660 when bartonplace was approved neighbors in pecan grove were very upset of course

7007671 although the indians can fill the dam between june 21 and aug 31 they can only do so by releasing at least 55 000 cusecs downstream we made a call to the indian indus basin water treaty commissioner who promised to get back after checking the facts from irrigation authorities in occupied kashmir
7007672 but it certainly was a violation of the indus basin water treaty as pakistan had always feared when the indians were building the dam
7007673 inflow in the chenab river has gone down to 20 000 cusecs on friday against its historic low of 35 000 cusecs
7007674 when such cases verbal abuse are reported we can only forward it to the education department for further action
7007675 however it would be difficult to charge a teacher suspected of racially abusing a student unless there is strong supporting evidence and witnesses who are willing to testify in court

7007677 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes
7007678 so whether or not you like developing for that platform if theyve got millions of people connected to that platform and buying their games you have to take it seriously
7007679 theyre in the race now so weve got to re evaluate that for what it is

7007683 the criminals came with a speed boat they parked at the river bank and immediately entered a waiting bus at the beach straight to the bank and after their attack they also returned to the beach and took off the robbery did not even last up to 30 minutes it was like a commando movie
7007684 the war against terror has to be pursued through a co operative effort between afghanistan pakistan the north atlantic treaty organisation nato and the us unfortunately there was no chemistry between general r pervez musharraf and afghan president hamid karzai which did not facilitate co operation between the two countries i think we will see a more co operative phase after musharraf
7007685 i do not think induction of nato or american troops on the pakistani side is even something that anybody seriously considers

7007690 if i could wave a wand and the lord said i could solve one problem i would solve the energy crisis thats the single most consequential problem we can solve its what you have to do to get greenhouse gases under control
7007691 i personally believe that the single most important step we can take to resume a leadership role in international climate change efforts would be to make real progress toward a domestic emissions reduction regime for too long we have abdicated the responsibility to reduce our own emissions the largest single source of the problem we face today we have the worlds largest economy with the highest per capita emissions rather than leading by example we have retreated from international negotiations

7007694 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
7007695 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at sen obamas campaign
7007696 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7007697 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7007698 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7007699 we recognize that there has been a change in the executive office in philadelphia
7007700 but the view of the current director of commerce for the city does not affect or undermine the legitimate exercise of the authority reposed in the former director of commerce
7007701 were grateful to the supreme court for ruling in our favor
7007702 the city law department is studying the opinion and doing an internal analysis and until theyre done we dont know what else it means for the city
7007703 this is not the end in any way shape or form there are many more issues to be resolved
7007704 the casinos are bad for the city and mayor nutter and gov rendell still want these things off the riverfront
7007705 were just hoping the city doesnt give us any more stumbling blocks and the permits start to go through
7007706 but were still planning on meeting with the governor and the mayor and other government officials to discuss our project
7007707 i believe that the city acted properly in revoking a license which it had no authority to have conferred
7007708 our school does its best to train them to be professional to join in the olympics
7007709 the sports schools in some ways are a metaphor for chinese culture as a whole
7007710 american athletes theres a story about some kid in the middle of idaho and they started running
7007711 in china everybody seems to have the same story they were identified when they were 4 because they had long arms or double jointed elbows and then theyre incorporated into this little system that is designed to build champions
7007712 our system is designed for the people with passion and talent but ours is a much more organic process theirs is much more centrally organized china is a country run by engineers
7007713 thats been one of the dangers of this system they are really left to their own devices without skills without an education
7007714 they are denied their childhood in pursuit of this magical goal the nation will achieve its glory by tapping them like being tapped for the armed forces
7007715 i dont think its a coincidence that in china the chinese term for a retired athlete is the same as for a retired serviceman veteran
7007716 i did this without her permission and it was wrong
7007717 this is a man obsessed with taking a woman down
7007718 shocking and shows the true lack of remorse which the judge should take into consideration at sentencing
7007719 he continues his attack on the victim with unfounded implications
7007720 larry mendte like all cbs3 employees was treated professionally and fairly during his tenure here his allegations are totally without merit
7007721 to your knowledge is everything he said accurate and correct
7007722 we will not make a specific recommendation as to what sentence the court should impose
7007723 are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty as charged
7007724 i do not intend to do anything at this time until i hear the judges sentence
7007725 what were going to do regarding larry and his employer
7007726 the writer of the anonymous letter had to be aware of the suggestion for community service by the district attorneys office and of lanes resistance to the suggestion

7007734 i think he has played very well in the olympic tournament
7007735 hes played very well today as he normally does in his position and i knew that he could probably be the deciding factor
7007736 i think it the game had been played in another part of the day it would have been very different
7007737 we tried to make sure that we didnt get uptight just too play our own game
7007738 we wanted to play with intelligence and move the ball around and not run around so much we wanted the ball to do the work
7007739 no team has actually played at noon since we started this tournament
7007740 it affected both countries and most players didnt perform to their level because of the heat but we didnt make the rules they said play the game at 12 oclock which i dont think wasnt a good idea
7007741 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
7007742 dr thaksin has been really open about this he has said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing
7007743 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
7007744 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle
7007745 the truth of it is this club is not going to go out of business this club is not bankrupt were moving forward

7007759 this demolition is a unique situation and as far as we are aware nowhere else in the world has anyone sought to bring down similar structures that sit so close to a major highway viaduct
7007760 our priority is for the safety of road users and given the close proximity of the towers to the southbound carriageway of the m1 these closures are essential
7007761 once the demolition has taken place we will carry out a series of checks to ensure that there has been no damage to the viaduct which in itself may take several hours

7007794 ma aldil delle frasi fatte che una donna vuole sentirsi dire correggetemi se sbaglio penso che non c bisogno di essere degli studiosi per far felice una donna no basta solo lamore e una volta tanto basta solo far parlare il cuore e dire qualcosa di carino ricordandosi sempre che il cuore a parlare perch lamore in fondo solo un incontro di emozioni nate pure e vitali nel nostro profondo e siccome penso che le donne vadano adorate e corteggiate ogni giorno e che ogni giorno vadano premiate per tutto quello che le donne fanno per noi maschietti per rendere loro il nostro grazie basta solo far parlare il cuore e allora si che una donna sar felice

7007802 its about a person who naively does his best whenever he can hes innocent and he means well and hes dying because of it he knows he doesnt stand a chance but he still tries because if theres any genuine sentiment left in the world the underdog will somehow succeed in the end
7007803 i thought it might have been about a guy who is just a little too nice and idealistic about life and always gets squashed by the nasty people

7007834 made sure that passengers on the protected bus were canadian citizens therefore they targeted the bus and it is not as the apostates claim that we are targeting our brothers muslim workers
7007835 number of canadian people killed or wounded is still unknown
7007836 we are choosing our targets carefully and we are always careful with your blood we do not target the innocent
7007837 as usual they were demanding for money they said we should give them n50 million but we told them that we could not get that kind of money and that as true sons of ilaje we should be concerned about our people
7007838 they told us that they were not financially empowered and that they needed assistance they also threatened to destroy oil installations in the area both onshore and offshore but we told them that we would look into their demands and we pacified them on their threat to destroy installations
7007839 we have decided to go into investigation and we have discovered that some people are behind the scene and necessary security agencies had been briefed and they have started investigating we are optimistic that those behind the scene will be apprehended we were not tortured we had a very useful time with them
7007840 when we saw the situation which could have been avoided had the osopadec team followed our security measures we radioed men of the amphibious brigade of the nigerian army for reinforcement and we got some marine police to do a coordinated rescue mission
7007841 an embarrassment to my person and the security formation in my area of operation
7007842 the nsas visit to the national assembly has to do with the motion on nigerdock that was alleged to be engaged in arms deals
7007843 the invitation is for them to brief the leadership it is an allegation and has not been proved
7007844 i am not aware of that the role of nigerdock is ship building and allied services nigerdock is suspected to have abused that we are not aware of any litigation on that issue we are just abiding by the resolution of the house
7007845 we have not found anything wrong in the purchase of those vehicles the management of the national assembly executed the contracts for the purchase of the vehicles
7007846 cars do not belong to the committees but the management of the national assembly
7007847 358 members sat and took this decision all of us sat in executive session and members raised the issue and it was taken
7007848 you people have to be sympathetic to us we are asking you to show some concern there is no hanky panky we know what the senate did in their own
7007849 it is being handled by the speaker and the leadership and when he resumes he will answer all that
7007850 358 members sat and took this decision all of us sat in executive session and members raised the issue and it was taken
7007851 necessary security agencies have been briefed and they have started investigating we are optimistic that those behind this will be apprehended
7007852 its a system that holds about four litres of water that we tidy up and put underneath the hood and hook up to your engine and it makes your engine run on water
7007853 the system has been in production for 100 years probably people trying to make it work
7007854 its a chemical that you mix with the water that takes hydrogen out of the water which goes into your motor and gives you a clean burn our system is fully computer ized so your vehicle works together with the system it doesnt cause any damage to the motor your engine will run cooler which means your engine will have a longer life it also gives you a cleaner burn as soon as we install the system your car is no longer pro ducing carbon monoxide youre put ting out oxygen
7007855 when you take a guy from here to the airport you show him that the es calade burns 13 litres of gas from here to there then i turn the switch on for my system drive back the same mile age and burn two litres this is when you get peoples attention
7007856 you still put gasoline in the tank but your vehicle is burning very little gas and you only change your oil half as often it runs on hydrogen mixed with fuel
7007857 its better for the environment better for your car and it actually provides more power
7007858 our machine works with the computer of your vehicle the signal that comes from your o2 sensor tells our system how much hydrogen to create how much hydrogen to go into your combustion chamber i can tune it up to the level where youre burning very very little fuel up to 68 kilometres per litre in a honda accord
7007859 generally speaking if this added component caused damage to a cov ered component it would void the war ranty
7007860 i would hesitate to work on it and if there was any problem with it id sug gest it go back to the installer i wouldnt want to touch it just because of the possibility of damage to the vehi cle
7007861 there are va pour injection systems around and weve installed them they improve mileage five or 10 per cent but nothing like these claims

7007865 the biggest problem here is that it looks bad for coldfusion the first print magazine dedicated to it has left the building
7007866 the very fact that theyre moving the magazine from coldfusion an adobe product to silverlight a microsoft product can and will be used against coldfusion
7007867 the magazines were jammed full of advertising and the website has been absolutely abysmal for ages with auto play pop up videos
7007868 many have already commented on the cfdj announcement this weekend and every post i have read has correctly seen this for what it is sour grapes
7007869 only challenge while serving the cf community was to deal with some members of that very same community
7007870 people like corfield and dinowitz could not stand any sort of advertisement in cfdj they wanted their magazine delivered for free and hated the adverts that made this possible for them as if they were two characters from the dr zhivago movie
7007871 sys con is a printing company they are not interested in community support they are not interested in language advancement they are interested in money they are interested in enough money to print a magazine give it away to thousands and still make a profit looking over the number and cost of ads in their magazine they must want a big profit and those advertising dollars are partially guaranteed by adobes support
7007872 my question is if adobe does not care about their own community or their own language advancement why should they expect an outside magazine publisher to do this job for them and at no cost

7007892 the nation will be enhanced by the constitutional recognition it accords indigenous peoples because governments need to be made accountable in their dealings with aboriginal peoples
7007893 they need to justly and constructively engage via negotiation on the alleviation of the disastrous health education and social ills bedevilling indigenous australians and embark courageously in dialogue on constitutional recognition beyond a preamble

7007895 fay will be near or over the gulf coast of the western florida panhandle today and tonight and near or over the gulf coast of mississippi and alabama on sunday
7007896 fay is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches across the western portion of the northern florida peninsula the florida panhandle southwestern georgia and the southern half of both mississippi and alabama with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches possible
7007897 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
7007898 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage

7007917 their statements might have helped us but most of it was clear from the beginning
7007918 it was blatantly robbing me of getting into the semi finals its one thing i hate about this sport that the judges can control peoples lives like this take points away and do whatever they want
7007919 it wasnt just that point she got warnings for going back the whole fight she attacked just once and thats the only time she scored shes twice olympic champion but shes definitely not better than me
7007920 klar wollen wir gewinnen aber von der tabellenf hrung zu reden ist absoluter k se wir haben in der vergangenen saison gesehen wie wenig das wert sein kann

7007922 es macht keinen sinn sich nach ein oder zwei spielen neu zu positionieren

7007927 it is all right to come in and play a game but how will he react after it
7007928 i am fully aware he has got his thing on september 5 and it is highly unlikely joey will be involved with us beforehand
7007929 if he was fit enough and looked strong enough and put himself up for selection that way i would play him before then
7007930 theres a warning that this may cause slow down and effect gameplay
7007931 the round course is unraceable so we have had to abandon the two mile race and the mile and a half race
7007932 which ever of the other races has the biggest field we will divide to give us six races
7007933 we have had a dry night and the forecast is promising and although the straight course still has to improve we are going to give it 24 hours so it has every chance
7007934 i said last week i wouldnt have to lower the standards
7007935 however the quality players that i was looking to bring here may not be the ones who im chasing
7007936 we need to get numbers in i said after we lost to blackburn last week that we needed six or seven players
7007937 with the time left before the deadline it doesnt look as if we will be able to get that many
7007938 i think you could see coming in on the bus before the galway quarter final we saw croke park in the distance and it got the blood going

7007942 we all have to hold our hands up and take the blame having the back door shouldnt be an excuse for the simple fact that youre playing cork in a munster final
7007943 we always said from day one we wanted to go the direct route not to be messing about with back door games we wanted to go the whole way
7007944 but after defeat to cork we said then this is it we have to look at ourselves in the mirror and really concentrate and see where were going this year

7007953 there are other players to discuss as well im fairly relaxed about it but i will know more when we sit down
7007954 these things happen the main thing at the end of the day is that it will be sorted

7007960 no one had won three premier league titles on the run and we did that but four hasnt and no one has ever retained the champions league those are the targets this season thats the challenge
7007961 we certainly have the potential to do three and then four its all about whether you have the hunger and desire because weve proved we have the quality

7007970 peter burgoyne was someone people have been doubting for a fair time i thought he showed what he can do hes playing on ball against some pretty good players and he ripped them apart
7007971 he started on the bench he showed his willingness to run hard to tackle to win clearances hard ball gets kicked goals displayed all the want that he wants to be here next year
7007972 i think thats what our supporters our football staff and even our players were looking forward to him displaying
7007973 it was really poor really poor not competitive enough for long enough that would be in our top three or four really poor efforts for the whole year
7007974 they probably shouldve kicked more goals if their accuracy was better im sure the game wouldve blown out a lot further than it did

7008001 we can confirm that an incident did take place police are investigating and we will work closely with them to resolve this
7008002 i saw three police cars arrive outside the clinic and some police officers go into the clinic
7008003 i thought maybe one of the patients had got violent
7008004 there was a reliance van parked outside and later on i saw another smaller reliance van turn up
7008005 there were police officers around for a couple of hours they were walking up and down different lanes but i didnt know what they were doing
7008006 your conduct was extremely serious and carried out for no good reason
7008007 we would advise the public not to approach this individual but instead contact police immediately
7008008 if the police have waited six days then they cant be surprised why they are facing questions over why it took so long
7008009 its for the police to answer the charge of why theyve been slow they have a responsibility to flag up these kind of incidents to the public as quickly as possible you never know what someone like this might do
7008010 six days is too long what happened on sunday was every womans worst nightmare
7008011 by making the public aware potential witnesses who may have a small but significant piece of information know to come forward when its still fresh in their mind
7008012 our primary concern is public safety and that is paramount in our thoughts when it comes to getting information to the wider public
7008013 when we do release details of a crime or incident we must be entirely satisfied that the information is accurate in order that we do not mislead people or cause unnecessary alarm
7008014 at the same time we also have to consider the implications of releasing that information from an investigative point of view
7008015 such is the nature of many enquiries that it may take some time for the full details of an offence to emerge and on those occasions it is necessary to be confident about the facts before releasing information
7008016 while we understand the concerns of the public and appreciate their assistance we would also ask that they understand the sensitive nature of some of our investigations requires a carefully considered approach
7008017 when what became the city chambers were built in the 18th century the closes were all levelled off and sealed from above leaving shops and rooms below intact the public is now able to visit this subterranean part of the city but instead of being able to appreciate how people then lived they have to go along with a disneyfied haunted house experience
7008018 in response to sir seans comments we challenge him to put his money where his mouth is
7008019 we invite him to visit the real mary kings close and if he is still unimpressed we will donate 1000 to his chosen charity providing he is prepared to match or better this amount to our chosen charity the sick kids friends foundation at the royal hospital in edinburgh if he is impressed
7008020 we also think he must have forgotten the fact that he has made millions out of dramatising fiction when we are merely dramatising fact
7008021 we look forward to hopefully welcoming him and revealing a very real history connected to the sites amazing past and perhaps even telling him something different about his beloved home city
7008022 before you offer a credit card facility you need to operate with a bank that will underwrite that
7008023 its a slow process and its slower now banks worldwide are not taking much in the way of chances
7008024 the process of getting insured takes longer it doesnt mean that it is not going to happen but it will take a lot longer
7008025 ukio bankas is continuing with plans to open its first uk branch in edinburgh we are currently working through the administrative formalities by adapting our products services and systems to the uk
7008026 we are focusing on being able to deliver our services to the highest standard when we do open and look forward to being able to announce more news in future
7008027 i am concerned that at a time when edinburghs world heritage site status is potentially under threat that we are not being more vigilant in policing breaches in the rules
7008028 this massive banner is completely out of keeping with the surrounding area and should be removed immediately no commercial entity should be above planning and advertising regulations
7008029 the fringe already encourages the performers to be environmentally friendly but the difficulty is enforcement
7008030 these are independent companies but they all want to be a part of the fringe and they currently pay for inclusion in the fringe programme
7008031 what i would like to see is some kind of eco charter drawn up which the companies have to agree to in order to get their place in the programme which would cover the issue of flyers
7008032 i also think we need to discuss other ways in which these shows can advertise because it is questionable what the benefit of flyers is to them and perhaps there is a more sustainable way they can promote themselves
7008033 we always recommend that fringe artists use recyclable paper when producing flyers and with the support of the council large recycling bins have been provided on royal mile so fringe goers can recycle
7008034 the vast majority of performers use paper flyers and we are always willing to work closely with the council to make sure that we minimise waste
7008035 it is great that we now have these recycling containers on the high street but when companies are using laminated plastic flyers or all plastic flyers it is a real problem
7008036 these companies come from all over the world and we need to ensure that they do not leave edinburgh with a big environmental mess to clean up
7008037 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
7008038 our methods have the potential for providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
7008039 the orbital radiuses of bd pairs are cut off above about 15 aus bd pairs with greater distances are the exception
7008040 according to the classical model there ought not to be these differences
7008041 according to this both brown dwarfs and stars ought to emerge from interstellar clouds of gas which become concentrated because of the attraction of their mass but if this was the case these celestial bodies should behave in similar ways
7008042 for this we analysed the masses of newly born stars
7008043 this revealed a jump in the distribution of mass which makes the division in the stellar population apparent
7008044 from the size of the preserved bones we estimated that omo i was tall and slender most likely around 510
7008045 taken together the remains show that these early modern humans were much like the people in southern ethiopia and the southern sudan today
7008046 most of the anatomical features of omo are like modern humans only a few features are similar to more primitive hominids including neanderthals and homo erectus
7008047 the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure
7008048 the big problem was keeping the markers in place the little ones kept on pulling them off with their trunks
7008049 the arsenic concentrations reported are worrisome but the risk assessment is complex
7008050 rice bran solubles are not the only way of getting nutrients to malnourished children
7008051 if aid agencies want to go down the bran solubles route why not wheat oat or barely bran solubles all these crops have ten times less total arsenic than rice and are just as nutrient rich
7008052 the idea is to grow one of these magic thicknesses at low temperature and then heat up the sample slowly to room temperature
7008053 this work represents a key step forward in producing a device to focus helium atoms
7008054 the remaining step is to combine the high reflectivity with a carefully deformed surface in order to create a focused atomic spot that is still quite a challenge
7008055 we have this pattern now of finding temples close to the water or under the water in this most recent case
7008056 these were probably made as part of a very elaborate ritual everything is related to death life and human sacrifice
7008057 caves are natural portals to other realms which could have inspired the mayan myth they are related to darkness to fright and to monsters
7008058 im sure the myths came first and the caves reaffirmed the broad time and space myths of the mayans
7008059 they believed in a reality with many layers the portal between life and where the dead go was important to them

7008063 if you take the whole gamut of threats from state sponsored organisations to industrial espionage private individuals and malcontents youre talking about a remarkable number of attempted attacks on our system id say in the thousands
7008064 were building this house of cards at the moment connecting elements of our financial systems as well as the systems which control nuclear power or water distribution to the internet and its a very open environment

7008067 im just focusing now on getting my fitness levels back up to 100 per cent
7008068 after that we will see what players the manager brings in during the transfer market and what my role in the team could be
7008069 but this will be my second season at liverpool and hopefully i can take my game to the next level
7008070 we have a lot of exciting attacking players we know we can hurt teams when we attack but we also need to get it right defensively
7008071 its difficult to know where teams will end up this season but we have high expectations and playing these two teams will provide a good yardstick
7008072 we are interviewing people in south florida and we should close this out fairly quickly it did not come from tallahassee
7008073 we have excellent leads and we should close this out very quickly
7008074 is if you just use you bob and you bob as caricatures the truth is both of you acknowledge the world is more complicated
7008075 the economy has changed in the last 15 years and our understanding of economic policy has changed as well
7008076 and that means that what was appropriate in 1993 is no longer appropriate
7008077 i still would have probably made a slightly different choice than clinton did
7008078 i probably wouldnt have been as obsessed with deficit reduction
7008079 she had to think very practically about how do you make money
7008080 how does the system work that led me to have an orientation to ask hardheaded questions during my formative years there was still ideological competition between a social democratic or even socialist agenda and a free market milton friedman agenda i think it was natural for me to ask questions of both sides and maybe try to synthesize approaches
7008081 reagans central insight that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic with democratic policy makers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing that pie contained a good deal of truth
7008082 i like to think of him as a university of chicago democrat
7008083 ive never worked with a campaign that was more interested in what the research shows
7008084 this could be one of the biggest pieces of corporate welfare ever
7008085 the market is the best mechanism ever invented for efficiently allocating resources to maximize production
7008086 and i also think that there is a connection between the freedom of the marketplace and freedom more generally
7008087 weve probably done a better job of the last 20 years on the problems the market can solve than the problems the market cant solve were doing pretty well on the size of peoples houses and televisions and the like were not looking so good on infrastructure and education
7008088 the free market centrism of the clinton years to a revived push for european style social democracy
7008089 this is in many respects a deeply un american solution to the problems facing our country
7008090 one that would emphasize dependence over self sufficiency and bureaucratic condescension over self help
7008091 if you talk to warren hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
7008092 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
7008093 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth and i also think you want to instill that sense of self reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes
7008094 we all talk about apollo 11 but there were some pretty public pretty awful failures along the way
7008095 the united states didnt say well we had some failures
7008096 now thats the story now telling it elegantly low taxes smaller government the way the republicans have i think is more of a challenge
7008097 one just because i think it really captures where i was going with the whole issue of balancing market sensibilities with moral sentiment one of my favorite quotes is you know that famous robert f kennedy quote about the measure of our g d p
7008098 well ill send it to you because its one of the most beautiful of his speeches
7008099 counts special locks for our doors and the jails for those who break them
7008100 the health of our children the quality of their education or the joy of their play
7008101 i was interested to see what it was because ive worked with a team of people involved in monitoring and forecasting aphids those of greenfly and their relatives in this country
7008102 i looked at it with my team and we thought we could identify it down to the level of genus but we had no idea what the species was
7008103 he discovered that it was something that hadnt been described before
7008104 i had thought it would be rather nice to call it mindarus ebayi
7008105 unfortunately using flippant names to describe new species is rather frowned upon these days
7008106 this happened because we started to eat better food like eating more meat
7008107 did not make humans as smart as they are today
7008108 the same very boring stone tools for almost 2 million years
7008109 that they were being terminated and operations were to cease
7008110 it was very much a surprise both to the employees and as well as i believe local management
7008111 however due to the nature of the credit markets and inability to obtain necessary working and investment capital the company reached the point of being unable to meet its obligations
7008112 were in the process of getting the news out there that were here
7008113 thats a huge part of our business we go out and assess what they need
7008114 while we have no positive test for these products we felt we should take action
7008115 i could see if i was going to prive or club mansion on a saturday night for 1 000 ok but im going to applebees for a sit down with campaign volunteers for 35
7008116 im just simply going off of whats been done before in races in close knit communities like mine my parents have done it other candidates have done it
7008117 is not common in south florida where the districts are fairly small
7008118 when barack obama is able to lease a plane and rent vehicles left and right and federal candidates can spend in excess of several thousands of dollar in travel i dont have that luxury
7008119 if i am putting the wear and tear on my vehicle for the purpose of influencing the campaign i dont see it as odd or completely going against the grain
7008120 you dont pay separately for tires you dont pay separately for gas
7008121 i would find it difficult to see how a contribution from a campaign account to a scholarship would be for the purpose of influencing the results of an election
7008122 well be equipping six or seven classrooms with smart boards interactive white boards and wireless laptops
7008123 it will make us more efficient as we concentrate on education
7008124 they can only have them for genuine bona fide emergencies they must be off in the classroom and you cant use them in restrooms changing rooms and locker rooms because of camera capabilities
7008125 well be working with students to have them understand what it takes to open your own business
7008126 not only do you get a curriculum but you get a taste of people who own their own business
7008127 the hope is to change the culture and climate of the school
7008128 the usccb has taken great time and care to outline in detail the curricular context for the formation of children and youth within our church
7008129 we wish to follow their lead and expertise in this area in order to create the most excellent formation programming possible within our catholic schools
7008130 you identify strategies to support student learning so we can both work hard and smart
7008131 some strategies work better than others were working to identify those strategies as a focus of our professional development
7008132 with the global economy it is definitely the language that we need to continue to embrace in order to make our students competitive in the work force
7008133 well be bringing a number of classrooms cutting edge technology
7008134 it will help us to implement technology into our high school in terms of equipment and teacher training
7008135 we were able to put laptop computers and an overhead projector and smart boards in 15 classrooms with the extra money
7008136 students today are bombarded with technology they learn differently theyre wired differently theres so many different interactive type things they can do
7008137 ive been spending the summer getting to know people and some of the things that make this district what it is
7008138 were going to draft a plan for the entire district for the improvement of scores
7008139 we dont have to do that we just have to do that for the middle school but we want to be a step ahead
7008140 all of our students in grades 4 through 8 will have laptop computers and there will be one laptop for every two high school students
7008141 we want to deliver instruction through the latest technology to the kids
7008142 we hope we will become one of the leading technological districts in pennsylvania but were also embracing another culture thats becoming a world leader
7008143 parents will be able by mid year using name and password to log in and bring up their children and check their grades and attendance
7008144 it sends out phone messages or e mail messages to parents within minutes each person can have up to six numbers in the phone bank
7008145 we could have instantly sent messages to parents of high school students
7008146 within five to 10 minutes everyone would have been contacted
7008147 each child is assessed with the use of an electronic palm pilot
7008148 once theyre assessed theyre put into one of three different tiers intensive for those who are struggling the most strategic and benchmark for those reading at their level or higher its a way of addressing students reading needs
7008149 so you dont have a teacher going down on their own track
7008150 how can i expect her to stay with me anymore
7008151 shes not going to want to be intimate with a freak elephant man thats the way i saw myself
7008152 combined with the fact that returning vets are usually older and partnered this is having a devastating effect on relationships
7008153 the man will say i dont even feel like having sex anymore he has been conditioned to not feel emotions and may experience hypervigilance or anxiety when touched emotional detachment is a hallmark of ptsd
7008154 the first time you see the reflection of your changed body whether sitting in a wheel chair or severely disfigured because of facial burns it is shocking people who are not married look down and ask will anyone ever be interested in me if they are married they wonder will my partner still find me sexually attractive facing issues of body image and sexual self esteem are pretty universal
7008155 i knew that i definitely wanted to have more children and i knew that he was not interested in me and so a big red flag to me was well what did i do why does he not want to have sex why does he not want to touch my hand or why is he not asking me to get in the bed am i the only one that is feeling like i want in the bed
7008156 he had dreams that he didnt realize he was having
7008157 he was much more active during these dreams nothing that would keep me up but yes there was a part of him he couldnt control
7008158 this war can result in separate bedrooms and sexless loveless marriages 25 years down the road
7008159 many couples are resilient and their relationships last or may even be strengthened

7008175 there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section
7008176 there is no doubt that a recording error of some kind has occurred so where do these runs belong
7008177 it is all about the scoring an activity usually taken for granted
7008178 the bullying and adversity made him be stronger and work harder
7008179 michael may not have been able to focus in school but i saw a passion for swimming at such a young age

7008192 the war against terror has to be pursued through a co operative effort between afghanistan pakistan the north atlantic treaty organisation nato and the us unfortunately there was no chemistry between general r pervez musharraf and afghan president hamid karzai which did not facilitate co operation between the two countries i think we will see a more co operative phase after musharraf
7008193 i do not think induction of nato or american troops on the pakistani side is even something that anybody seriously considers
7008194 we have this pattern now of finding temples close to the water or under the water in this most recent case
7008195 these were probably made as part of a very elaborate ritual everything is related to death life and human sacrifice
7008196 caves are natural portals to other realms which could have inspired the mayan myth they are related to darkness to fright and to monsters
7008197 im sure the myths came first and the caves reaffirmed the broad time and space myths of the mayans
7008198 they believed in a reality with many layers the portal between life and where the dead go was important to them
7008199 there are stones huge columns and sculptures of priests in the caves

7008265 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7008266 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7008267 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7008268 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7008269 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7008270 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

7008307 it is the first time i have been into the olympic games probably because they are in beijing
7008308 there has been some amazing athletes particularly michael phelps the highlight for me has been the determination to do well and the amount of talent there
7008309 they are interested in chinas gold medals but they will not watch the whole programme only the highlights
7008310 they deserve the glory they made the effort and did the training
7008311 when i was little and living in southern china it was very poor especially under japanese occupation
7008312 but now i have noticed all the changes and the people in china are better off
7008313 its inside how you feel and i dont know how to express it
7008314 the most important part is letting the world know about china most of the time they dont see the true colours of china it is not always how the press shows it
7008315 there is an issue im not denying that but we just need more to time to sort it out china is a big country and there is a lot of educating and developing to do
7008316 the truth is i dont know what they are going to do after the olympics but i would like it to stay that way i would like to see the olympic spirit continue
7008317 many people dont know china very well and the opening ceremony was all about chinas history
7008318 the director just wanted to show the best of china to the rest of the world
7008319 the west views china as poor with no food they want to show the world that china is growing up they want to connect with the world
7008320 the chinese government has problems same as every country there are so many people and it is difficult to change quickly i think the olympics have shown they are trying

7008340 i cannot understand the fans disappointment with him his heart is with the club
7008341 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
7008342 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
7008343 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay
7008344 i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that
7008345 people have advisors and some clubs pay higher wages than we do we have to accept that
7008346 i have moments in my life where i want to rise above the limitations of words and depict an array of great and fascinating images of creation in wonderful colours and then the paintings just happen they are not landscapes portraits or still life paintings they are an attempt to portray gods love through the eyes of a person who is hungry to feel the love of god my paintings are symbols of a generation of spiritual people who are testament to the strength of gods love that is ever present in this world
7008347 though perhaps as a friendly gesture they could warn mr mccain of the dangers of mr hikinds extreme ideas
7008348 i personally want the democratic party and its nominee senator barack obama to have a worthy opponent not a person who accepts support from such an unworthy source as dov hikind
7008349 i was involved with rabbi kahane and have no regrets
7008350 ive always made it very clear i got involved when the issues were anti semitism jewish poor things that were in america
7008351 either ignorant or trying to sear me with a label which is a clear mccarthy tactic
7008352 i dont know where the governors going but hes going big places
7008353 hes young hes going to be around playing a role and talking this straight talk
7008354 ive been elected 13 times by a 90 percent democrat community of 150 000 jews and non jews im running for reelection this year as a proud democrat but not a blind one for me its about supporting people whom i think are best i support republicans and many democrats

7008364 het beeld van china in het buitenland is te negatief en klopt niet met de werkelijkheid
7008365 jij vindt het toch ook niet leuk als jouw land alsmaar negatief in de media komt
7008366 china wil meedoen op het wereldtoneel en daarvoor heeft het de goedkeuring van het westen nodig de westerse media spelen daarbij een belangrijke rol
7008367 dat ging voorbij aan alle verbeteringen die de overheid trof de moderne ontwikkelingen in de stad waarop de meeste mensen in peking juist heel erg trots zijn
7008368 de focus is verschoven van de chinese samenleving naar de sport en er is ruimte voor complimenten over de openingsceremonie bijvoorbeeld staatstelevisie cctv vertelde daar dan weer uitvoerig over hoe lovend de washington post was of cnn

7008413 complexity theory is a branch of mathematics that seeks to understand why certain problems are hard to compute
7008414 we know some problems are difficult but for many other problems that seem to be hard we cant rule out the possibility that there is some clever approach that makes them easy to compute
7008415 we may believe its inconceivable that a fast program for one of these problems can be found but we just cant be certain
7008416 there are no tools that actually prove how hard these are to compute and thats what we want to create
7008417 this will give our students the opportunity to be part of a highly demanding and inspiring academic effort
7008418 the collaboration will bring together some of the best minds in the field of computational complexity to stimulate new ideas and approaches to its increasingly difficult questions

7008457 this demolition is a unique situation and as far as we are aware nowhere else in the world has anyone sought to bring down similar structures that sit so close to a major highway viaduct
7008458 our priority is for the safety of road users and given the close proximity of the towers to the southbound carriageway of the m1 these closures are essential
7008459 once the demolition has taken place we will carry out a series of checks to ensure that there has been no damage to the viaduct which in itself may take several hours

7008465 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
7008466 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7008467 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
7008468 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
7008469 you shouldnt read too much into the team we pick for saturday or monday its a quick turnaround and well probably need literally every body we have
7008470 no player is 100 match fit because theyve not played regularly for three or four months thats why we werent as efficient at forest green as we were at lewes
7008471 its an incredible feeling to be olympic champion its been a long time coming
7008472 it was a fantastic race probably the most enjoyable i have ever had and i am really pleased not just for me but for my coach friends and family who have given me so much support
7008473 i put everything into this and i couldnt have done more
7008474 ive fallen off and got back up ive fallen off and got back up i gave it my heart and everything but today it wasnt good enough
7008475 i dug deep and gave it my best shot im 19 and there is more to come from me as an athlete but at the moment im hurting my back is sore and i think i have broken my hand
7008476 danny gives us positional and organisational powers on the pitch
7008477 we seem to be playing the teams who are on a high from last season and it does carry momentum this season
7008478 but i will know more when we sit down next wednesday i have not been party to these talks meaning i have not been in the room but i have been informed and dont see any reason why all these players whose contracts have got to certain stages why we cant secure all those players including james milner and steve harper
7008479 i can honestly say if it comes to january then the chances are he wont be staying but i dont think it will go to january i am not completely in the loop but i know a lot of what has gone on and we will have a better idea then
7008480 if he is playing for newcastle united and he is fit then they are entitled to call him now would i be entirely happy about it i suppose from a selfish point of view you would say it is a lot of games very quickly but if he is fit and gets called up we certainly will not pull him out
7008481 were just going to go out there and get the 3 points its going to be a tough game we all know that but we have a very strong team
7008482 its very early days yet andy mangan getting two goals helps his confidence and there are little plusses in every game weve got to keep adding to them
7008483 woking have had three defeats but their team is no worse than anybody elses
7008484 when we decided to build the stadium i wanted to anticipate the possibility of financial restrictions so i concentrated on youth i also felt the best way to create an identity with the way we play football to get players integrated into our culture with our beliefs our values was to get them as young as possible and to develop them together i felt it would be an interesting experiment to see players grow together with these qualities and with a love for the club
7008485 it was an idealistic vision of the world of football
7008486 it is very important to meet their needs inside the club the way we play the way we behave with success on the field and in financial rewards if you can achieve that as a club you can keep them together i dont feel at our club you have to make any other sacrifice than financial because all the other aspects are better at our club than anywhere else
7008487 if you want to be fair with everybody or try to be as fair as possible you could make the odd exception but you need a logic in the way you pay your players and in the way you structure the whole wages bill personally i dont think it is right to lose 100m and to play football i feel that the skill of a manager is to do the maximum with the resources he has and try to be successful i dont believe that 100m losses can last a long time it will not be accepted not only because it will implode if the benefactor pulls out
7008488 if you do not balance the books you go bankrupt and die i could push the club into big debt i go away with success and the guy who comes after me suffers for five years because he cannot buy a player any more and the club goes down the guy who comes after me has good players he can work with he has a healthy financial situation and he has a club in good shape that is part of management as well
7008489 it is more a status thing than the actual money
7008490 the player compares himself to other players he thinks are on the same level not because of the money more for the respect for his own quality that is where meeting their needs comes in money is only one fraction of the needs that a player has at a club on that front you can sometimes accept a small disadvantage knowing that the rest is superior
7008491 i feel if you come into a club as manager you have first to work out its specific qualities
7008492 for me arsenal is a club which tries to respect tradition style honesty fair play if you come in and behave like a gangster you will not last long the supporters will be the first ones not happy with that a club needs values if a club has no values you go nowhere
7008493 when you are very young you do not feel that the influence of your parents or your education is decisive
7008494 a trait of my parents i recognise in me is the belief that you work very hard and you shut up if you are good someone will see it you try to do as well as you can and if you are honest and you work hard you will be all right
7008495 when you are used to seeing teenagers together in good health to experience them together like this is difficult to take you do not expect them to be sick
7008496 what is very impressive is the team attitude to fight against cancer the children are brought together the parents are brought together what comes out of that unit is lets fight it together
7008497 you check that every day that the team is bonded you try always to make sure it is integrated it is never guaranteed and it is very fragile and vulnerable it can be upset by exterior factors or interior factors and can disintegrate very easily it is the skill of the manager to always assess it and to address the situation when needed a team is made of a collection of individuals sometimes a few individuals feel they do not need to put their energy into the team as much and think more about themselves that quickly has consequences for the team
7008498 it is natural the same culture gets together if you yourself met some english people in jamaica you will speak to them you will have dinner together you cannot fight against that because it is a lost fight if you have a dinner together you will choose the same kind of food it is a glue it is part of you what you can fight for is to keep the communication going inside the team and make sure this does not go into a clique situation
7008499 they were victims of the competition it is not a question of nationalities the premier league today is a competition among the players of the whole world at the top clubs it is a competition among the top players of the whole world of course that is detrimental to some english players and it will be tough for wilshere and lansbury but if they make it they are world stars and you do not have many world stars in any academy not now you can only recruit locally
7008500 you have to pause every 20 minutes as they cannot keep a longer focus but the big row in the olympics about the gymnast who they said was only 12 teaches you at 12 you can be technically at the top level in the world
7008501 to kick correctly the ball to put him in situations where he develops his skill the talent of a coach is to put an exercise to a player that he has to find the solution to if he does not you teach him to do it better if the exercise is too easy or too difficult he will not learn and he has to find it out for himself what makes football special is you have a billion techniques it is not like in tennis where you hit the ball
7008502 in football when you come to hit the ball you have someone pushing you on the top of your left shoulder and you still have to keep your balance and hit the ball right at the start your basic movements have to be right then you adapt
7008503 you know nothing has changed except the way to the emirates is slightly different to highbury if someone says can you show me london i say buy a good guidebook and do it on your own
7008504 ten years ago i said to my wife annie five more years and thats all and i am still here so now i do not want to make those statements any more i hope i will be strong enough to say one day thats it but i am more focused on beating fulham today than my longer future
7008505 i cannot imagine not working fishing in the morning is not so much what i like it is a trap this job you are under high pressure with big targets but you cannot imagine not having it that is not enough in itself you must enjoy it at the moment i enjoy it i am healthy and successful and i hope that lasts
7008506 it is difficult to find time to see them but there are jobs which are worse you have guys who leave for work on monday and come back on friday in my job i travel but the problem is not so much the quantity of time you spend with your family it is the quality that is where this job is more damaging you do not always give them the quality they deserve when you are at home because you are thinking of the next game
7008507 my wife a former basketball olympian likes watching football she watches all the games of arsenal at home she is not a fanatic but she likes watching sports no she does not have much choice
7008508 the most significant thing when you are sick is you are isolated
7008509 if you are sick tomorrow the first thing is you will lie in your bed thinking when will i be well again they have to face that for a year or longer to have support is wonderful
7008510 i feel jealous of the guys here i had no one to talk to i felt i was doing it all alone here teenagers can help each other
7008511 i believe a club has a social responsibility we are very conscious of that
7008512 this film has been modified from its original version it has been formatted to fit your screen
7008513 we are looking at something but if it doesnt come off then we will carry on as we are
7008514 thats not important what is important is that we had the meeting its clear that it was positive we needed to talk and clarify the situation for the future of the club all the problems have been resolved so we are now progressing and trying to improve the squad
7008515 republic of ireland assistant team manager liam brady has been discharged from beaumont hospital this afternoon flowing completion of his medical examinations
7008516 he has been given a clean bill of health and has told us he will return to work today when he will travel to london to be at the tottenham v sunderland match with marco tardelli
7008517 he was in great form and took a full part in the match
7008518 i saw him in the second half pacing up and down in the dressing room he was normal

7008521 i am married to a black american who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters
7008522 i had dated a lot of brothers who had this kind of reputation coming in so i figured he was one of those smooth brothers who could talk straight and impress people so we had lunch and he had this bad sports jacket and a cigarette dangling from his mouth and i thought ive been down this road before
7008523 even though my father depended on the assistance of a cane and eventually a motorised cart even though he was in pain he was never late and never complained
7008524 he did it every single day so he could send me and my brother to some of the best schools in the country his priority was to provide for his family and give his children the tools to succeed in life and he did
7008525 the black middle class is the most invisible unknown group in the country
7008526 there are millions and millions of people in it and yet we know nothing about them
7008527 i am always a little amazed at the response that people get when they hear from barack
7008528 a great man a wonderful man but still a man
7008529 i have some difficulty reconciling the two images i have of barack obama theres barack obama the phenomenon hes an amazing orator harvard law review or whatever it was law professor bestselling author grammy winner and then theres the barack obama that lives with me in my house and that guys a little less impressive for some reason this guy still cant manage to put the butter up when he makes toast secure the bread so that it doesnt get stale and his five year old is still better at making the bed than he is
7008530 the first time in my adult life im really proud of my country
7008531 we have become a nation of struggling folks who are barely making it every day

7008542 in the beginning of any media format a lot of content is oriented toward men
7008543 as more content is created for the female market women become dominant and drive most of the ad dollars

7008551 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults
7008552 its a family of faults and that can contribute to the severity of an earthquake

7008582 we have now completed enrollment in two pivotal trials with over 12 000 women participating if the trials are successful we expect to be in a position to file marketing applications with regulatory authorities including a new drug application with the u s food and drug administration in 2010
7008583 there is an urgent medical need for effective treatment options for non small cell lung cancer because current treatment strategies have only a minimal impact on survival
7008584 the majority of patients who are newly diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer have locally advanced or metastatic disease that is currently incurable we look forward to evaluating the potential of mapatumumab plus chemotherapy to offer a new approach to the first line treatment of this deadly disease
7008585 a growing body of preclinical data suggests that combining hgs etr1 with chemotherapy agents could be an effective approach to the treatment of a number of malignancies including non small cell lung cancer
7008586 hgs etr1 is the most advanced of any product in development that targets the trail apoptotic pathway the nsclc study is one of three ongoing hgs trials designed to evaluate combinations of hgs etr1 with chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of specific cancers

7008590 i signed silvestre because he was the kind of player who can complete our team in every aspect of what we needed a left footed player experience at the back and some maturity as well
7008591 the thinking is that he has a great team attitude and we are a bit light in terms of experience in the dressing room so he can help us on that front
7008592 we have to make sure we do not make calamitous defensive errors and that arsenal have to work hard for their goals

7008615 i worked closely with both man ray and andy warhol and there is just no comparison man ray was a true genius who made significant art discoveries right to the day he died at 86 andy was creatively dead the last twenty years of his life andy stole all the credit from paul morrissey for the films they made together andy had at best only a painters understanding of photography with his early work if andy was a genius it was by fluke

7008619 local adaptation of the imci guidelines with appropriate training and supervision could allow safe and effective management of severe pneumonia especially if compliance with referral is difficult because of geographic financial or cultural barriers
7008620 we welcome a substantial increase in investment in controlled trials in developing countries to address crucial gaps in information such as correct case management of severe pneumonia in children with hiv infection and in health policy and systems research to identify effective ways to improve and scale up implementation of interventions against pneumonia
7008621 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
7008622 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away
7008623 automatic mental associations predict future choices of undecided decision makers

7008625 facial transplantation could be successful in the short term but the procedure is not without complications this case suggests facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily integrate themselves back into society
7008626 our case confirms that face transplantation is surgically feasible and effective for the correction of specific disfigurement due in this case to a genetic disorder long term follow up is needed to assess the risks linked to the immunogenicity of allogenic composite tissues particularly as regards life expectancy following this initial success other patients are currently being assessed
7008627 to answer the many technical functional immunological and psychological questions raised by face transplantation
7008628 the definition of the best indications eg trauma malformations benign tumours burns will also greatly benefit from this cooperation the international registry on hand and composite tissue transplantation would be an ideal forum to help solve these challenges and define new indications our main objective is to give back a normal life to disfigured patients
7008629 this smithsonian contribution to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is a direct result of catherine potvins foresight in adapting her studies of plant carbon uptake to panamas cultural and economic reality and represents a very positive step in support of our basic research on the impact of global change on tropical forests and water availability and our climate partnership with hsbc the world wildlife fund earthwatch and the climate group
7008630 i hope that our model for community based carbon offset will show that the carbon market can directly benefit local people while helping panama to remain an international leader in the global effort to reduce emissions from deforestation under the united nations framework convention for climate change
7008631 as the community replants deforested areas with native species we replant traditions vital to the conservation of our way of life this is a very positive step toward confronting the ongoing devastation of natural resources and protecting the environment in the region
7008632 the ipeti pilot project if conducted in compliance with all of the regulations required by international carbon credit markets and local legislation will be our focus as we develop national standards and propose future projects in the context of the world banks forest carbon partnership facility pilot activities
7008633 while many americans are living paycheck to paycheck to effectively protect ourselves for the future we need to start saving paycheck to paycheck
7008634 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal
7008635 we plan on pay raises work bonuses and other monies to come forward but we cannot be thinking this way we need to start saving money every day
7008636 planning too far in advance not only makes consumers over optimistic regarding how much they will save but it also makes them behave in more aggressive and risk seeking ways in other financial arenas
7008637 the easiest thing to do is to be a smarter consumer and make spending and saving decisions thoughtfully on a daily basis that extra cup of coffee every morning carpooling with a co worker and cutting out the extras
7008638 the harder and more prudent thing to do is to mindfully take a portion of your earnings each pay period and save it in the bank
7008639 americans cant solely depend on their retirement plan it will be painful but like that mortgage or car loan payment we need to start thinking about a savings transfer every pay period
7008640 the effects of time frames on personal savings estimates savings behavior and financial decision making
7008641 the struggle against high resistant agents cannot be won with the previous means such as the use of new antibiotics and intensive disinfection measures we must break new grounds in order to reduce the potential danger for our patients
7008642 scientific tests performed by several independent working groups have shown beyond doubt that copper surfaces can efficiently kill bacteria and other germs
7008643 humanity has had positive experience with the hygienic effect of copper for thousands of years
7008644 against the backdrop of the current problems in the health care system the dki has now taken the first steps in order to apply these properties of copper in a modern hospital
7008645 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
7008646 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
7008647 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
7008648 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
7008649 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
7008650 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
7008651 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
7008652 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way
7008653 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
7008654 as long as the gain outweighs the cost the feature will survive the fruit flys color pattern is a paradigm for understanding how to use the same sets of genes in different sexes to come up with different features
7008655 right now theres not much you can do about the vector so it is all a matter of management
7008656 the wheat curl mite is found on volunteer wheat and many different grasses and is blown in the air by winds
7008657 very rarely did you find triticum without wheat streak mosaic
7008658 i really need to survey everywhere i can this year
7008659 in calculating the counties with wheat acreage infected in the northern panhandle early diagnosis could save as much as 9 million for producers by eliminating wasted irrigations
7008660 we werent testing for triticum at that time so it is also a factor to be investigated
7008661 we have the potential to save producers billions of dollars in wasted irrigation and fertilizer costs
7008662 the main time people irrigate in this area is in the late spring and summer during grain fill and heading
7008663 we want to catch it before then if not in the fall
7008664 and if all you girls out there think that some prince is going to show up in a limo and sweep you off your feet and youll live a happily ever after pimple free life i have two words for you as if
7008665 not only was i a loser because i had zero interest in anything prom related but it was my responsibility to warn the students at castle heights about how society was trying to brainwash them
7008666 this is incredibly exciting science frontier science and its great to see australian researchers leading the way
7008667 together well be able to access biological models that have been developed for specific research projects combining our technical resources means we can spend more time actually doing the research that will make a real difference in our efforts to combat diseases
7008668 australia has a wealth of talent in medical research spread across a number of institutions each organisation has its own strengths in different areas
7008669 the apn will allow our resources to be combined and greatly enhance australias research capacity
7008670 the ability to comprehensively sequence any persons genome is the type of quantum leap needed to usher in an age of personalized medicine where healthcare providers can use an individuals genetic code to prevent diagnose and treat diseases
7008671 a new generation of sequencing technologies is stepping in front of the already impressive technologies that enabled initial sequencing of the human genome
7008672 we continue to seek further innovation to enable routine sequencing of genomes to advance scientific knowledge and healthcare
7008673 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
7008674 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
7008675 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
7008676 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well
7008677 we saw that sporting events can be fertile ground for illegal alcohol sales and that the seats provide an especially high risk environment at events that every year attract an average of 130 million people
7008678 we know already that theres a link between alcohol use and problem behaviors among fans
7008679 but theres more that sports stadiums can do to prevent sales to people who are clearly drunk if people are intoxicated we dont need them to consume more alcohol
7008680 combining thousands of fans with significant alcohol sales could be construed as a recipe for some serious problems like increased instances of violence and drunk driving
7008681 given the results of this study stadium management and local and state elected officials may want to consider banning or restricting alcohol sales in the stands at sporting events as some stadiums have already done
7008682 however if such a policy is not politically feasible in a particular stadium vendors in the stands may need to receive additional training regarding responsible service of alcohol training that could include how to check age identification and more clearly recognize signs of obvious intoxication
7008683 in addition law enforcement and community groups need to actively monitor and work with stadiums to promote responsible alcohol service at these events
7008684 were trying to identify in the trichoplax genes that are also found in other animals our genome and the fruit fly genome and so on
7008685 a big effort and a big investment and so we have to choose carefully
7008686 the motivation for choosing this animal was its phylogenetic position
7008687 a tiny little pancake of cells you can barely see without a microscope
7008688 and theyre extremely simple about as simple as you can be just a disc of cells thats two layers thick
7008689 well thats one of the main questions im going after now that im setting up my own lab
7008690 is there a reason theyre together and if they get separated by a mutation does that disrupt some mechanism of gene regulation or cause some other problem for an organism
7008691 but its a very clear question and ive decided to try to find the answer to that

7008717 if you dont stop whining ill give you something to whine about
7008718 pay no attention to those idiots if you werent pretty i wouldnt tease you so
7008719 i was very happy because from the beginning i could make the race at the front and set the speed i thought the polish rider would have been stronger after the first downhill i saw i could pass her and take the lead
7008720 when you ride your bike at the olympic games you cant play safe
7008721 its not a question of riding a careful race you dont think you just go because if you dont if you lose its four years of regrets
7008722 there was no better way for china to convey their history and culture this is why i became a teacher
7008723 you can never underestimate just how significant music and arts can be in helping children learn and solve complex problems
7008724 it is the responsibility of all educators to teach literacy and numeracy and the arts play a key role in doing that
7008725 its wonderful to see someone who loves teaching music became a department chair where she can make a difference
7008726 i hope to continue the growth in both numbers of students who benefit from the arts and program quality in course offerings experiences and accessibility
7008727 more and more students are becoming involved in festivals and art competitions enhancing their learning process and often providing a sense of belonging and a feeling of connection to their school and community thats why i love arts and i want all my students to share this passion
7008728 im a runner myself and i was running with some friends a couple of weeks ago and i was like i wish i could bring my joy of running to school
7008729 i was thinking about a lot of the students i have and i know a lot of them go home and sit in front of the tv or play video games
7008730 by the second day my kids were requesting to go back outside and do their laps which was great
7008731 by the end of the liberty run we had a good 98 percent of the classrooms participating
7008732 it became a really nice program for the entire school it made the summer fly by but it made it that much more fun for all of us
7008733 you can just walk around and see new stuff im going to start walking more because its better and healthier
7008734 i really didnt anticipate it being such a big school event im really happy with the outcome and how enthusiastic the kids seem to be
7008735 it was just a fabulous success to have staff members model the walking and running with the students
7008736 it created a sense of connection in each classroom that they were all doing that together
7008737 they were aware of the olympics and they wanted to do something similar to the olympics
7008738 of course running and walking is something everybody can do and the marathon is the key of the olympics
7008739 this aktion club is its own club and will have officers and meetings different from ours
7008740 but theyve been gung ho and were really ready for something different
7008741 it the aktion club is a great community connction for us to help others
7008742 the residents are looking forward to being able to help the community
7008743 they want to plan at garage sale at the home
7008744 we want to help them get started then theyll decide what community service project they might want to fund
7008745 and hes been sending me birthday cards every year hes never missed
7008746 and why wouldnt you think someone often receiving all this good will wouldnt want to feel that same sense of satisfaction from helping people
7008747 and were not helping them as advisors were enabling them to help others
7008748 weve learned we just cant serve the community alone we need everyone
7008749 i had no idea that i was even nominated i was shocked
7008750 being able to communicate a series of thoughts and ideas to someone is what i enjoy most about teaching and writing
7008751 we looked at all sorts of things class size building requirements and the need for a special education program that didnt exist at that time

7008758 gt four year old madeline hood left and five year old lilly dangler both of penfield buckle their seat belts as they learn about bus safety on aug 18 both kids will be entering kindergarten next month
7008759 its a kindergarten safety program that i created to ease the fears of the parents and the children for their first school bus experience
7008760 this way the kids themselves can be a little more prepared for the first day
7008761 theres a 10 foot barrier around the bus that we dont want kids to go into
7008762 if they have to use an emergency exit they show them how to do it
7008763 ive had a lot of bus drivers say that theyve had a lot less kids crying than they had before
7008764 would never retain a player against his wishes so we have no alternative to accept the unilateral rescinding of his contract
7008765 he can leave as early as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding a contract which has two years to run
7008766 no because transfers take place when competitions are over not five days before the season starts it is a lack of respect for the club its history and the supporters

7008784 fay will be near or over the gulf coast of the western florida panhandle today and tonight and near or over the gulf coast of mississippi and alabama on sunday
7008785 fay is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches across the western portion of the northern florida peninsula the florida panhandle southwestern georgia and the southern half of both mississippi and alabama with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches possible
7008786 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
7008787 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7008788 students with high levels of involuntary subordination were more likely to experience recurring episodes of major depression even after controlling for lifetime history of major depression and current depressive status
7008789 an evolutionary theory of depression in which people feel there is no escape from negative circumstances or feelings and adapt by withdrawing in order to avoid further emotional harm
7008790 it was crucial to show that involuntary subordination was itself causing depression and not vice versa
7008791 the aim of the concert was to create an image and spread message about the aids awareness among the youth and socially conscious people
7008792 when we organize such music shows we get a lot of response and a lot of people come through the medium of music we can spread the message of aids awareness
7008793 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules

7008861 beh a dire il vero il tuo cuore molto meno bello del mio
7008862 confronta il tuo cuore con il mio il mio perfetto mentre il tuo un rattoppo di ferite e lacrime
7008863 il tuo ha un aspetto assolutamente perfetto ma non farei mai cambio con il mio vedi ciascuna ferita rappresenta una persona alla quale ho donato il mio affetto ho staccato un pezzo del mio cuore e glielho dato e spesso ne ho ricevuto in cambio un pezzo del loro cuore a colmare il vuoto lasciato nel mio cuore ma certo ci che dai non mai esattamente uguale a ci che ricevi cos ho qualche bitorzolo a cui sono affezionato per ciascuno mi ricorda laffetto che ho condiviso altre volte invece ho dato via pezzi del mio cuore a persone che non mi hanno corrisposto questo ti spiega le voragini amare rischioso certo ma per quante dolorose siano queste voragini che rimangono aperte nel mio cuore mi ricordano sempre lamore che provo anke per queste persone e chiss forse un giorno ritorneranno e magari colmeranno lo comprendi adesso che cosa sia la vera bellezza
7008864 if this is a dream then it doesnt matter but if well if this is something else then perhaps this is a test of some sort
7008865 please can you tell me where we are can you help me find my way back to where i came from
7008866 my name is julian and i have no idea how i got here but i want to go back to my friend
7008867 you might be the only person that can help me and we have no way of communicating
7008868 it helps me to focus when i am frustrated at times
7008869 you must think it in order for me to understand my mind does not learn as quickly as my soul
7008870 my name is julian and i am a citizen of the empire from a town called aidelede
7008871 where is it in relation to the renowned monument my people built in the center of the known world
7008872 at the center of the world is the capital city of the empire or so it once was renastus and it has no great monument like you are describing sadly it had been overtaken by darkness several decades ago before i was born i have no idea what condition it is in now
7008873 a structure of that magnitude could not be missed unless
7008874 would you allow me to look deeper into your soul julian
7008875 if i could do so then i could review your memories and determine the fate of my nation since my departure
7008876 i am ixianopatria the high queen of the celeteri the most powerful prosperous and scientifically advanced civilization in existence and i would like very much for you to grant me my request to look deeper into your soul for the answers that i seek plus the information that i obtain may help me to answer the questions that i feel you have for me
7008877 i have already seen within you the questions that you will eventually ask me and their content has made me all the more anxious to first learn the answers to my own
7008878 alright you may do what you need to do madam
7008879 but the experience can be a little disconcerting and you cant fight me or it will not work you have my word that you will not be harmed
7008880 you certainly seem to have some extensive memories of your world
7008881 i apologize it took me some time to search for you
7008882 we are in your memories julian we are in your soul that is why we can speak freely to one another
7008883 it is the cumulative total of what you have experienced and learned of your world i guess one could say it is the sum of your existence stored in your spirit it is everything that you are for as people we are all a sum of our experiences and knowledge everything everyone you knew and loved can be seen experienced and studied we can move forwards and backwards and time as we please as well but are bound by the limitations of your experiences thus we cannot pass into the future that will exist after you came here and we cannot travel further back in the past than you can conceive if we travel back to before the time you were born then what we see will only be the construct of all you have learned secondhand about the past which may or may not be useful to us
7008884 if you do not know about something or have never experienced it then it does not exist here
7008885 what is it that you are looking for within my experiences
7008886 well that is a complicated matter but i promise i will tell you everything so long as you take me to your capital city right down there
7008887 i thought you said that places i had never personally experienced only read about and so forth would be distorted the countryside below is close to where we saw the capital city from higher above the continent but i know ive never been here in my life and yet we are seeing it in such crisp detail could i really have extrapolated this from my other memories and then constructed it with such lucidity
7008888 youve never personally visited the places we now see before us
7008889 yes that is interesting perhaps we should go down and have a closer look
7008890 had your civilization been able to advance unchecked by the darkness you spoke of earlier perhaps some day in the distant future it could have eventually come to rival my own then again it seems you had some way yet to come before reaching perfection
7008891 could i really have constructed all of this from my studies
7008892 hi there little one are you going to be a soldier some day
7008893 you cannot interact with the past julian only observe it lifes choices lifes experiences they cannot be undone or re accomplished think of a river that flows gently down a mountainside each bend hewn into the soil and stone below as the water is channeled around rough spots decisions the water can only flow in one direction in time the world will change and all of the rivers will dry up leaving behind empty valleys marks left upon the earth that will last much longer than the waters that fashioned them what you see before you now is like those valleys it is the past the channels cut into the fabric of eternity by the lives of these people
7008894 but having never been here i mean can this level of detail really be constructed from my imagination my perception of what renastus must have been like based on historical accounts
7008895 there is nothing here no monument no great tower no sign that my people ever existed
7008896 i think i know where all of the stone used to build this city came from
7008897 for my people devoted a lot of time and energy towards bringing it here in such quantities
7008898 we have some experimenting to do we need to find out what has happened since my people vanished julian did and in an instant they were hovering above in the sky high above the continent right where they started after first leaving the throne room
7008899 because you now innately place greater trust me and i in you i possess greater control over what we see and do here i have more power to manipulate our surroundings
7008900 please dont take that statement the wrong way i assure you that i do deserve your trust its just that when we first met some time ago well how could you be blamed for being skeptical of me a strange old woman raving like a lunatic and waving her scepter in front of you
7008901 in time i could teach you how to become the master of your inner world traversing it and causing it to spin forwards and backwards in time as you please but for now i need you to help me understand why your capital city fell and why the real world from whence you came is haunted by this darkness a darkness that personally caused you so much pain
7008902 you didnt speak about them directly im sorry i should have told you sooner i i was listening to your thoughts in order to determine if i could trust you i became able to peer into your subconscious mind some time ago i know that it was unfair julian but you saw the hideous things that the darkness can do i had to make sure you were genuine not corrupted by its terrible power im sorry that you lost your friend in such a horrible way and im sorry that the gods have treated you so unfairly however i want you to know that even after all i have seen and experienced i still find myself admiring your determination to keep living through it all to keep searching for answers even when they seem so elusive
7008903 yes i accept your apology it is true that i am very upset about losing baluf but it seems to me like i am well on my way to making a new friend right now
7008904 i want you to concentrate on going back to the very day you were born what we just saw was probably a jumble of all the time in your spiritual memory thus we have to focus the spectrum of time we are going to examine more precisely if this experience is going to be helpful to us
7008905 now julian i want you to look down at the world and imagine time moving forward it might help you to imagine a sequence of events maybe a building that was built over time that you witnessed growing up maybe a field that was planted try to concentrate on an event that involves the passing of time
7008906 not even half of the area we saw before is now exposed
7008907 but to be sure i would like you to go back in time as far back as you can
7008908 but we already saw from the time of my birth to this point
7008909 just focus on the clouds below and imagine them being put back into place but dont stop when the entire sky is filled keep imagining time moving backwards
7008910 julian i promise that i will explain everything to you but i first want to be certain my theory about what we are experiencing is correct you just have to be patient with me a little longer i know this is hard for you especially since everything is so new it has to be a tremendous burden for you to process all of this information while keeping your wits however i assure you that i am acting in your best interests by waiting until the right moment to tell you what i fear i eventually will you said that we were becoming friends i agree and thus as your friend i must ask you to trust me i need you to continue to go back in time
7008911 this time i was able to watch from the ground as time passed
7008912 although it may sound amazing i was able to watch the events that were taking place down there from the perspective of well i suppose you could say it was you julian but we will discuss that matter in just a second
7008913 and now it is my turn to share all i know though i fear the truth will be even harder for you to accept than even the worst of what you have already experienced
7008914 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we and the fact that emi informed us that not only arent they going to pay us at all but that we are still 1 4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier that the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt just makes you start wondering what is going on shouldnt a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even
7008915 i am very happy to join west bromwich albion because it is a dream for me to play in the premier league

7008917 i will do my best to repay this honour on the pitch and try to get the results to keep west bromwich in this league this is a good chance for me im a young player and i want to improve myself in this team so we can grow up together
7008918 i have been impressed by the manager the players and things around the team its different to spain and a new experience

7008920 mmm i think i failed it but i m not kinda of person in dat area anyway

7008945 conosco il tecnico spalletti da 3 anni nei quali ha dimostrato tutto il suo valore come allenatore qualcosina dir a mourinho ma una cosa che ci sta in queste situazioni fanno parte del calcio speriamo che sia un bello spettacolo a san siro
7008946 sia la roma che linter hanno dei grandi giocatori di qualit e un bel gruppo abbiamo ibra che ha un problema al ginocchio speriamo possa esserci anche la roma ha qualche dubbio di formazione ma dobbiamo essere preoccupati solo dellinter dobbiamo pensare a noi per prima cosa e poi alla roma

7008952 il gol un compito di tutti quelli che sono pi vicini alla porta per la cosa che mi interessa di pi che la squadra vinca chi segna non importante chiaro che se tu fai gol importante ma la cosa fondamentale che linter vinca

7009052 our mission is to improve the health of the community and one of the best ways to do that is to help cultivate these kinds of grass roots initiatives
7009053 at this stage in life as were married and have children i think its very difficult to find a community where you feel welcome and safe this truly becomes a sisterhood where you lean on each other
7009054 i think my stomach muscles last year were more sore than my leg muscles

7009071 parents should get on board and let kids express themselves
7009072 but at the same time you want them to look put together and not be embarrassed im happy to see this looser sensibility right now
7009073 letting them express themselves is the prevailing parenting wisdom right now and its nice to see it echoed in fashion
7009074 prints are bright and cheerful and i say the more the merrier
7009075 its like there are no rules and thats what kids love and parents would do it too if they could

7009096 we didnt think we played well we had a lot of senior players down but in the last quarter our boys found a way to win which was the most important thing
7009097 i know they got close to us at the end but we came from seven points down at three quarter time and got ourselves three goals ahead that was a pretty fair turnaround
7009098 you dont necessarily need senior players that have been in the game for so long making off the ball decisions like they do
7009099 it just makes it so hard for the younger group to gain any sort of resolve when things like that happen

7009139 the mhra is aware of the issue any regulatory action that may be necessary to minimise harm to patients will be taken once the new information has been carefully reviewed
7009140 based on the information presented by the study investigator and the analyses conducted independently by the university of oxford clinical trial service unit and epidemiological studies unit msp believes the cancer finding is likely to be an anomaly that taken in the light of all the available data does not support an association with vytorin also known as inegy
7009141 we are committed to working with regulatory agencies to further evaluate the available data and interpretations of those data we do not believe that changes in the clinical use of vytorin are warranted
7009142 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7009143 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role

7009152 we are planning to revamp the entire programming of the channel
7009153 saas v s bahu is a stepping stone for our new offerings
7009154 the key to any reality show is the concept that gives the audience a reason to watch while conceiving the reality show we were pretty sure that it was not going to be just another of those song and dance shows where tv stars get together and shake a leg the premise of the saas bahu conflict has become so deeprooted in our audiences psyche that it has become a genre of its own
7009155 a reality show does not become a habit during weekends even if it reaches to a larger audience with the help of saas v s bahu we want to create a habit among our audiences and going further on the back of it we will launch some fiction shows at primetime
7009156 on behalf of icl i welcome on board vishnu manchu as an investor and enthusiastic cricketer vishnus impressive credentials as an entrepreneur and his popularity in hyderabad adds solidity to icls objective of promoting domestic indian cricket
7009157 with eminent personalities like mithun chakrabarty stakeholder of royal bengal tigers and now vishnu manchu aligning with icl its my full confidence and unshakeable belief that icl will play an important role in strengthening domestic indian cricket
7009158 i promise to make all efforts to take my team and company icl heroes sports to a higher level of quality cricket and cricketers what i like about icl is the focused approach of providing quality cricket for millions of cricket lovers

7009161 some of the stuff from china was really worth appreciating indian content is very much at par with them however compared to others indian broadcasters and production houses lag behind in sending entries this is necessarily due to lack of awareness among them
7009162 we always do our bit to make them aware we spread awareness through our website via email and through events like mipcom and miptv to encourage entries from across the globe any channel or a production house is free to send entries
7009163 iphone will be available in six major cities including delhi mumbai kolkata chennai and bangalore and later it will be available in 65 cities across the country the product will be sold through our own retails outlets arcs limited modern retailers and authorised apple centres in the country
7009164 we are also in talks with different banks for providing finance for our customers
7009165 the price is higher due to non cancellable contract we as a service provider will not be making extra revenue through the sale of the handsets its a complete pass through our duty is to sell the product to the customers and provide services
7009166 presently there are 30 000 iphone users on airtels network however these handsets might belong to the grey market a significant number of customers have already paid an advance of rs 5000 to book the phone
7009167 unlike the indian cinema industry that can make 10 films in one year and market them well too the animation industrys expertise lies only in production the people here take at least two to three years to release a single film and do not know how to promote and market it thus this conference aims to provide a platform to both these industries wherein they can share not only their domain expertise with each other but also help the indian animation industry grow further
7009168 getting film folk and trade to attend the conference has been an experience and our fingers are crossed frankly speaking this is a modest beginning an assured positive outcome is that there will be a movement towards bringing animation into the mainstream and all the discussions as well as the networking is really going to be useful for our animation industry colleagues
7009169 the advertising revenue of the market has been growing with a cagr of 18 per cent since there is no doubt that advertising is the fuel that drives the satellite boom and indias burgeoning news channels trade
7009170 times now did not devout a single second to khali yet we did not lose out on viewers and market share
7009171 it is high time someone realise that a news channel is meant for only news
7009172 depending upon the band preferences of the channel the distribution cost of a national channel can range anything between rs 200 800 million
7009173 the content is thus decided by the geographical placement of the peoplemeter to get spikes in the ratings hence some parts of india where the peoplemeter is absent and some stories are left untouched or given very little importance
7009174 distribution costs have gone up tremendously because of the clutter of channels this is in fact affects quality as a lot of money from a fixed budget goes into distribution and channels compromise on quality if only we could be patient a lot of difference could come in
7009175 the single biggest problem in the industry today is distribution
7009176 in this battle multi system operator mso and local cable operator lco point fingers at each other but either way it is costing the broadcaster and money that could and should have been spent on content is getting spent on distribution instead and it weakens the industry

7009198 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a wall street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months
7009199 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed
7009200 the overall debt burden in the us economy is currently at record levels raising concerns that a recession if it occurs could set off a sharp downward spiral
7009201 the biggest one month fall since modern records began in 1959 the process is accelerating and will require the fed to slash rates at its september meeting
7009202 over time inflation will be the last problem that the fed will have to face as a severe us recession and global slowdown will lead to a sharp reduction in inflationary pressures in the u s slack in goods markets with demand falling below supply will reduce pricing power of firms slack in labor markets with unemployment rising will reduce wage pressures and labor costs pressures a fall in commodity prices of the order of 30 will further reduce inflationary pressure the fed will have to cut the fed funds rate much more as severe downside risks to growth and to financial stability will dominate any short term upward inflationary pressures leaving aside the risk of a collapse of the us dollar given this easier monetary policy the fed funds rate may end up being closer to 0 than 1 by the end of this financial crisis and severe recession cycle
7009203 recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending here are the facts tax rebates of 78 billion arrived in the second quarter of the year the governments recent gdp figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra 12 billion or 15 of the lost revenue the rest went into savings including the paydown of debt consumer outlays increased to 36 billion from 24 billion so the additional 12 billion of consumer spending was less than 16 of the extra 76 billion of disposable personal income by comparison savings rose by 62 billion or five times as much this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity
7009204 the recent plunge in m3 ed m3 is the broadest measure of money used by economists to estimate the entire supply of money makes it likely that credit lines have been fully tapped and or banks have simply turned off the spigot liquidity shrinks by the day banks scrambling to refinance long term debt are going to have a very tough go of it weekly unemployment claims are soaring consumers out of a job are going to have a tough time paying bills those looking for a bottom in these conditions are simply barking up the wrong tree
7009205 the problem began in the roaring twenties when the fed made money plentiful by keeping interest rates low money seemed to be plentiful but what was actually flowing freely was credit or debt production was up more than wages so more goods were available than money to pay for them but people could borrow money was so easy to get that people were borrowing just to invest taking out short term low interest loans that were readily available from the banks
7009206 the fed began selling securities in the open market reducing the money supply by reducing the reserves available for backing loans the result was a huge liquidity squeeze a lack of available money short term loans suddenly became available only at much higher interest rates making buying stock on margin much less attractive as fewer people bought stock prices fell removing the incentive for new buyers to purchase stocks bought by earlier buyers on margin the stock market crashed overnight
7009207 the federal reserve definitely caused the great depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933

7009251 share the humiliating experience i suffered in the hands of officials of air france airline
7009252 its about air france airline i bought a ticket from them on the 13th of june 2008 to travel to washington dc as i was buying the ticket they told me that there was no need for me to bother about a transit visa through paris within that period and when i got to the airport on the 13th of june i was checked in to fly to america ordinarily without a transit visa they wouldnt check me in but because theyd assured me of a transit visa i was checked in so when we had a stopover at paris nobody asked me of any transit visa
7009253 we got to america and i went out to do my business after which i headed back to the airport on the 10th of july 2008 to take my flight back to nigeria as i was supposed to have the opening concert tour for my new album to my greatest surprise when i got to the airport they refused to board me
7009254 bewildered i started asking the officials what was wrong and they said that i needed a transit visa i tried to explain to them that back home in nigeria when i bought the ticket the airline gave me a waiver on the transit visa as im a regular flier with them but they insisted on not boarding me and immediately cancelled my flight and referred me to the french embassy
7009255 they told me to book an on line appointment and i followed their instruction only to realise that the nearest date of appointment was on the 21st of july 2008 2 weeks after i should have gone back to nigeria i became frustrated and somebody advised me to go to the french high commission and talk to them personally to see if they can give me concession knowing that im going for my show which ive invested a lot of money in on getting there i became more frustrated because they didnt even allow me into the compound despite my threat to lie across the road and be killed if they dont attend to me they only said i should wait till 3 pm to see if anybody will attend to me i waited and waited but nothing was forthcoming
7009256 i had to go to the nigerian embassy and on getting there i was faced with more surprises as i realised that the nigerian embassy is not a place where a nigerian can run for shelter for they will rather kill you than save you when someone is chasing you they sent their security to send me out even when i tried to explain my situation
7009257 i had checked out of my hotel and had used the little money i have left to give out to people whom i felt needed the money so i was left with just twenty dollars i had no other choice than to be sleeping in the cold at the washington airport like a destitute until the third day when i ran into an american soldier who identified me as a musician he met at sunny okosuns wake keep in maryland america and he was shocked to see me in that condition hungry and battered by cold i explained everything to him and he took it upon himself to get a visa and another ticket for me with ethiopian airline and that was how this good samaritan assisted me to come back to nigeria a journey that was supposed to take just three days i ended up spending five nights as a destitute
7009258 now that im back i need to claim that return ticket from air france and also ive lost a lot of money in the concert that i missed
7009259 successive military regimes subdued the rule of law facilitated the wanton looting of the public treasury decapitated public institutions and free speech and instituted a secret and opaque culture in the running of government business the result of these was total insecurity poor economic management abuse of human rights economic conflicts and capital flight
7009260 it cant be true why would america blacklist the efcc for what the efcc has got more support from the european union and other european nations more than any other region of the world
7009261 nigeria is an independent nation just like america so it will be inappropriate for the u s to meddle in the affairs of a nigerian government agency just as it would be inappropriate for nigeria to meddle in the affairs of an american government agency
7009262 but be that as it may i must say that i doubt any story that america has blacklisted the efcc dont forget that the american ambassador was the first ambassador to visit the current administration in fact she has visited the new administration twice and on each occasion she made public statement indicating her countrys support for the organization
7009263 i am not aware honestly i am not aware at the senate we allocated enough money for them
7009264 but if it has come to the point where nigeria is threatened all the time we should look elsewhere for support
7009265 what im really worried about at the moment are the innuendos and insinuations on the cbn governor on his performance what soludo needs from nigerian government and nigerian people is their support to enable him reform the economy all these innuendos and insinuations about his performance should be kept aside
7009266 they may be right if they say nigeria is softening its anti corruption crusade but we are a sovereign country and no reason for them to threaten us with withholding funds
7009267 i am not justifying what is going on now because it is obvious all the people who were arrested by the efcc charged to court and later granted bail are now part of the people running yar aduas government
7009268 not only that the investigation of the energy sector has clearly shown that some governors would be implicated and would have been arrested but the federal government prevailed and even appointed them members of the power committee set up by the federal government and is fighting to have them re elected in re run elections
7009269 corruption has been institutionalized and these people have interest in nigeria because of their investments they are pressurizing the efcc but whether nigeria is still fighting corruption or not would be determined by how yaradua handles the power probe report
7009270 it is true are we really fighting corruption i just returned from kinshasha congo there was no power outage for one second we were in addis ababa for two days there was no power outage
7009271 in the past ten years has this country published the number of graduates it has produced and how many of them that are employed
7009272 efcc does not need foreign donors to support it financially if for instance we misappropriated 16 billion on energy sector and efcc recovers at least half of it that would be more than enough for the commission we dont need foreign donors if we are serious
7009273 those countries fighting corruption in their countries do they get financial support from others of course we are not serious our leaders misappropriate billions and go scot free can you imagine 16 billion wasted on energy and the loot not recovered but the foreigners know sss knows because some of them work in banks and knew how money is being siphoned and the secret accounts
7009274 we should blame ourselves if efcc does not have funds to work with and foreign donors are withdrawing their support it is unfortunate the action of the attorney general is not helping matters the impression one gets is that government was not out to combat corruption
7009275 we need the cooperation of international donors because the stolen money are kept in their countries and they know better than us we need them to tell us who stole what when it comes to stolen funds they know us better than we do
7009276 after god the us and the uk know us better if they decide to withdraw their support it is right even the removal and demotion of nuhu ribadu are pointers to that it is obvious that the so called rule of law pledged by president yaradua is becoming a mirage
7009277 so many things are going on now around yaradua there was this report on yaraduas wife and the attempt to gag the press from making the report public it is funny
7009278 the removal and demotion of nuhu ribadu is putting us in a bad light everybody knows there is much more to it because it was government that promoted ribadu it was also government that demoted him all those talks about due process is mere jiving
7009279 okay look at the national assembly and their earnings and what they spent on cars its terrible so i support the uk us they should donate their money to the masses and we will share the money to rehabilitate unemployed graduates who are everywhere

7009407 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules

7009413 there was no better way for china to convey their history and culture this is why i became a teacher
7009414 you can never underestimate just how significant music and arts can be in helping children learn and solve complex problems

7009416 its wonderful to see someone who loves teaching music became a department chair where she can make a difference
7009417 i hope to continue the growth in both numbers of students who benefit from the arts and program quality in course offerings experiences and accessibility
7009418 more and more students are becoming involved in festivals and art competitions enhancing their learning process and often providing a sense of belonging and a feeling of connection to their school and community thats why i love arts and i want all my students to share this passion
7009419 i had no idea that i was even nominated i was shocked
7009420 being able to communicate a series of thoughts and ideas to someone is what i enjoy most about teaching and writing
7009421 we looked at all sorts of things class size building requirements and the need for a special education program that didnt exist at that time
7009422 it was a struggle and took some time but district enrollment began to increase it was encouraging
7009423 his generous nature and positive contributions on behalf of all rush henrietta children and community is greatly appreciated and truly warrants this honorable award
7009424 my children being born those were the two happiest days of my life

7009433 amar singh from samajwadi party social activists medha patkar and kuldip nayar are also joining us
7009434 we want a peaceful agitation but if something goes out of gear its the state governments responsibility

7009450 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7009451 watch the first obama biden rally live at 3 p m et on www barackobama com spread the word
7009452 barack obama and joe biden are the leaders who will bring the change our country needs but they cant do it alone show your support for the obama biden ticket by making a donation today
7009453 people say they like me people tell me they think id be a good president but that they just dont think i can win
7009454 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7009455 what they managed to do was turn a presentation that probably wouldnt have been noticed outside of a small community of people into something that everybody knows about

7009460 de verbetering van het ondernemersvertrouwen heeft alles te maken met de goedkopere olie en euro
7009461 een verzwakking van de euro is belangrijk voor de belgische economie die sterk afhangt van de uitvoer
7009462 de goedkopere euro en olie zorgen voor opluchting maar dat fenomeen is van voorbijgaande aard de komende maanden zal het vertrouwen verder zakken want er is slecht nieuws op komst
7009463 zelfs al stabiliseert de olie op een niveau van 110 dollar per vat en verliest de euro verder terrein dan nog zal het negatieve nieuws de bovenhand krijgen
7009464 de voorbije jaren was er al een sterke verkoop dat in combinatie met de stijgende brandstofprijzen en de dalende koopkracht had ons doen verwachten dat het aantal personenwagens zou dalen

7009468 nobody thinks that these boats will break the siege in a practical way but this is a moral message what is happening in gaza is illegal and inhumane and must be halted

7009475 sono un conservatore nel senso inteso da hannah arendt che si preoccupava della preservazione del mondo oggi comunque non c pi ordine costituito ma solo un cambiamento costituito la nostra sola tradizione il progresso viviamo in nome del movimento e del cambiamento continuo in questo contesto io mi considero un rivoluzionario perch ormai la sola rivoluzione possibile quella che interrompe le derive contemporanee
7009476 gli elettori delegano il peccato ai potenti cos possono immaginare di non essere colpevoli giudizi di valore da qualche parte per prendere decisioni in base al suo principio e la teoria morale che ha non quindi lutilitarismo ma lo specifico criterio decisionale adottato
7009477 sapientia deriva da assaporare serve altro commento che non sia mettere in moto il pensiero il ragionamento critico come sapore delle cose
7009478 allora 1929 credevo ancora che esistesse una teoria economica solida e obiettiva priva di giudizi di valore questa credenza non secondo la mia opinione attuale che un ingenuo empirismo i fatti non si organizzano da soli in concetti e in teorie solo perch vengono osservati sono perci arrivato alla conclusione che sia sempre necessario dallinizio alla fine lavorare con premesse di valore esplicite

7009525 were just going to go out there and get the 3 points its going to be a tough game we all know that but we have a very strong team
7009526 its very early days yet andy mangan getting two goals helps his confidence and there are little plusses in every game weve got to keep adding to them
7009527 woking have had three defeats but their team is no worse than anybody elses
7009528 we seem to be playing the teams who are on a high from last season and it does carry momentum this season
7009529 danny gives us positional and organisational powers on the pitch
7009530 you shouldnt read too much into the team we pick for saturday or monday its a quick turnaround and well probably need literally every body we have
7009531 no player is 100 match fit because theyve not played regularly for three or four months thats why we werent as efficient at forest green as we were at lewes
7009532 the dead include 24 children most of them belonging to the families of saharias tribals though the first death was reported july 25 the health department officials have still not woken up
7009533 firstly the doctors are rarely available in the only district hospital in shivpuri even when they are present they simply refer the patient to gwalior 125 km from shivpuri district headquarters
7009534 since most of the localities from where the outbreak of malaria have been reported are inhabited by poor tribals they cant take the patient to gwalior
7009535 so far only 30 deaths have occurred due to various diseases

7009538 future funding levels after 2010 for swimming queensland under the development program have not yet been determined
7009539 we need to be getting more money for grass roots not less
7009540 all swimmers have to come through these junior development programs
7009541 well lose swimmers that would go into the program to other sports
7009542 its just disappointing there will be a direct impact for sure coming into the next olympics it will happen that quickly
7009543 you think you would get funding dropped back if you werent performing but we are performing and bringing results
7009544 these enormous funding cuts will surely spell the end of queenslands reign in the pool
7009545 this year swimming queensland received 250 000 through the program and 75 000 for special initiatives
7009546 we have recently agreed to provide an elite coach from the queensland academy of sport specifically for swimming queensland to develop elite swimmers within their clubs which is worth around 100 000 per year

7009550 i have no problem with the corporate communications department undergoing a review but i do wonder at the absolute need to employ external consultants based over 400 miles away to undertake such a task
7009551 the experienced external consultants were appointed on grounds of cost and the capacity to undertake the review quickly
7009552 if the end result is as we hope a more efficient and effective service then i am sure all colleagues on the council will agree that it was worth spending the money
7009553 if the conclusion is that we have an ideal set up right now then i think the exercise will still have been worthwhile
7009554 i am against the proposed closure of the nicolson street post office i have seen for myself how busy the nicolson street post office is and know that it is relied upon by many older people and people with disabilities who use the post office while at the pharmacy
7009555 over 600 people have already signed petitions objecting to the closure and feelings are running high in the area
7009556 i also know that people in gorgie and shandon will be concerned to hear about the possible loss of these local post offices and would urge local people to make their views known during the consultation period
7009557 i am concerned that at a time when edinburghs world heritage site status is potentially under threat that we are not being more vigilant in policing breaches in the rules
7009558 this massive banner is completely out of keeping with the surrounding area and should be removed immediately no commercial entity should be above planning and advertising regulations
7009559 the sdi software has made the su30 mki platform more versatile and compatible with other air forces

7009564 das was fr her die very high einstellung war hei t jetzt enthusiast und diese option ist jetzt auch unter dx9 zug nglich
7009565 wir haben die exklusivit t herausgenommen und uns gedacht wenn leute das auf ihrem rechner laufen lassen wollen warum sollen wir das einschr nken
7009566 wenn der rechner das darstellen kann weil die erforderliche performance reserve da ist dann ist das richtig
7009567 das war unser ziel wir wollen die furcht vom spieler wegnehmen dass er unser produkt nicht spielen kann warhead ist ein spiel das jeder spielen kann es wird mit einem pc der 400 euro kostet spielbar sein und zwar auf high settings das spiel wird mit einer sehr guten framerate also ich denke mit 30 bis 35 fps durchschnittlich laufen das war ja auch mit crysis schon teilweise m glich aber wenn man einen 2 000 euro pc hat der nicht gut konfiguriert ist dann hat der gegen einen 600 700 euro pc verloren der besser konfiguriert ist das hei t manche leute hatten 2 000 3 000 euro nicht in die richtige konfiguration investiert zu einem gewissen grad lassen sich diese optimierungen sogar f r crysis nachpatchen aber das wird viel zeit in anspruch nehmen weil die optimierungen ziemlich tiefgreifend sind wir sind noch dabei die schritte einzuleiten aber erst mal wollen wir warhead abschlie en
7009568 meine montessori ausbildung zeigte mir auf wieviel spa es machen kann neues zu entdecken
7009569 ich glaube der beste teil ist es einfach wie unglaublich kreativ man sich f hlt wenn man die verschiedenen bereiche der welt gestaltet
7009570 die kreation einer intelligenten rasse die sich im weltall auf der suche nach dem sinn des lebens machen kann
7009571 ich wollte schon immer ein spiel entwickeln dass sich an zehn hoch anm d red buch und kurzfilm ber die reise von elementarteilchen quarks zu leuchtstarken galaxien quasaren orientiert ich hege au erdem ein gro es interesse f r astrobiologie wissenschaft ber die m glichkeiten extraterrestrischer lebensformen weil die so wahnsinnig viele bereiche der wissenschaft geschichte und zukunft ber hrt
7009572 ich m chte mit spore viele verschiedene spieler erreichen ich w nsche mir dass sich der durchschnittliche sims spieler mit spore besch ftigt um sich kreativ auszutoben und geschichten zu erleben und der hardcore spieler wegen der strategischen tiefe
7009573 mit dem kreatureneditor kannst du ja problemlos kleine fellige tiere oder ork artige zweibeiner erstellen ich glaube aber eigentlich dass spore dadurch interessanter wird dass es aussieht wie kaum ein anderes spiel
7009574 wenn du das m chtest klar du kannst eine ungef hre imitation der menschlichen entwicklung nachspielen
7009575 wir konzentrieren uns sehr auf die emotionalen zust nde der spielfiguren au erdem f hlen sich spieler wie die sims reihe gezeigt hat sehr verbunden mit figuren die sie selbst erschaffen haben
7009576 begriffe wie gut oder b se benutzen wir nicht aber nat rlich kannst du sowohl sehr aggressiv als auch friedfertig vorgehen der gr te thematische unterschied ist nat rlich dass du in spore den ganzen weg mitmachst deine kreaturen starten als mickrige teichwesen und k nnen sich letztendlich sogar zu g tter hnlichen wesen entwickeln und eigene welten kreieren
7009577 mit den ersten konzepten habe ich im jahr 2000 angefangen

7009590 this year swimming queensland received 250 000 through the program and 75 000 for special initiatives
7009591 we want to expand the scope of the program to represent multiple musical genres
7009592 so this summer we invited stephen pate to co ordinate the singer songwriter series
7009593 its a great opportunity for the singer songwriter because you get to play a lot more of your material than you would at an open mike
7009594 i watch peoples feet and if their feet are moving tapping to the music then ill assume its a successful arrangement if theyre not then ill rework it over the next week

7009600 he was electrifying in his white jumpsuit with his cape on
7009601 he was quite humble but he had an aura there are very few people who have triple x charisma and elvis was one

7009621 another part was inspired by maggie carmichael who was in the first edition of speed the plow
7009622 i lived in a small farm community and i did all the work baled hay picked potatoes and all the work you do in a farm community i have a great affinity for island farms and the farm way of life the song came from that life
7009623 its just a fun song to get you to come home to pei and hang out with your friends and family
7009624 it was exactly like the last verse that i thought i had made up about acadians who didnt make shore
7009625 we lost power in concerts while playing that song so many times we put the song at the end so it wouldnt end the concert early we lost lights we shut down the vancouver folk festival in the middle of the festival over that song we were playing a tv show with rita macneil and a wind storm came up weve had three lightening storms in the middle of that song

7009628 im a runner myself and i was running with some friends a couple of weeks ago and i was like i wish i could bring my joy of running to school
7009629 i was thinking about a lot of the students i have and i know a lot of them go home and sit in front of the tv or play video games
7009630 by the second day my kids were requesting to go back outside and do their laps which was great
7009631 by the end of the liberty run we had a good 98 percent of the classrooms participating
7009632 it became a really nice program for the entire school it made the summer fly by but it made it that much more fun for all of us
7009633 you can just walk around and see new stuff im going to start walking more because its better and healthier
7009634 i really didnt anticipate it being such a big school event im really happy with the outcome and how enthusiastic the kids seem to be
7009635 it was just a fabulous success to have staff members model the walking and running with the students
7009636 it created a sense of connection in each classroom that they were all doing that together
7009637 they were aware of the olympics and they wanted to do something similar to the olympics
7009638 of course running and walking is something everybody can do and the marathon is the key of the olympics
7009639 you have a huge responsibility to a lot of people and everybody gets over emotional its draining it takes so much out of you
7009640 i hope he does it at 3 in the morning

7009647 creo que el se or branco marinkovic ha cometido un error al hablar de federalismo cuando el sentimiento regional en santa cruz y en otros departamentos habla de autonom as
7009648 no corresponde al tribunal permanente de justicia militar juzgar a este sargento porque cometi un delito tipificado en el c digo penal como asesinato con ensa amiento y alevos a en contra de la v ctima
7009649 la pregunta es ahora en qu quedan los referendos para la aprobaci n sobre los estatutos auton micos donde los electores de pando beni santa cruz y tarija fueron a votar en el marco del estado unitario y de pronto les dicen que esos estatutos no son suficientes y hay que ir al federalismo
7009650 el federalismo es un sistema en el que existen varios estados bajo un manto com n de un estado federal lo que significa un deterioro de la unidad nacional
7009651 el delito consumado fue dentro de una instituci n castrense entre personal militar y es obligaci n de las fuerzas armadas a trav s de los mecanismos legales iniciar la investigaci n en la fase sumarial y posterior derivar el caso como corresponde a la justicia militar para el debido proceso

7009677 gt four year old madeline hood left and five year old lilly dangler both of penfield buckle their seat belts as they learn about bus safety on aug 18 both kids will be entering kindergarten next month
7009678 its a kindergarten safety program that i created to ease the fears of the parents and the children for their first school bus experience
7009679 this way the kids themselves can be a little more prepared for the first day
7009680 theres a 10 foot barrier around the bus that we dont want kids to go into
7009681 if they have to use an emergency exit they show them how to do it
7009682 ive had a lot of bus drivers say that theyve had a lot less kids crying than they had before

7009684 si tuviera que elegir un escritor cuya obra marcar el futuro se ser a kim stanley robinson
7009685 no no i go to the movies but i dont buy movie companies i mean im always interested in understanding the math of things and understanding as much as i can about all aspects of business
7009686 and what i learn today may be useful to me two years from now i mean if i understand the tarsands today and oil prices change or whatever may happen ive got that filed away and i can use it at some later date
7009687 they taped it up and put some stuff on it i was a little upset but i sucked it up in this game you have to hide everything you cant just stop because you break something
7009688 i was up against several very good opponents and every match was very very hard so i think it all makes my gold medal even more valuable
7009689 i would have lots of questions for him i was fascinated by the athletes energy my father would tell me they were special people who had worked hard to get there
7009690 im going to take a break and reflect on what im doing for the next four years
7009691 i want that gold medal but it will take four more years of my life and obviously to want it and do it are two different things
7009692 we kicked at the same time but her kick went in
7009693 it was really close i was right there but at the end i think i lacked a bit of energy and strength guess i didnt have the juice
7009694 it was close but sometimes just a little thing made the difference
7009695 she was strong mentally she did the right moves sometimes these things happen
7009696 im still in shock because i dont really appreciate the silver medal i have now around my neck
7009697 im not down or depressed or anything im just completely disappointed
7009698 the plan is to keep the economy strong and put money back into peoples pockets not to destroy our agri food and manufacturing industry through extra taxes
7009699 by then ill be a 55 year old tradesman looking for a job i probably wont get one in canada
7009700 between windsor and the quebec border theres probably about 1 500 tool and die makers out of work because that sector has gone to china and korea all the tools are being manufactured in china and korea
7009701 it is to cut taxes on what we want more of income and shift it taxes towards pollution it has worked in many countries and it should work in canada
7009702 message of hope will win against the message of fear
7009703 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7009704 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7009705 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7009706 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7009707 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7009708 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7009709 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7009715 es muy dif cil pero siempre hay alg n porcentaje no s si del uno por ciento o cual pero hay posibilidades que tenemos que aprovechar lo que hizo argentina sirve para nosotros por la fuerza que dieron los jugadores no habituales aunque uno de los de siempre luis scola veintiocho puntos frente a los norteamericanos en semifinales estuvo fant stico
7009716 vamos a ver si damos la talla es dif cil despu s de la derrota que tuvimos con ellos pero en esa derrota estuvimos muy por debajo de nuestras posibilidades y estados unidos al cien por cien
7009717 estados unidos estaba pensando m s en la final que en argentina es lo que pas en la primera fase contra ellos que el equipo pensaba m s en los cuartos de final pero ste es el ltimo partido
7009718 ellos juegan a un ritmo muy alto y tiene una potencia tremenda eso hace dif cil jugar contra ellos porque dificulta el ataque frenarles la velocidad y el rebote de ataque es dif cil espero que los rbitros piten los pasos con los que cobran ventaja y las faltas pero si no lo hacen no es bice para que nosotros nos paremos
7009719 es muy importante saber que ellos defienden siempre y nosotros no podemos estar descansando en ataque cuando no tenemos el bal n hay que jugar sin bal n para que el jugador que lo tiene siempre tenga el recurso de poder pasar es un trabajo que hay que hacer siempre
7009720 depende como hagas la zona por ejemplo el argentino juan pedro guti rrez es un jugador complementario en granada pero pon a el cuerpo en la semifinal ante los estadounidenses y no pod an hacer mates
7009721 oberto que es un jugador m s contrastado pon a la mano y quitaba el cuerpo as que entraban a matar hay que poner el cuerpo pero no es f cil es muy importante ponerse
7009722 el momento de hacer el resumen de los juegos ser despu s del partido pero no cabe duda de que el baloncesto espa ol ha vuelto a triunfar en un campeonato internacional al ser algo tan repetido durante tantos a os quiere decir que hay un trabajo fenomenal tanto en la formaci n como en los clubes en la acb y en la federaci n y eso es un motivo de orgullo
7009723 seguro que no vamos a repetir el partido de estados unidos
7009724 dos medallas de plata no se consiguen todos los d as
7009725 claro que me satisface dos medallas de plata no se ganan todos los d as
7009726 hoy consegu la plata otra vez igual que ayer pero hoy un poco m s contento la medalla de ayer pienso que ten a un poco m s de opciones que en la de 500 la de 500 estaba un poco m s abierta y el ruso estuvo muy fuerte y al final consigui la victoria

7009733 republic of ireland assistant team manager liam brady has been discharged from beaumont hospital this afternoon flowing completion of his medical examinations
7009734 he has been given a clean bill of health and has told us he will return to work today when he will travel to london to be at the tottenham v sunderland match with marco tardelli
7009735 he was in great form and took a full part in the match
7009736 i saw him in the second half pacing up and down in the dressing room he was normal
7009737 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
7009738 as for offshore drilling its safe enough these days that not even hurricanes katrina and rita could cause significant spillage from the battered rigs off the coasts of new orleans and houston
7009739 yeast express a protein called hsp104 which is able to reverse protein aggregation
7009740 however for reasons that are unclear hsp104 is not found in mammals we wondered if introducing hsp104 into mammals could help with diseases connected with protein aggregation
7009741 one thing wed like to do next is to treat an animal model which already has considerable quantities of alpha synuclein aggregates to see if hsp104 can actually reverse the process in the rat brain
7009742 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
7009743 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
7009744 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
7009745 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
7009746 a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning
7009747 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
7009748 its almost the perfect storm when people get sick they cannot get a timely appointment with their primary care provider and they have to wait for hours to be seen in a crowded emergency department
7009749 meanwhile the government and insurance carriers continue to cut payments and avoid reimbursing for services its hard to imagine either candidate can keep the ship afloat without a major change in direction
7009750 we are witnessing unprecedented growth in smaller towns and cities and plan to increase our geographic presence in such places with launch of the radio phone r300 the growing popularity of the radio in the tier two and tier three cities has created a tremendous opportunity for penetrating such markets and we are confident that our new offering will be well received by our consumers

7009758 i drive i take care of myself and i do whatever i want but i was looking to see if there was anyone else in my situation going through the same struggles i am i think a lot of young people are troubled with that youve got a family thats incredibly supportive but no one understands what youre going through except another person who has gone through what youre going through
7009759 david had been looking for social support and came to our general support group and said this is fine but im 28 years old and im really looking to talk to somebody my age about these things i heard his heart and knew there was a need out there
7009760 im now in the process of trying to send out questionnaires to young stroke survivors to identify specifically their unique needs
7009761 although stroke is the third leading cause of death and the number one cause of adult disability people tend to be uninformed about strokes and life after stroke the support groups offer an opportunity for people to share their experiences and learn from one another about coping with the changes taking place in their lives
7009762 our stroke support group community is like a big family where people network and support each other and the young persons support group has been phenomenal
7009763 this unparalleled support and endorsement is the engine that will drive real change for people impacted by mental illness and addiction
7009764 the new environment that we can now build as part of our bold redevelopment will greatly increase the opportunities for researchers clients and partners to work together to generate timely relevant research that can seamlessly translate into clinical practice that provides optimal care
7009765 due to stigma psychiatry and addiction treatment are behind many other areas of medicine this support provides many of the tools we need to dramatically improve client community and workplace health reduce the burden of these diseases and their impact on the health care system
7009766 camhs proposal brings together a group of outstanding researchers to advance a world class innovative research agenda
7009767 the proposed research will be an important factor in enhancing knowledge and public awareness of mental health and addictions
7009768 for public health reasons we remain concerned about the abuse of prescription drugs and any associated addiction overdose or deaths
7009769 our goals are to encourage physicians to treat legitimate chronic pain and to discourage recreational drug abuse i believe this updated analysis provides further evidence of the potential for remoxy to achieve these goals
7009770 the results of these studies further substantiate remoxys potential as a useful solution that may offer a new standard in chronic pain management
7009771 king is committed to developing uniquely designed medicines such as remoxy that not only meet the needs of chronic pain patients but also help address the problem of prescription drug abuse and misuse including use with alcohol which is currently threatening our communities
7009772 this is incredibly exciting science frontier science and its great to see australian researchers leading the way
7009773 together well be able to access biological models that have been developed for specific research projects combining our technical resources means we can spend more time actually doing the research that will make a real difference in our efforts to combat diseases
7009774 australia has a wealth of talent in medical research spread across a number of institutions each organisation has its own strengths in different areas
7009775 the apn will allow our resources to be combined and greatly enhance australias research capacity
7009776 so much had gone on in our personal lives before we got together to make this album
7009777 that when we got in the studio we were really enthused just happy to be in each others company and to be playing music again it felt like and when we finally sat down together and picked up our instruments the music really flowed out of us in a very natural way in that four years we just grew up i guess into adults and that was reflected in the music i think creatively and musically the band is better than weve ever been
7009778 donna and i used to provide most of the rhythm guitar in the band
7009779 and were not particularly accomplished guitarists were pretty much three chord strummers
7009780 donna and i started putting our guitars down and thats allowed the rhythm section and josh to really open up they are no longer limited by our playing and what we can do i think im a better singer because of that too
7009781 he only just picked up the guitar when he joined the band on tour wed go out and watch movies and hed spend hours and hours and hours in the hotel room just practicing and writing songs he was very quiet about it and then one day he comes out with a cd
7009782 donna and i stopped singing harmony for a while when our personal relationship got really tense there for a few years
7009783 and we started singing less together onstage and started singing solo songs but thats not the case anymore and we really enjoy singing together again
7009784 we were given an opportunity to play at that folk convention
7009785 then there was a buzz about the band at the convention and that was really exciting for us because we were in america of all places we left that convention with all these promises floating around in our heads and they all came true
7009786 a few months later we came back to america and were playing all these festivals wed never heard of let alone ever attended and the organizers were giving us prime spots on the main stage it went on for about a year and a half festival after festival all over the place
7009787 at the time that we were on tour with dylan i wasnt fully aware of the weight of the situation
7009788 its only been in retrospect i was at a place in my life where id just met my husband and my head was elsewhere id run off stage and go call him and talk for hours rather than hang backstage with bob dylan years later when i was sitting in my home in the suburbs after having my second child the scorsese film about dylan came on tv and i was watching it and i just was like man i got up and sang with this guy and hes a part of modern history it was an amazing opportunity
7009789 success is bittersweet you get a young upcoming band theyre the new thing and everybodys feeding off that energy its exciting to be a part of that while all this wonderful stuff was happening in our careers as it always happens with every band you spend too much time on the road your relationships start to break down communication starts to break down and really we started to implode all that ego got out of hand a little bit i dont think we were consistently solid as musicians or performers i think our gigs were so so donna and i were at the whims of our emotions i think you could tell we didnt want to be on stage that was probably the catalyst for the four years between albums
7009790 its a logistical nightmare our band is but its something that we enjoy a lot more now that we do it less
7009791 it just went on hold im at a really good place in my life right now and its hard to write about that ive got to look to other peoples problems and tragedies to supply inspiration now its a cliche but its just so true im too damn happy

7009799 hes played very well today as he normally does in his position and i knew that he could probably be the deciding factor

7009801 we tried to make sure that we didnt get uptight just too play our own game
7009802 we wanted to play with intelligence and move the ball around and not run around so much we wanted the ball to do the work
7009803 no team has actually played at noon since we started this tournament
7009804 it affected both countries and most players didnt perform to their level because of the heat but we didnt make the rules they said play the game at 12 oclock which i dont think wasnt a good idea

7009824 why not go out on a limb thats where the fruit is
7009825 i may disagree with what you have to say but i shall defend to the death your right to say it
7009826 i did say last week that i wouldnt have to lower the standards but it looks like the quality players i want to bring in here might not be the ones that im chasing
7009827 we need to get numbers in its probably out of reach for us to bring in the six or seven we need now and theres a possibility we might end up bringing nobody in
7009828 we couldnt get through to january with what we have right now
7009829 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7009830 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7009831 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7009832 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7009833 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7009834 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7009835 i might end up having to change i did say last week that i wouldnt have to lower the standards but it looks like the quality players i want to bring in here might not be the ones that im chasing
7009836 we need to get numbers in its probably out of reach for us to bring in the six or seven we need now and theres a possibility we might end up bringing nobody in
7009837 we couldnt get through to january with what we have right now we have to make sure that the season isnt over before it has started so we need to get on with things there are no excuses there wont be any from me or the players
7009838 when you get close to the deadline the shutters in the shops are half down
7009839 i might end up having to change what im going for its beginning to look as if the quality players who i wanted are not there
7009840 if that was the case we could not get through to january we only need one injury at this present time and there have been periods throughout the summer when i thought we could be struggling to field a team
7009841 we have 15 pros and knew five with serious injuries were struggling for the start of the season
7009842 last year people were saying everton could be the team to break through and theyre not saying it this time why is that
7009843 i now have to look at bringing in five or six who would cost no money
7009844 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7009845 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7009846 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7009847 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7009848 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7009849 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7009850 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7009851 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7009852 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7009853 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7009854 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7009855 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7009856 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7009857 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7009858 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7009859 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7009860 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7009861 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7009862 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7009863 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7009864 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7009865 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7009866 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7009867 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

7009902 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7009903 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7009904 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7009905 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7009906 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7009907 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7009908 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7009909 the working day of an adult is not this long
7009910 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7009911 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7009912 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7009913 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7009914 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7009915 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7009916 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7009917 who are open to doing something on the production side
7009918 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7009919 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7009920 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7009921 externalists examine a machine or technology within a cultural system or ambience including studies of the reception of new machines examinations of workers response to new methods of production comparative work on technology transfer or studies of how a new machine or process changes hierarchical relations or social practices
7009922 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7009923 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7009924 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7009925 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7009926 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7009927 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7009928 das sch ne an dem produkt ist seine dynamik es ist eher ein fenster der m glichkeiten
7009929 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7009930 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7009931 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7009932 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7009933 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7009934 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7009935 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7009936 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7009937 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7009938 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7009939 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7009940 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7009941 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7009942 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7009943 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7009944 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7009945 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7009946 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7009947 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7009948 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7009949 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7009950 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7009951 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7009952 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7009953 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7009954 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7009955 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
7009956 i am a woman i have the right to change my mind
7009957 i asked the guys for it and they said yes were going out there to do it
7009958 im just happy and grateful because we worked hard for it
7009959 the judges have to press their buttons for the score and my colour obviously wasnt working
7009960 my foot hit her face and i felt it so it was definitely a head shot
7009961 i was absolutely in my zone i made one mistake and she caught me
7009962 he was absolutely brilliant he came back and did what we asked it was a big plus for steve and big pluses for all the boys
7009963 for steve to make a u turn at the last hour was magnificent and he delivered long may that continue
7009964 the boys did a good job i asked a lot of the lads i think there are a few areas we can still improve but all round i cant blame anyone
7009965 theres no point resting on our laurels though it is a long series there are still four more games to play
7009966 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
7009967 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
7009968 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
7009969 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
7009970 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
7009971 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
7009972 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
7009973 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
7009974 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
7009975 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
7009976 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
7009977 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
7009978 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
7009979 oh he he wasnt hurt as badly as we were led to believe
7009980 this will really help us under the cap if we say
7009981 we really hope he doesnt sign anywhere else because that would hurt us
7009982 gives a new perspective on the english civil war through the eyes of angelica fanshawe riseborough who is drawn to the anti monarchist cause at a time when england executed its king in favor of an alternative form of government
7009983 considering the british traditions of free speech and the individual and the british suspicion of organized crowds we would want to avoid the leni riefenstahl connotations which were there in beijing and the ceremony was too long
7009984 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
7009985 i cross examined a nurse one time and i intended to be all soft and kind and loving hugs and she started getting snarly with me and arguing and before i knew it there was blood everywhere
7009986 since then thousands of technical professionals from around the world have begun using it to save their web favorites online share them with others see what other technical pros are favoriting and connect with others
7009987 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
7009988 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
7009989 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
7009990 people want kosher food that is produced in an appropriate manner according to both ritual law and ethical law

7009993 much has been made in certain quarters about our religion but for forty eight years we have played a mixed team and some of the greatest celts we have had did not agree with us in our religious beliefs although we have never at any time hidden what these are men of the type of mcnair hay lyon buchan cringan the thomspos or paterson soon found out that broadmindedness which is the real stamp of the good christian existed to its fullest at celtic park where a man was judged by his football alone
