2260004 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
2260005 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
2260006 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw
2260007 the special cells of fighters will not strike against foreign forces until the situation becomes clear vis a vis the iraq u s agreement on the presence of american forces here
2260008 grows out of a climate of poverty and ignorance helplessness and despair

2260012 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example

2260040 in the future does microsoft plan to do an open source version of windows
2260041 well what does that mean an open source version of windows would mean not only would we publish windows source code we would make it free thats what open source means we wouldnt be hosting minority student day if we open source windows because we wouldnt have enough profit to pay people let alone invite in people from the community im not saying open source is a bad thing but it doesnt pay the bills in this company so we cant embrace that way of doing things we give out free soda pop to everybody who works here we make our stuff free people gotta give back the soda pop its just inconsistent with what we do around here
2260042 free software is a matter of liberty not price to understand the concept you should think of free as in free speech not as in free beer
2260043 an open source version of windows would mean not only would we publish windows source code we would make it free
2260044 microsoft is not in a position to re license windows this way their profit from selling windows licenses would plummet their stock would follow and steve would be in deep doodoo with investors and his remarks seem to imply that he knows this

2260061 ad tech chicago offers an inside look at the industry by professionals experiencing the same hurdles in reaching both broad and niche audiences
2260062 the challenge exists not in knowing who your target is but where and how to engage that person and understanding the various tools and mediums that help you get there
2260063 few marketers have a big idea behind their brands that can be expressed across the full gamut of consumer touch points advertising online and offline in store environment employee training product design etc
2260064 the best brand ideas ive seen have been grounded in a deep consumer insight or human truth are compelling enough to engage and excite consumers and seize some white space in the category in which the brand operates they represent a north star toward which all aspects of the consumer experience are relentlessly and obsessively directed
2260065 scarcity thinking includes such self defeating and usually unconscious beliefs as i cant make calls im afraid of rejection im no good at this and theres not enough business for everyone pearson explains
2260066 in fact more than 75 percent of our internal communication reinforces negative views about ourselves and the world which were often learned in childhood the constant repetition of this negative self talk sabotages our efforts behind the scenes creating the very thing we fear failure
2260067 to break through internal limits and reprogram a new deserve level your sales team must learn to think abundantly as a permanent habit
2260068 first change your thoughts then your actions will follow this means shifting your focus from scarcity to abundance by aiming your thoughts toward what you want rather than on what you dont want then expect that the desired results will be yours thats abundance thinking in a nutshell

2260075 everyone expected a normal market response to higher prices would be an expansion of production but that hasnt happened
2260076 the peak oil alarmists fail to say anything about the vast amounts of oil being found in the gulf of mexico now or the major deal that chevron just did in oil rich angola
2260077 producers such as venezuela could let production fall and nationalize the oil industry because there was no punishment for doing this when prices kept rising
2260078 proponents of peak oil who dont have the foggiest knowledge of petroleum geology

2260236 were a little disappointed that a long tradition of choosing successful olympic athletes for this honor has been broken
2260237 it has for years been a dream for dirk nowitzki to be at the olympics michael vesper general director of the german olympic committee said in a statement on wednesday
2260238 we have chosen him because he more than any other embodies the olympic idea
2260239 the era of easy choices about energy is long over
2260240 the group is open to all women who have a nationalist patriotic world view
2260241 there had been no indications that she was involved in the far right scene nothing in her conversation or her work
2260242 i was accused of indoctrinating children something that is totally out of keeping with the way i do things with my convictions with my beliefs
2260243 she was a woman who felt called to free her country and that is also something close to our hearts
2260244 many women dont know where to look for help or how to defend themselves
2260245 i am now trying to get funding at a state level and from the european union
2260246 the poor german people suffering because of oppression that is a constant rhetorical device
2260247 one has to keep in mind the long term goals of a party like the npd or other extreme right groups
2260248 its not really about intensifying or improving democracy but rather about limiting it and creating an authoritarian society
2260249 they themselves have a racist anti semitic homophobic and anti feministic view of mankind
2260250 they have always been there but before they were usually in the background
2260251 even if they claim that their work is non political they still convey a certain stance
2260252 children and young people have a right to receive an education and pedagogy that respects people without either open or subtle discrimination
2260253 you cannot separate her work from the fact that she was involved in a xenophobic organization
2260254 it fits totally with the idea of ethnopluralism the idea that various ethnicities and peoples are so different that they shouldnt mix
2260255 these women appear very moderate and eloquent friendly and supportive
2260256 that does not mean that they dont have a racist ideology
2260257 that doesnt make them any less dangerous quite the opposite
2260258 the race at the games will be just another race in my life
2260259 im happy that i dont have anything to do with it anymore
2260260 i lost my nerve and i simply got off to too hard of a start
2260261 the path of dialogue remains open but in the absence of a clear response iran is making the choice to expose itself to new sanctions
2260262 opposed to the spirit of the sanctions imposed by the un security council against iran
2260263 there is a kind of moral obligation to consider the sensitive conditions regarding business with iran and to impose a certain self restraint
2260264 the group of six world powers has a number of different motivations driving its decisions that confusion has so far blocked any effective sanctions from emerging nor however will there be any negotiations without preconditions as iran demands the primary beneficiary from this standoff has been iran which continues playing for time even if that means a risk of an attack from the us or israel there is little doubt that barack obamas pledge that he would negotiate with iran without conditions has entered irans political calculations thats what iran wants and thats why it will wait for the outcome of elections in the us
2260265 it is incomprehensible that the west continues this senseless game with iran about nuclear issues this strategy of sticks and carrots only hurts the wests economy and pushes iran even further into the arms of russia and china and its also a dangerous game to be playing because it could lead to war the consequences of such a war would be gruesome not only for iran and the region but also for europe and the united states
2260266 what is there to do in such an explosive situation we must negotiate with iran with all seriousness and without preconditions if doing so allows their uranium enrichment program to go forward for another few weeks or months the result would not immediately be the emergence of a bomb and if proposals are made that can help the regime save some face we can isolate the radicals and warmongers and win over the majority of the conservatives if washington continues to say no to this strategy and israel continues to threaten a military solution then the europeans need to take a strong position they would have russia and china on their side it is doubtful though whether they can really get the nerve up to do it
2260267 without even a blush germany is doing business with the world champion of anti semitism and undermining international efforts aimed at imposing sanctions on iran such is the tenor of the critique aimed at berlin for the last week
2260268 the case makes it clear that the government is disengaged and lacking in any sense of responsibility
2260269 the only remaining alternative to military strikes has yet to be tried in earnest imposing the most targeted and painful economic and political sanctions possible on the regime diplomacy without real pressure is just asking for failure tehran is just playing for time
2260270 it has been an eventful week with a lot of rumors and a lot of things that people come up with and i have no idea where its coming from
2260271 this defines where we are at and i am really excited about the opportunity that these guys gave me six years ago
2260272 we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake the test was just trying to get it on paper tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family
2260273 tony gave us our first pole our first win and our first championship and thats the kind of relationship that weve had
2260274 you know like so many families once in a while we have our squabbles sometimes they get pretty loud but i promise you that guy sitting up here theres nobody more motivated in the sport
2260275 theres still a few things to iron out but hes going to be here next year
2260276 now we can concentrate on finishing out this season strong and getting ready for next year
2260277 we thought we should have at least three of the four as championship contenders
2260278 weve been very competitive at almost every racetrack and thats probably the most frustrating thing weve been in the position to win quite a few races but either an incident on the racetrack has taken us out or driver error or in fairness some bad strategy on our part
2260279 i had a little meeting with them after the last race and i think we all are pretty much on the same page
2260280 there is no no 1 driver what has made this team work i think is that there isnt that its the four working together have we had that all year this year no has there had to be some reminders yes
2260281 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2260282 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2260283 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward
2260284 look everyone she has a dead frog on her buttttttttttt
2260285 but even if you should suffer for righteousness sake you will be blessed have no fear of them nor be troubled but in your hearts honor christ the lord as holy always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you yet do it with gentleness and respect having a good conscience so that when you are slandered those who revile your good behavior in christ may be put to shame
2260286 it really is like a homecoming for a lot of reasons
2260287 mike tom and the rest of the crew have been such a huge help to me this year and id really like to do well for them in their back yard plus ive done a lot of hunting in ontario for many years and my family has raced in canada forever its strange that ive never been to capital city but im really looking forward to it its a pretty special place for us already
2260288 youve got guys like karl allard alexandre gingras and jean fran ois d ry that are very good racers
2260289 ive raced a couple of times against them over the years and there are the veterans like claude leclerc and yvon b dard plus im sure there will be a lot of ottawa based cars it should be exciting
2260290 the united states should not be an atm for the iraqi government
2260291 its like saying once you get into willy wonkas chocolate factory and youre in the garden where everythings edible you have it all
2260292 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2260293 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2260294 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2260295 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2260296 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2260297 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2260298 penetration levels of humira within each of its six approved uses are still very low
2260299 abbot coming from nowhere now has the opportunity to be the dominant player in that market
2260300 youre getting the benefit of significant diversification across product areas on a global scale
2260301 carboncopypro is absolutely the simplest way to make money online this is the last business ill ever own the support from start to finish and the fact that these guys are continuously improving their internet marketing product to stay ahead of the competition makes this the internet business of choice we are thrilled to be a part of the carboncopypro internet marketing team
2260302 theres a strange band over there in the states called the trachtenburg family slideshow players their link is in my sidebar inevitably
2260303 dive if you can believe it ive actually seen the trachtenburg family perform live yes for 3 months in 2003 i lived in my sisters apartment in williamsburg brooklyn and got to see them at a local joint they were absolutely hysterical the daughter especially and i just loved what how they combined the slides movies and their music
2260304 now go do that voodoo that you do so well
2260305 holy fuck what kind of sicko deity does that to somebody
2260306 your aim is off youll have to do better than that beardy

2260308 everything has a spirit so treat it with respect or it might bite your ass

2260317 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2260318 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2260319 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this offseason
2260320 you see teams go out in free agency and spend on a lot of guys and everyone says oh theyre going to be great and go to the super bowl it takes chemistry and to me thats the most important thing you can have all the talent in the world but if the chemistry is not there it wont matter
2260321 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2260322 overall road america was a very successful weekend for myself and the brian graham racing team winning saturdays race and again being on the podium sunday scored us with great points for the championship consistency is going to continue to be important for us going into the last few rounds i want to thank brian matt and ian for giving me such a great car all weekend
2260323 these are all very good topics baka you can give the others that you will not do to your classmates who are having a hard time finding a topic hehehe
2260324 i stopped seeing things by class as its a lie that one is right just because he she is a laborer
2260325 att uppleva sin egen hj lpl shet och att tvingas acceptera svidande nederlag och till slut d r det pris jag mer n villigt betalar f r undret att ha k nt och upplevt nyfikenhet k rlek solidaritet och extas i mina lustupplevelser
2260326 i think at the end of the day we need to find out why the tire rubber would not lay into the track and why it turned into a powder
2260327 it appears that at the test session we didnt have that problem we had a lot longer runs on that tire we also saw this problem at dover where it just turned into a powder and didnt actually lay into the track so i think when we get to the root of that problem well be in good shape
2260328 what makes this win really special is scott fraser he was an awesome driver when they announced the winner of this race would get this trophy and that frank fraser was going to give out i thought that would be a great one to win
2260329 nascar has brought a new dimension to stock car racing in canada
2260330 i definitely want to add a nascar championship to the list
2260331 it was a pretty rough race all because everyone wanted that first one so badly its a win that no one will be able to take away from me
2260332 i really dont have a reason why i qualify so well my team does a great job adjusting the car to the conditions and the track every time out
2260333 i am just able to get a good feel for the car
2260334 in the canadian tire series all of our oval track events have pit stops so i cant say that it is critical but to have a clean track in front at the beginning when tensions are high and everybody is beating on each other is not a bad place to be
2260335 like i said with the pit stops anything can happen and the competition in this series has gotten such that anyone can win starting from anywhere
2260336 but its not over yet ive seen a lot of crazy things over the years i dont wish anything for him but if he keeps up the pace he is on then ill be the first in line to congratulate him
2260337 i could not see anything and the radio was not working
2260338 regardless i am very satisfied with my race because i kept the car on the track until the end and i was able to keep up with the leaders for a good part of the race
2260339 nascar has brought a new dimension to stock car racing in canada
2260340 i definitely want to add a nascar championship to the list

2260350 in the true spirit of sportsmanship for the glory of sport and the honor of our teams
2260351 right now it is a very special beijing right now it is the greatest time in china
2260352 here in the city theres been a buzz its been exciting over the last two years to see how the citys grown and to see how theyve built new buildings for the olympics
2260353 i think the government and the people who relate to the olympics specifically are expecting china to have its coming out party these next few weeks
2260354 as a result of that i think it will put china on the world stage

2260372 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one
2260373 i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principles of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading the muslims borrowed rituals and traditions from all the surrounding religions
2260374 when i was with my father i in effect pushed a moderate hamas leader into making logical decisions such as stopping the attacks and establishing two states alongside one another
2260375 i felt responsible it was better for me to be there rather than a gang of fools who would poison his mind
2260376 i tried to understand those people their thoughts in order to change them from inside by means of a strong person like my father who admitted to me in the past that he does not support suicide attacks
2260377 he thinks that harming innocent people gives the organization a bad name
2260378 i sat in megiddo prison and suddenly i understood who the real hamas was
2260379 these people have no morals they have no integrity but they arent as stupid as fatah which steals in broad daylight in front of everyone and is immediately suspected of corruption hamas people receive money in dishonest ways invest it in secret places and outwardly maintain a simple lifestyle
2260380 the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
2260381 i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
2260382 you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
2260383 they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed
2260384 are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise
2260385 many people will hate me for this interview but im telling them that i love all of them even those who hate me i invite all the people including the terrorists among them to open their hearts and believe
2260386 now im trying to establish an international organization for young people that will teach about christianity love and peace in the territories too i would like to teach the young people how to love and forgive because thats the only way the two nations can overcome the mistakes of the past and live in peace
2260387 i dont think id be where i am now without having the faith i have
2260388 i dont know that i would have been able to persevere without knowing that the lord was in control and he had his hand on me and was working through everything ive gone through
2260389 the americans havent won a medal in road cycling since 1984 so its been a long time
2260390 i think well come away disappointed if we dont win one
2260391 i think there were a lot of people praying for me at the time
2260392 i remember being an eighth grader and having a really good understanding of his grace and what it meant to be a christian
2260393 i think my faith was pretty far along pretty early
2260394 i knew there was something athletically special about what i could do but i kept getting hurt
2260395 i could never do enough miles to be competitive i walked to the other side of the track where the bleachers were i climbed to the top and sat there and cried for an hour and a half i sat in the cold i cried i prayed i sat in silence
2260396 all of a sudden you have a really clear understanding of what it means when jesus said to paul my grace is sufficient
2260397 at the time i was going through those four years it was such a roller coaster now when i look back im so thankful for it and i wouldnt change any of it because of how it built my faith and developed a foundation for me for who i am now
2260398 the people that knew me and had been around me knew that something had happened that i didnt do anything
2260399 my worry was more with the people who really didnt know me for me that was the hardest thing knowing that my witness was a little bit scarred in that sense but the people who knew me they knew my faith they knew my integrity and how i walked and that it was never something that i would intentionally do
2260400 i consider myself a christian before i consider myself an athlete
2260401 so how i act how i talk how i race i try to do that as a christian first im not going to put someone in the ditch i try to race with integrity and class i try to do things professionally in a way that hopefully accurately represents christ
2260402 the lords been good to me and hes always been there with me
2260403 ive learned to give thanks in all situations just knowing that the lords in control his plans are bigger and better than anything that i could ever imagine
2260404 thats my expression of worship ill be giving my best thank you performance on the water on the biggest stage in the world
2260405 it was kind of like the perfect storm the culmination of my parents going through this divorce and moving to a new place and disillusioned a little bit with rowing as well
2260406 one went off kind of cursing the coach and the system and saying it was completely unfair
2260407 the other girl even though she went through the same process seemed totally at peace with it she was also very genuinely encouraging to everybody
2260408 she seemed to always be smiling and she smiled so big that you could barely see her pupils
2260409 it really really bugged me because i had made the team and i knew the reaction i would have had if i had been cut
2260410 i knew i would have been more like the other girl
2260411 thats the first time id ever actually heard of that even being a possibility
2260412 i had no understanding of it before i grew up going to church as more of a social checkmark but i never really understood this whole personal relationship thing
2260413 i actually circled yes and i dont know why at the time
2260414 its like i walked into a whole roomful of lauras
2260415 for me its something that ive always wanted to be able to experience
2260416 laura had such an impact on who i was and obviously she led me without even using words necessarily
2260417 she led me to understand that theres more to life than what you can put on your resume whether its sport or academic
2260418 even though she didnt make the varsity team she had an eternal lasting impact on me
2260419 i want to be that same kind of role model with my team i want to be able to be christs light on the team
2260420 this is really a slap in the face to all the people who put in small amounts of money to fund the advertisement and so i guess theres a range of options at this point
2260421 it is so much easier to use my team that have signed up are very excited and think that the training is actually fun and they want to do it all at one time
2260422 wow this is cool or awesome and so easy i like it they are left excited and pumped up and ready to begin good job cutting edge media who ever was the web master of this web site is an absolute genius thank you so much for all that you do
2260423 i am so excited about all the features the audio recording the video recording the 5 and free the phone burner with an unlimited rate the voicemail system the bridge calls webinar capability it just keeps getting better and better i also loved the 2 archived dani calls in the training center and that mydfi participates in the y malawi project in africa sponsored by world vision i am proud to be a part of this team and to the leaders we can tell that when you put this together you have our best interest and success at heart
2260424 members will continue to attend first steps to success as this training is what has produced every six figure income earner in dfi we have just moved that training from dfilive com to mydfilive com
2260425 we are looking forward to the massive growth we experienced in the last year to multiply with this system it doesnt get more efficient or simple as this
2260426 using the ewordofmouth system we have seen a significant increase in our initial membership prospect list and regular customer base in less than one week
2260427 our regular clientele are clearly excited to be involved in the growth of our club judging by the number of online referrals they have given us
2260428 eliminating the nearly 80 000 per year spent in traditional advertising with ewordofmouth has been great for our bottom line today and for the future of bridges golf amp country club
2260429 in todays world marketing your company properly should always include e marketing
2260430 we think that ewordofmouth will help us to accomplish our marketing goals
2260431 southern chad is not a saharan area it is a place where you can have agriculture
2260432 there are local mechanisms mixed committees composed of locals and refugees for reconciling problems with herds
2260433 we do not know what will happen next but for the survivors of darfur the process initiated by the international criminal court is of immense significance in itself
2260434 the parliament is dominated by bashirs men the judiciary is incompetent and not able to provide justice the international community has for long turned a blind eye to darfur what other avenue do the people of darfur have
2260435 it may fail to arrest and bring president bashir to trial but the fact that the international community recognises the suffering of the people of darfur and is willing to go after those responsible for it means a lot to them it makes them feel they have an ally somewhere in the world who is willing to listen to their voice and support them
2260436 the sense of impunity he has had so far is gone for the people in the camps it is sufficient to know that someone is identifying those responsible for the crimes against them
2260437 his motives were largely political his alibi was a counterinsurgency his intent was genocide
2260438 so hes in charge of the same victims he displaced and hes attacking these people in the camps
2260439 the indictment should be viewed separately from the politics and diplomacy that has followed the icc is an independent body the prosecutor has gathered evidence after three years of painstaking effort by filing the charges and making them public he has done his job
2260440 we need to have a clear roadmap on how to resolve the darfur crisis
2260441 there is a need for the government of national unity to reach an understanding with the international community and cooperate on the legal aspects of the icc warrants
2260442 it is a serious situation and it could threaten the peace and stability if it is not well managed the main issue is to put a quick and fair end to the darfur crisis
2260443 there may be more room for compromise now by publicly listing his crimes and nominating him for trial the icc has brought the focus on bashir it is time for the international community to respond now
2260444 im bored and frustrated at being a prawn i wish i was a shark and then i wouldnt have any worries about being eaten
2260445 hes at home distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became a shark
2260446 its me justin your old friend come out and see me again

2260451 us energy demands are rising as the price of oil goes through the roof canadian tar sands and domestic coal would provide energy security but at the risk of increased global warming can renewables be developed in time
2260452 making a gasoline alternative to run our cars has great promise but there are huge problems the next answer may come from a uc berkeley lab a silicon valley start up or the jungles of costa rica
2260453 it appears that the whole report buys these dubious arguments that the consumer of energy is somehow stupid about energy
2260454 may be the first tentative step toward building a more sustainable energy economy or it may simply mean that when our energy system does begin to fail and we begin to lose everything that energy once supplied we wont be so surprised
2260455 growing economies of scale technological breakthroughs and rising costs of competing fossil fuels play in favor of renewables and official institutions like the eia or the international energy agency iea may be too conservative when they only assume a slight rise in relative importance of renewable energies until 2030
2260456 for the gcc countries and their most important export good it needs to be stressed that with the exception of biofuels renewables are used for electricity and heat generation
2260457 would only change if in the very long run alternative fuels or new technologies would be developed e
2260458 in terms of growth rates solar and wind energy have the highest growth rates of all energy forms worldwide considerable hopes are pinned to them and if renewable energies acquire a larger share of the global energy mix in the future it will come from these two energy forms
2260459 what developments could be expected within the next decade what is the worst case scenario effect on oil
2260460 land use for biofuels currently constitutes only 1 percent of total acreage worldwide 14 million hectares a figure that the iea sees increasing to 35 million hectares by 2030
2260461 biofuels are unlikely to lead to large scale replacements of fossil fuels due to limited availability of land competition with food production and a questionable energy balance in the case of ethanol production from corn
2260462 a detailed study by new energy finance assumes a number at the lower end of estimates with biofuels responsible for up to 8
2260463 research by the us energy department estimates that biofuel from algae could theoretically replace all the petroleum consumed in the us
2260464 high costs of fossil fuels alongside technological breakthroughs and decreasing costs with growing economies of scale will play out well for renewable energies in the future despite capacity constraints that need to be overcome renewable energies have developed into an industry to reckon with and are also underpinned by growing government support and concerns about global warming
2260465 the trans mediterranean renewable energy cooperation trec is pursuing the desertec project which aims at building large scale csp plants in north africa and transport the produced electricity via high voltage direct current cables to europe both already proven technologies
2260466 abu dhabis masdar initiative is the most significant initiative for renewable energy in the gcc thus far abu dhabi has taken on the saudi initiatives of the 1980s on a much larger scale in order to take advantage of the technological progress and the improved economics that have taken place in renewable energy since then
2260467 renewable energies are about to capture a significant portion of the global energy mix this portion is only likely to grow especially solar energy in the form of concentrated solar power csp and thin film pv cells integrated in buildings rising domestic energy needs for power generation and desalination favorable conditions for solar energy production and interest in acquiring technological know how make a perfect argument for renewable energy in the gulf renewable energies can stretch the lifeline of the gccs oil and gas exports and in some decades from now they even have the potential to develop into a major pillar of the economy energy created from renewables could gradually substitute oil as the gccs major export item
2260468 as such the amount of wind energy over land could potentially cover over five times the current global energy and about 40 times the current electricity uses with little incremental pollution
2260469 climate change and a billion dollar carbon market that trades in carbon credits as if they were pork bellies have created a new career niche
2260470 us energy demands are rising as the price of oil goes through the roof canadian tar sands and domestic coal would provide energy security but at the risk of increased global warming can renewables be developed in time
2260471 making a gasoline alternative to run our cars has great promise but there are huge problems the next answer may come from a uc berkeley lab a silicon valley start up or the jungles of costa rica
2260472 it appears that the whole report buys these dubious arguments that the consumer of energy is somehow stupid about energy

2260499 i liked pitt from the beginning and i thought it was a good fit for me
2260500 but what i liked a lot was when i was up there for the jam fest and saw how they all stuck together and hung out on and off the court i want to be a part of a family like that and it looks like thats what they have up there
2260501 i like their style of play and built up a good relationship with their coach jamie dixon
2260502 i like the fact that ill be playing in the big east and the fact that every night its a competition no matter who you are playing
2260503 i like the run and gun physical game they play and its something i definitely see myself doing i think the whole conference you have to be tough and pitt just adds more to it especially with the big men i like that style of basketball
2260504 this is a way to get the message into the mainstream
2260505 its irresponsible to let your children have unprotected sex and its irresponsible to not spay and neuter your animals when were in an animal overpopulation crisis in the united states
2260506 during the eviction campaigns after the election dispute threat of rape was usually the first warning and then it was used to humiliate rival communities and to force them to leave
2260507 there is no one time remedy for these victims recovery and rehabilitation if at all requires a combination of medical treatments and psychological therapies
2260508 the gvrc still receives patients suffering from trauma physical disabilities or pregnancies as a result of the election related violence
2260509 the stigma attached to rape victims ostracizes them socially and often leads to divorce and excommunication from the community
2260510 although the centre works with a number of lawyers groups to help the victims get legal aid only 20 of the 653 victims medically managed and counselled by the centre have decided to seek legal remedy
2260511 embarrassment is the biggest reason why most victims do not want to take the legal recourse but there are other realities as well the identity of the attackers is unknown in most cases evidence is hard to collect and it is even harder to prove a case in court
2260512 it is not that the laws are not there to deal with sexual offences but it is the implementation of those laws and prosecution that has proved difficult
2260513 in doing so we shall keep a balance between all the legitimate interests that this amnesty debate represents while helping the country to move forward on the basis of stability and justice
2260514 crimes against humanity war crimes genocide torture and sexual violence should not be amnestied justice is for both the victims and the accused
2260515 even if justice is not done in most cases it will be an achievement for official bodies like the waki commission and private charities like gvrc if our work made the country question its mindset of looking down upon sex crime victims
2260516 webster gave the wafer back but the catholic league a national watchdog organization for catholic rights claims that is not enough

2260523 ambystoma opacum differs from the other ambystomatids in at least three significant ways first it is a fall breeder migrating to carolina bays in advance of the significant rainfall that is required to fill the bays second females lay their eggs on land usually under a log or similar cover object rather than directly in the water finally once the eggs are laid the female stays to guard the clutch whereas other ambystoma in the southeast lay their eggs and leave when the bays fill water inundates the nest and triggers hatching females then leave their offspring behind and depart from the bay this unusual strategy virtually ensures that the young marbled salamanders are the very first salamanders to hatch each year which may give them a considerable advantage over potential competitors such as the larvae of other salamander species

2260555 because so few are thinking naturally there are found but a few to argue prejudice there is in abundance and sentiment too for these are things born of enthusiasm without the pain of labor thinking on the contrary is a difficult task it is the hardest work man can do that is perhaps why so few indulge in it thought saving devices have been invented that rival labor saving devices in their ingenuity fine sounding phrases like life is bigger than logic or progress is the spirit of the age go rattling by us like express trains carrying with them the burden of those who are too lazy to think for themselves not even philosophers argue today they only explain away at best both sides may shoot off firecrackers creating the illusion of conflict but it is only a sham battle in which there are no casualties there are plenty of explosions but never an exploded argument

2260649 the report is on a catalyst that forms upon the oxidative polarization of an inert indium tin oxide electrode in phosphate buffered water containing co2 a variety of analytical techniques indicates the presence of phosphate in an approximate 1 2 ratio with cobalt in this material the ph dependence of the catalytic activity also implicates hpo42 as the proton acceptor in the o2 producing reaction this catalyst not only forms in situ from earth abundant materials but also operates in neutral water under ambient conditions
2260650 we describe an air electrode based on a porous material coated with poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene pedot which acts as an o2 reduction catalyst continuous operation for 1500 hours was demonstrated without material degradation or deterioration in performance o2 conversion rates were comparable with those of pt catalyzed electrodes of the same geometry and the electrode was not sensitive to co operation was demonstrated as an air electrode and as a dissolved o2 electrode in aqueous solution

2260706 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
2260707 its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
2260708 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul collingwood and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
2260709 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring the team is properly prepared and plays to its full potential starting on thursday
2260710 south africa took an unbeatable 2 0 series lead when they defeated england in the third test at edgbaston in birmingham on saturday
2260711 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career
2260712 being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
2260713 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone
2260714 hopefully his captaincy will be similar to his batting positive instinctive and entertaining
2260715 the squad is made up of the players who have done so well for us over the past year and we have every confidence that they will regain the number one ranking on the reliance mobile odi standings from australia
2260716 the only player who is no longer part of the mix is charl langeveldt who is no longer available
2260717 langeveldt is currently playing for english county derbyshire on a two year kolpak contract south africa squad for the t20 international and 5 odis are as below
2260718 we have included hashim amla as the 15th player in the squad because of the heavy workload that graeme smith has had to carry and the injuries he has suffered recently hashim played in our most recent odi series against bangladesh and he will provide the cover in the opening batting area
2260719 including the warm up matches there are nine matches to be played in the limited overs section of the tour and the selection of an additional player is more than justified
2260720 the first game a t20 international will be played at durham on august 20th
2260721 we have extraordinary new developments in our region the major issue in this new investment is that the local indigenous hard coal will be fired in the new power plant in early next year 2009 the first unit with 165 mwe electricity generation capacity will be completed under the leadership of a former east european construction company the other two units each with 600 mwe will be completed by cmec of china within next 3 years

2260853 id just been cast as ingrid superstar in this play andy amp edie i wanted to be edie but misha sedgwick edies niece also wanted it so forget that i was eating in a restaurant with peter beard the photographer i was a kind of party girl for a while i met peter one night and we hit it off he said i should meet this guy jason
2260854 being an escort never crossed my mind it wasnt something girls like me did i was an actress from a very nice home but i was involved in an abusive relationship with this wall street guy
2260855 in the beginning all i wanted was enough money to move out
2260856 when natalia came over with peter i said wow shes so hot she has one of the all time great tushes but there was this other girl there too samantha when she took off her shirt she had these amazing breasts so it was natalias butt against samanthas boobies i went with the tits but when natalia came back from making a movie she moved in with us samantha could tell i was kind of more into natalia so we became boyfriend and girlfriend
2260857 i had on my little black dress and was shaking like a leaf
2260858 this is my boyfriend of six months the man i love i havent seen him for three weeks
2260859 thats the essence of the true gfe the girlfriend experience
2260860 what were selling is rocket fuel rocket fuel for winners
2260861 the most important thing was to break natalia out big
2260862 to get the ball rolling with a number of fabulous reviews i sent her to some friends to sort of grease the wheel i knew those 10 10s would keep coming because no man wants to admit he got less theyre brainwashed that way
2260863 dont break my girls streak this is history in the making
2260864 i always ask prospective clients to give me strong points about themselves where they went to school if theyre good looking it established rapport but also put them on the defensive let them know that i was interviewing them to see if they were good enough to go out with our girls
2260865 jason would be saying natalia is the greatest escort in the history of the world as good as cleopatra or joan of arc
2260866 and id be like jason joan of arc was not an escort she was a religious martyr then hed be saying i was the greatest escort since mary magdalene
2260867 from the start you know this is going to be fun
2260868 nat isnt this all knowing geisha thing but in a way its deeper because she gets to a place inside where you used to be free
2260869 with her theres none of that shit like this is costing enough for a first class ticket to london and the girls in the bathroom for like half an hour natalias this one total this is all about you
2260870 yes he sold the shit out of me but he sold me as myself someone anyone can be comfortable with someone who really likes sex because the truth is i do i loved my job totally
2260871 at the level ny confidential was at the guys i was meeting i would have gone out with 80 percent of them anyway people have so many misconceptions preconceptions about my life last year i got a call to play an escort in a broadway play but the part was so dark so icky i said no it didnt fit my experience at all
2260872 im not a big sports fan but i recognized him the quarterback
2260873 but once she started going she was unstoppable like the terminator
2260874 but you know you have a good client when you get la perla
2260875 sometimes hed say everyone gets a chance to spend time with you except me
2260876 the place was full of naked women and underwear it was a rain forest of underwear in the middle on the couch is jason with all these telephones one in either ear the other one ringing on the coffee table
2260877 a rush of power when the guy handed me the envelope
2260878 but i never felt i was in it for the money
2260879 to me the higher percentage of your life you are happy the more successful you are
2260880 i was really into the who is john galt atlas shrugged thing i thought i could save the world if i could bring together the truly elite people the most beautiful women with the most perfect bodies best faces and intelligence and the elite men the captains of industry lawyers and senators this would bring about the most happiness to the best people who most deserved to be happy
2260881 i stuck it in this 3 000 bottega veneta briefcase so hed notice it he said i was a nut job and to leave him alone i was so bummed i told him to keep the stupid briefcase
2260882 the best thing about bipolarity is how much you accomplish in the manic phase
2260883 it was like i went in there and never came out
2260884 certain kinds of visual stimuli signal that you are not in the real world avoid images that have depth which might provoke thought or guilt the more artificial the better luxury the sense that money has been spent or even wasted adds to the feeling that the real world of duty and morality has been banished call it the brothel effect
2260885 it was full of these familiar faces like a soap opera star a politician you might have seen on ny1 a guy whose photos in the times financial pages
2260886 we were actually trying to live a semi normal life carry on a real relationship
2260887 jason felt abandoned after his mother died my father left when i was very young we sort of completed each other
2260888 how am i going to have my mom come here
2260889 jason never closed the loft my mom and i stayed in a little apartment uptown jason was supposed to come by to meet her but it started getting late then the doorbell rings at 2 a m its jason in his knee length coat with these two 19 year old girls im totally flipping out
2260890 everyones partying having the best time in the world and the town car is outside to take me back to goddamn new jersey
2260891 i finally get home from my appointments all i want to do is sleep in my own bed and jason is screaming about how weve got to go back to hoboken he hated to be alone out there we had horrible fights one night i jumped out of the car right at the mouth of the holland tunnel and ran away broke my heel on a cobblestone
2260892 big shot lawyers and wall street bankers flipped when they saw the cameras jason told them the movie was no problem that it was a good thing if they didnt want to be in it they should just walk behind the camera thats jason if he was a billionaire and no one knew about it it wouldnt be anything to him
2260893 we told him that was insane money so he got mad and left
2260894 we had so much furniture there was nowhere to walk i used to jump over the stuff for exercise
2260895 we had this room upstairs we called the peter beard room peter likes to sit on the floor so we got these beautiful moroccan pillows one day i come home and theres a playboy pinball machine there with hugh hefners face on it then i knew there was no point saying anything
2260896 i hate that bitch she runs over sixteen people and thinks shes better than me
2260897 might have squeezed her hand too hard trying to get my keys back
2260898 maybe im just soft because after mona wrote the judge a tear stained letter how i never beat her up and how she loved me i forgave her
2260899 mona was a psycho bitch she hated me and now she was running the place
2260900 ive got this girl shes six one a rower on an ivy league college scull team shes cheaper than natalia and way better
2260901 mels my personal winston churchill and pauls the tough marine general
2260902 he was always in my place we all loved mel
2260903 well jason is a personable guy i liked talking to him it was an interesting place full of fascinating conversation a lot of business people financial people professional people
2260904 i never did any business with them i just thought it might open a new line of high priced clients
2260905 in one is the cops another the gangsters the third the screaming girl the fourth the secret service guy rubbing his eyes thats when i thought id take a vacation from this place
2260906 it looked like one of the cops recognized one of the gangsters
2260907 theyd knock on the door come in look around and leave
2260908 the place is being raided and were watching it on the internet
2260909 the cops were like ants over everything taking all the files ledgers computers on the couch were these people id worked with for months in handcuffs it was very weird
2260910 i was shopping for rugs with ed feldman who is kind of a legend in the fashion business
2260911 i immediately checked into the gansevoort hotel and began partying had a couple of girls come over because i figured i wouldnt be doing that for a while when the cops came i thought well at least im wearing my 2 800 rabbit fur lined sweater from jeffreys because who wants to look like a guy in a sweatshirt when they snapped on the handcuffs all i remember thinking was how i thought ny confidential would last for 25 years
2260912 he should be in jail if anyone laundered money its him
2260913 it is like i told the girls if you smile a fake smile keep smiling it because a fake smile can become a real smile
2260914 the problem with ny confidential was it didnt go far enough
2260915 if you really want to put together the elite people the best looking women and the coolest guys you cant stop with a couple of hours it has to be a lifetime commitment
2260916 i think i have a chance to do something good before i die
2260917 i was a young actress who came to new york like a lot of young actresses and i wound up with the role of a lifetime i was the perfect 10 i totally was it wasnt the rabbit hole i expected to tumble down but jason and i we were happy for a time really happy
2260918 to be the one who brought back the famous natalia
2260919 i say im retired in repose they say come on let me buy you a drink ill be good i tell them look we had fun and i love you but that is over mostly they understand some are willing to stay friends some cant wait to get off the phone theyve got other numbers in their book
2260920 the banks are more cautious about capital preservation soyoure going to see both the share repurchases and the dividendincreases be very slow if any
2260921 and with that kind of a trend they are going to bepretty conservative about dishing out more in the way ofdividends right now
2260922 the days of high double digit growth are over for a whileand the banks are just concentrating more on keeping theirbalance sheets and everything else clean
2260923 so the banks are going to wait until at least the lastquarter and maybe even next year before you start to see anydividend increases
2260924 i think both banks probably feel it is important tocontinue that dividend pattern so i dont think those those twobanks will miss dividend increase opportunities
2260925 so theyll do it but i suspect the dividend increasesare going to be tiny
2260926 if you asked me to god could i really do it
2260927 no other firm offers office space with as many benefits
2260928 we are pleased to be in the position to offer these servicies at this important time of growth in the hedge fund industry

2260932 and it looks like the slop you would get from a cafeteria straight from a cafeteria how do people eat that stuff
2260933 now what is that stuff called that is all sticky and sour that helps break the food down

2260940 second largest radio company based upon revenue in the country
2260941 i am delighted to announce the completion of this exciting merger between sirius and xm
2260942 we have worked diligently to close this transaction and we look forward to integrating our best in class management teams and operations so we can begin delivering on our promise of more choices and lower prices for subscribers
2260943 every one of our constituencies is a winner combined sirius xm radio will deliver superior value to our shareholders by offering more compelling packages and the best content in audio entertainment we are well positioned for increased subscriber growth our laser focus on subscribers will continue and listeners can be assured that there will be no disruption in service we also believe that the completion of the merger will eliminate any confusion that has been lingering in the marketplace
2260944 one of the most exciting benefits of this transaction is the ability to offer subscribers the option of expanding their subscriptions to include the best of both services given the respective popularity of exclusive programming on both sirius and xm we expect many subscribers will upgrade their current subscription
2260945 the upside potential for both consumers and shareholders is huge consumers have the ease of adding premier programming without purchasing a new device for shareholders this kind of organic growth is a key part of the companys future and the success we expect to see
2260946 in addition to realizing significant potential revenue growth the management team will move quickly to capitalize on the synergies that many analysts have predicted for this combination we expect to begin achieving those synergies without sacrificing any of the world class programming and marketing we are known for
2260947 we have all the tools necessary to begin executing as a combined company with high aspirations for subscriber growth and greater financial performance in part from the significant synergies that we begin realizing literally today on day one we are moving quickly to integrate the operations
2260948 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
2260949 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
2260950 due to the continue decline in the physical music market worldwide not being fully offset by growth in digital product sales
2260951 we have a great idea for kiss to go out and do big arena tour
2260952 im not going to teach your boyfriend how to dance
2260953 to date virgin continues to engage in the exploitation of electronic transmissions of the bands recordings without plaintiffs consent
2260954 we have been doing a lot of experimenting in the studio with dan hes made us record the album in a much wilder way than were used to
2260955 we did this thing in the studio called the doppler effect which is like when you are on the high street and you hear an ambulance go past and the sound of the siren pitch changes when it passes you
2260956 we were doing something similar on a track called what she came for we were recording the guitar in this big hall next to our studio and nick climbed into the ceiling and fed a microphone cable down through the rafters above the guitar speaker
2260957 then when we were recording dan was swinging this microphone above the guitar amp and we got this incredible sound
2260958 he finished it on monday sent it to me on tuesday and it was out this weekend
2260959 its just wonderful that you can actually do this the freedom an artist can enjoy these days is fantastic can you imagine me pitching this idea to a label
2260960 just the tip of a really large creative iceberg paul has been writing and recording at a furious pace
2260961 there are no plans or talk of doing any performances at the moment
2260962 i feel very sorry for a man who needs to lie about what was a perfect evening
2260963 after the show john rotten and management remained behind to sign autographs which we did for four solid hours without incident and had a great time talking to other spanish bands this seems to have sparked jealousy in certain bands
2260964 the trouble was brought to us resulting in those causing the trouble being physically removed by festival security
2260965 we are in the middle of a wonderful tour after 30 years we are achieving a true unity in our audience they are multi varied all ages all races creeds and colours
2260966 when you are at a festival with bands who are jealous fools lies and confusion usually follow if they need publicity so badly this is the allegation universe they run into
2260967 when you have achieved as much as i have come back and talk to me
2260968 its a shame that the wonderful world of the media is riddled with nonsense like this
2260969 when looking for my next project i was wary of musical protagonists but when john lennon was floated that vanished
2260970 i dont like double albums and i really wanted to make a short record everybody in the band felt the same way it was just the case of making a short record and feeling attachment to the songs and putting out a part two
2260971 thrust of production one of the fun things about working on the album was we felt a lot less sense of pressure
2260972 we used the same instruments and same methodology but by using themes from songs in other songs the stand ins comes back and elaborates on older tunes
2260973 something like if john lennon got together with miles davis and they discovered computers
2260974 sometimes theres an element of song structure that me and band member steven drozd get really bored of
2260975 but you can play certain things and the computer f cks with them in a way where its like oh i didnt think of that before
2260976 id never want to make it sound like imagine but some of these songs accidentally fall into that category
2260977 we never want to feel like weve got the answers to the world while were quietly going insane on our own level
2260978 im already writing songs for the new record and stuff
2260979 the process is weird because whenever we make a record the songs come from one or two years of life that youve lived
2260980 nathan and i have gotten over our past bullsh t theres no more real venom or puss left there
2260981 i dont think theres any weirdness there that would keep us from playing together again
2260982 we play it kind of like a midnight movie at these festivals mostly because we dont want to play it while a bunch of bands are playing
2260983 weve played it well into the night maybe six times now that group of people that comes in from two or three in the morning theyre usually the most insane theyve taken their acid or their mushrooms drank three or four red bulls and theyre really in it for the long haul
2260984 at first i didnt know if they felt they needed to be more respectful like its an art movie
2260985 so ive been doing these introductions like cheer laugh and smoke pot i dont think people have any idea what the film is is this funny is this serious is this weird once people understand its all that i think its a great relief
2260986 if you were to watch a david lynch movie with someone youd experience these moments where music story and abstract bullshit came together
2260987 youd understand it but you couldnt explain it to somebody else its like an unspeakable language
2260988 elements of it sound very much like bernard herrmann in a room with igor stravinsky and they hashed out you take this scene ill take this scene
2260989 my feelings about the city itself and how strong i believe it to be
2260990 those expressions of mine have never been a representation of my feelings about detroit the city a town that i have strong feelings about nor were they expressions about its citizens
2260991 the following poem is the detroit from my mind the detroit that is in my heart the home that encapsulates and envelops those who are truly blessed with the experience of living within its boundaries
2260992 id recommend a band not to go to any record label i think theyre all fucking rubbish
2260993 youre better off doing it yourself theyre living in the past its like owning a tram company or something
2260994 there is no cctv in the area and there are no apparent leads as to who is responsible for the theft
2260995 this is a very unusual theft and i am confident that someone locally will have knowledge about who is responsible or where the memorial stone is at present
2260996 it would usually have flowers behind it and mementoes to ian curtiss life
2260997 this has never happened before and we are agog that someones gone to the trouble of taking it out we are stunned
2260998 someones gone to a great deal of trouble to remove the memorial stone and i hope our appeal will help return it as soon as possible
2260999 we basically used to show each other song ideas and then that day turn the record button on having never rehearsed
2261000 this time we wrote the songs and rehearsed them and actually played them at a few concerts where we could play them straight through as a band
2261001 hes working with combinations of notes in a sort of very academic way which could be turned into anything we turned his ideas into something completely unlike what we would have foreseen
2261002 does feel much more upbeat and as much in your face as the sea amp cake can be
2261003 we showed up everybody had their ideas together and we worked them out in the studio quickly
2261004 that was pretty exciting we capitalized on having played live quite a bit in the not too distant past
2261005 i actually tried to get more of it on there
2261006 drummer john mcentire got them on ebay theyre super high end so theyre especially accurate and hi fi van dyke parks has a record called america which has steel drum all over it its an interesting pseudo homage in some ways
2261007 be doing a bunch of touring in the fall maybe not a bunch but most of the major cities a couple of weeks on the coast

2261013 i met the president yesterday it was kind of neat but a little underwhelming i expected a more commanding presence but it just wasnt there he appeared to be a pretty down to earth guy that you could just hang out with and shoot turtles

2261023 why did you decide to increase speed limits to 45mph on a road that runs through right through a district of single family homes surely it wasnt because of the interst of those homeowners

2261026 because so few are thinking naturally there are found but a few to argue prejudice there is in abundance and sentiment too for these are things born of enthusiasm without the pain of labor thinking on the contrary is a difficult task it is the hardest work man can do that is perhaps why so few indulge in it thought saving devices have been invented that rival labor saving devices in their ingenuity fine sounding phrases like life is bigger than logic or progress is the spirit of the age go rattling by us like express trains carrying with them the burden of those who are too lazy to think for themselves not even philosophers argue today they only explain away at best both sides may shoot off firecrackers creating the illusion of conflict but it is only a sham battle in which there are no casualties there are plenty of explosions but never an exploded argument

2261029 has a problem with him being gay and that is why he hit him with the baseball bat on sunday
2261030 obamaphilia has gotten creepy i couldnt figure out if the two canvassers who came to my door sunday had taken ecstasy or were just fantasizing about an obama presidency but i feared they were going to hug me
2261031 what the cult of obama doesnt realize is that hes a politician not a brave one taking risky positions like ron paul or dennis kucinich but a mainstream one he has not been firing up the senate with stirring cross of gold type speeches to end the war hes a politician so soft and safe oprah likes him theres talk about his charisma and good looks but i know a nerd when i see one the dude is urkel with a better tailor
2261032 obamas people are so taken with their messiah that soon theyll be selling flowers at airports and arranging mass weddings
2261033 have you noticed that hes actually carried into his rallies by a flock of cherubs while the heavens open up with the hallelujah chorus i wonder how he does that
2261034 and yet there was something just a wee bit creepy about the mass messianism we are the ones weve been waiting for of the super tuesday speech and the recent turn of the obama campaign
2261035 inspiration is nice but some folks seem to be getting out of hand
2261036 its as if former senate majority leader tom daschle d sd descended from on high saying
2261037 be not afraid for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people for there is born to you this day in the city of chicago a savior who is barack the democrat
2261038 the holy season of lent is upon us can obama worshippers try to give up their helter skelter cult ish qualities for a few weeks at least until easter or the pennsylvania primary whichever comes first
2261039 let me be clear im not saying there shouldnt be enthusiasm in politics im merely touching on the fact that some obama supporters exhuberance sic seems to be getting a little out of hand
2261040 nothing is more fundamentally powerful than how i felt when i met him i stood my hand embraced in his and i felt something something that i can only describe as an overpowering sense of hope
2261041 this time can be different because this campaign for the presidency of the united states of america is different its different not because of me its different because of you
2261042 be not afraid for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people for there is born to you this day in the city of chicago a savior who is barack the democrat

2261044 everyone is thinking of changing humanity but rarely thinks of changing themselves
2261045 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2261046 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2261047 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2261048 it is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path

2261057 vote as i say or ill publicly list your name among criminals
2261058 yes its expensive but sometimes ignorance is more expensive than knowing something about the people in our state we need to see are both ends of the spectrum
2261059 we need to see where the resource comes from but we also have a responsible to go to those places that arent as fortunate where they need different kinds of resources and different kinds of help
2261060 whoa aint she a little old to be listening to

2261062 youre not really going to take my picture with this this rabbit are you
2261063 to make it clear we the federal government are interested in the immobilizing security bracelet and look forward to receiving a written proposal
2261064 even though we had three children our family wasnt really fully complete and we knew there was such a great need in china
2261065 libby was found in a box outside of a police station when she was only a baby god led us to her and we got her from an orphanage when she was 1 year old
2261066 its that god had blessed us so much we wanted to bless another child
2261067 starting over with a baby at almost 40 was a challenge
2261068 but weve received more of a blessing than shell ever get from us
2261069 we like to say that theres international conflict every night in our house
2261070 when we get together its like a gathering of the united nations
2261071 we wanted them to see the environment libby was from to have an even greater understanding
2261072 my children have learned how to love others in a deeper way its been an enrichment to the whole health of our family
2261073 its a rocky road there are a lot of attachment issues they have from being in an orphanage
2261074 it made it difficult for her to trust us at first
2261075 and she brings an incredible amount of joy to our lives joy we never thought possible
2261076 we had teenage twins and i thought we were done my wife didnt though
2261077 shed been convinced for years and i finally saw beyond my selfishness
2261078 the biggest blessing is just to see this child who when we met her was basically a human being simply existing barely existing to see her bloom like a flower shes becoming the person who she is the way god fashioned her to be
2261079 he has used us in a small way both to rescue her and give her hope for the future
2261080 and he thought thats what you do to get brothers your mom does paperwork
2261081 when joshua was little he equated his birth with us getting him from china
2261082 the children have all been simply brothers and sisters from the beginning
2261083 how they became parts of the family has not been relevant to the fact that they are all equal parts while we hear questions from time to time the questions have little sticking power because they have been answered from the beginning both with words and with relationships
2261084 joshua asked me that once when he was 6 or 7
2261085 and i told him that there were parents in china who could not provide the care their children needed so they loved their children enough to put them in a safe place until their new parents could come get them
2261086 i have told them that their birth mothers were like moses mom who loved them enough to put them in a safe place so they could be found cared for and raised to love and serve god

2261104 may be the first tentative step toward building a more sustainable energy economy or it may simply mean that when our energy system does begin to fail and we begin to lose everything that energy once supplied we wont be so surprised
2261105 the future of our economy depends on investments in renewable energy sources like wind and solar power we already know that hundreds of thousands of americans work in jobs that could contribute to a green economy failing to extend these tax credits would be a missed opportunity to simultaneously create jobs and make our country more energy independent while at the same time doing our part to improve the environment for our kids and our grandkids

2261111 half the utilities on the trip really had done nothing or little solar installation it was a complete eye opener for them
2261112 its plug in and play literally you buy a solar panel and put it on your roof drop down two wires and call the electric utility its an order of magnitude faster than where we are today
2261113 every single utility would decrease the time they said it would be before solar would be a significant part of their utility mix

2261129 you have to start with the recognition that most wells drilled in the rockies are not oil wells they are gas wells there would never be an expectation of huge returns on the oil side
2261130 weve turned our western lands into a pincushion and gasoline is 4 a gallon and the price of natural gas has gone through the roof
2261131 because we are a frontier region its heavier lifting to build the infrastructure to ship energy from where its produced to where its needed
2261132 if you restrict drilling youll go from a situation where were growing one billion cubic feet in production a day to a situation where youre flat or declining in two years
2261133 opening protected areas of the coasts or public lands to new leasing is not going to lower the price of gasoline
2261134 there is obviously in the rockies a tremendous amount of industry investment it is reasonable to expect that surge will bear fruit with new production over the coming decade
2261135 what these data show is that conservation and renewable energy are likely to be the solution to our energy woes
2261136 on the oil side the data show that theres just not that much oil out there in the west

2261164 parents do not have a constitutional right to home school their children
2261165 we conclude that california statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education
2261166 i have never seen such an impressive array of people and organizations coming to the defense of homeschooling the team effort was remarkable
2261167 parents have a constitutional right to make educational choices for their children
2261168 thousands of california families have educated their children successfully through homeschooling were pleased with the courts decision which protects the rights of families and protects an avenue of education that has proven to benefit children time and time again
2261169 under these circumstances it is our view that the proper course of action is to interpret the earlier statutes in light of the later ones and to recognize as controlling the legislatures apparent acceptance of the proposition that home schools are permissible in california when conducted as private schools

2261177 amends the california constitution to provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
2261178 the ags job is to apply the law in a way thats fair to all californians not in a way that influences elections we will immediately appeal the ruling because the purpose of this amendment is to protect marriage broadly as the union of one man and one woman
2261179 the wild world is becoming so remote to children that they miss out

2261185 its just a cultural thing to offer someone something when they come into your home and normally its coffee
2261186 if we came in talking about the bible or jesus first thing wed be shooting ourselves in the foot because they would put up their wall and they would not want us to cross that wall
2261187 i actually think most of the time were not even sowing seeds were breaking ground
2261188 we have to go in and break that hard crusty spiritual soil before we can even plant a seed and thats the relationships
2261189 i cried because i was just waiting for someone to tell me about christ
2261190 from the very beginning of our missionary career weve seen this as a heavy oughtness
2261191 its really not that we feel talented or that we feel were professionals in this its just something that ought to be done that needs to be done
2261192 we believe what its going to take to win this area for christ is to train nationals venezuelan nationals who are willing to come up here and live here
2261193 or even better is to raise up and grow our own disciples grow our own agriculturists to reach their own people
2261194 we are sure that this is nothing more than imposing the reform project that was rejected in december
2261195 change faith or proceed with regular marriages without the authorization of a parent or guardian
2261196 the local police and ehsan ul haq a muslim member of punjab assembly are completely in favor of the abductors
2261197 that is why we are not getting justice and are still struggling for the recovery of the girls
2261198 the muslim majority including the police are either actively or passively aiding the abductors a common phenomenon in muslim majority countries such as egypt where coptic girls are regularly abducted
2261199 the police who have done nothing to restore them to their parents are making themselves accomplices of the kidnappers
2261200 are subject to violence intimidation torture rape false imprisonment forced conversion bonded labor forced marriage and child kidnapping
2261201 have either failed or have been watered down because of opposition from islamist and conservative islamic forces in pakistan
2261202 law enforcement and legal authorities in pakistan do little to protect christians
2261203 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
2261204 its a visible symbol of anti muslim feelings in europe
2261205 we already have more than 6 000 mosques in europe which are not only a place to worship but also a symbol of radicalization some financed by extreme groups in saudi arabia or iran
2261206 sometimes in intervals of about 15 minutes at a time
2261207 you know at that moment ive got to say larry i mean it was i was crying out to my to my father
2261208 i was crying out to the guy that i know as my heavenly father
2261209 and until you walk through that i think im not sitting here saying you know im so were so strong and i made even a choice to do that
2261210 right after the accident i started just running because i just didnt know what else to do
2261211 i just wanted to run and just be away as far away from the site of the accident as possible and just started running and was planning on just running as far as i could
2261212 and then caleb not too long after that just kind of ran and tackled me and just kind of jumped on me
2261213 and it was just like you cant leave you cant leave and just was just on top of me saying everythings going to be ok we love you you cant leave and just it was just that that was super important
2261214 i do remember running around to the back of the house and finding my wife of course just in hysterics
2261215 it was a lot of blood and i you know of course began just you know reminding god of all the great things he had done through history and that he could you know give her life again he could breathe life back into her
2261216 maria had the morning of the accident drawn a picture of a flower and had written a word that she had never written before
2261217 and when she first died caleb and i especially kept saying if we could just see if we could just have a dream something god wed believe it if we could just see something that would tell us that shes ok
2261218 and the day after the accident we went home to get some clothes for the funeral for the memorial
2261219 sitting on the art table was this little picture that maria had drawn the morning of the accident she had drawn a six petaled flower and only one petal was colored in we have six children only one is whole now we believe in the arms of jesus
2261220 and so the way im going to live my life from here on out is not be ashamed of what ive been created to do and thats just share the gospel share marias story and by sharing marias story i get to share the hope that i found through tragedy
2261221 i would say be really slow to feel like you have to say anything
2261222 in fact the most comforting things that we heard and thats probably the best way for me to answer it is when people would say you know what there are no words
2261223 even as we were in the emergency room grieving the immediate news of maria going to heaven i immediately thought of the people of china and i thought we have a comfort
2261224 we dont have words we dont have an explanation as weve fumbled over trying to explain how why all that but we do have a comfort and we do have a hope
2261225 i know a lot less about god but the things i know about god i know a whole lot more for sure
2261226 its a great day in the life of truett mcconnell college and georgia baptists the tmc board of trustees is extremely excited about the future of our school under the leadership of dr emir caner
2261227 bring to truett mcconnell a level of christian education that will raise the bar academically but also manifest itself in the life of the students
2261228 a scholar a professor a writer a preacher and an experienced administrator a powerful combination of gifts at the same time he has a vibrant personality and is easy to know he has a contagious warmth is enjoyable to be with and is an excellent conversationalist
2261229 gods leading is evident in the calling of dr emir caner as the new president of truett mcconnell college i sincerely believe that dr caners presidency will be characterized by unprecedented expansion of our student body by strengthening our readiness to serve the lord through christian education and by rapid growth of our financial resources
2261230 a nationally recognized college that is based on the word of god
2261231 thoroughly equip students to engage the culture with a distinctively christian and baptist worldview being christian is important but we need to build on those baptist distinctives that make us unique
2261232 that equips students to engage the culture with a dynamic witness that changes the world by changing lives
2261233 a parent should choose a christian higher education for their child because of the investment in the students mind
2261234 a christian cannot be defined by what he or she does but by their character that character in turn is formed by the investment of professors and staff who pour themselves into a student who will gain a thoroughly christian worldview
2261235 we need to have a solid biblical curriculum for our students on this campus we are going to pour our lives into missions christian studies and related areas there will be a wonderful blend of students graduating from tmc and walking into the secular world and into ministry positions both equipped with a solid christian worldview
2261236 with my muslim friends around the world i hope truett mcconnell will be instrumental in playing a small role in reaching some of the worlds 1 3 billion muslims many who now call the united states their home
2261237 if there is anything good that came out of 9 11 it is that americans have become more open to discussing religion and matters of faith
2261238 we at truett mcconnell hope to produce students who can move into this new culture with a dynamic faith that will change lives i want to be sure that students walk out of here regardless of their profession who have a passion for the lord and for sharing him with others
2261239 the muslim community across the world has been facing atrocities sponsored by the united states the deal with an anti muslim country should have been opposed by the iuml

2261241 poor charles was so embarrassed when he realized what hed done
2261242 he genuinely had no idea about her raunchy stage act he gnawed his fist to within an inch of its knuckle when his aides explained what sort of dancing she did for a living
2261243 she was stunned when he suggested the idea explaining that his son loved a good dance
2261244 id go around transforming i created myself i called myself a self made schizophrenic
2261245 nobody really knows because your grandfather didnt exactly save that kind of literature
2261246 but as bad as you can possibly think he guarantees that it was worse
2261247 jump on a car and say ah there you are and take in the sights with me
2261248 we moved back here because we really wanted to raise our son in colorado and not in vegas
2261249 but weve moved back here five times before and had to leave each time to find work
2261250 thats the reason i am so passionate about this show i really want it to be the reason i dont have to leave colorado again to do what i love to do
2261251 i dont want to have to leave again but i dont want to have to quit singing

2261255 to me truth is not some vague foggy notion truth is real and at the same time unreal fiction and fact and everything in between plus some things i cant remember all rolled into one big thing this is truth to me
2261256 in a conversation between waugh and graham greene recorded by christopher sykes greene described the plot of his then impending novel
2261257 a relief not to write about god for a change
2261258 oh i wouldnt drop god if i were you not at this stage anyway it would be like p g wodehouse dropping jeeves halfway through the wooster series
2261259 im in awe of the news junkies who can watch three screens at once and maintain their up to the minute data without plunging into despair or cynicism but i have a different sort of brain for me knowing does not replace doing i find i sometimes need time off from the world of things i cant do anything about so i may be granted as the famous prayer says the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference
2261260 the one eyed monster and why i dont let him in
2261261 have you some more typing to do tonight miss murchison
2261262 got to do the whole bally thing again said miss murchison left out a paragraph on page one it would be page one of course and he wants the tripe round at hansons by 10 oclock
2261263 those machines make you careless he reproved her in the old days clerks thought twice about making foolish mistakes when it meant copying the whole document out again by hand
2261264 we must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline we must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force the marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the negro community must not lead us to distrust of all white people for many of our white brothers as evidenced by their presence here today have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny and their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom we cannot walk alone
2261265 martin luther king was a fraud not a great man he plagarized big sections of his thesis so he was no doctor he plagarized or had jewish communists write his speeches

2261267 climate change and a billion dollar carbon market that trades in carbon credits as if they were pork bellies have created a new career niche
2261268 us energy demands are rising as the price of oil goes through the roof canadian tar sands and domestic coal would provide energy security but at the risk of increased global warming can renewables be developed in time
2261269 making a gasoline alternative to run our cars has great promise but there are huge problems the next answer may come from a uc berkeley lab a silicon valley start up or the jungles of costa rica
2261270 it appears that the whole report buys these dubious arguments that the consumer of energy is somehow stupid about energy
2261271 may be the first tentative step toward building a more sustainable energy economy or it may simply mean that when our energy system does begin to fail and we begin to lose everything that energy once supplied we wont be so surprised
2261272 the fact is we have to drill here and we have to drill now and we have to drill immediately i believe that its vital that we move forward with that solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more
2261273 thats what he talked about yesterday i want to drill here i want to drill now i dont know where he was standing i think he was in a building somewhere this plan will not lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration
2261274 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars energy crisis solved ill see you at the debates bitches
2261275 mccain represents four more years of oil companies calling the shots after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
2261276 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote
2261277 daniel is 5ft 10in but when they put me in heels i was taller than him and it
2261278 the whole point of bond is that he is masculine and hunky and he has to be taller than his girlfriend
2261279 daniel had to wear shoes with a lift in them and stacked heels for a few scenes but he took it very well he thought it was funny
2261280 lets just say i am somewhere between 5ft and 6ft
2261281 climate change and a billion dollar carbon market that trades in carbon credits as if they were pork bellies have created a new career niche

2261286 the question isnt if federal legislation will come but rather when and in what form
2261287 the cyclists were the first athletes to be seen wearing masks or doing anything proactive to combat the effects of pollution
2261288 this is really a surprise because i didnt think it was going to be such a big deal
2261289 why we wore the masks is simple pollution when you train your whole life for something dot all your is and cross all your ts why wouldnt you be better safe than sorry
2261290 page but mainly because i can never decide what to add because there literally is so much music that i love and listen to regularly what im about to write deserves its own post without a doubt though
2261291 dang this girls got it bad for me if shes getting me gifts already
2261292 now some may ask why i used my password in the clear in the first place
2261293 theres no good answer to this question though i will say the application i was using does not require ssl vpn secure sockets layer virtual private network for remote access previously a similar application we used here at eweek did but with it no longer necessary to log in i got out of the habit of using the ssl vpn client on my computer
2261294 speaking french they acted excited and furtive like they were doing something they werent supposed to be doing like boys sneaking a peak at dads playboy magazines
2261295 some joke snooping on other journalists passwords in the press room maybe they were confused about the purpose of the wall of sheep which is designed to keep security professionals attending the show on their toes
2261296 i learned that while it may not exactly be a badge of honor to get hacked the odds of it happening are higher the longer you hang out with hackers
2261297 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2261298 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2261299 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2261300 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2261301 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2261302 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2261303 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2261304 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2261305 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2261306 keith and i are both appealing to the press just to give us a little space so we can walk around sydney and show the baby our town
2261307 until dogs and cats can go on the pill or wear condoms we need to help them practice safe sex by spaying and neutering
2261308 millions of homeless animals are turned in to shelters every year because there simply arent enough good homes for them all

2261315 when bob demanded famously just give us your f ing money and i quote him directly he didnt plan it to be handed over to a warlord
2261316 into google you get about 35 100 results whodve thunk it
2261317 the characters we present on stage are who our audience is interested in were trying to preserve some mystery and create a fun fantasy
2261318 the idea behind it is im going to be that girl that starts the race with a flag in the middle and the cars take off and go by next to me ill be in a cutesy red pin up style strapless puffs out dress with red polka dots cardigan sweater and white gloves as im taking everything off im turning into a bad girl
2261319 im just really interested in the 30s 40s and 50s im fascinated with everything about that time
2261320 its burlesque not stripping its its own kinds of dancing and i love the music it brings that inner sex kitten out
2261321 they are a little risqu but professional theres no nudity
2261322 the way they dress is old and thats the way i like to dress
2261323 the girls are not these skinny mini perfect playboy models theyre real girls its sexy
2261324 i might be a little camera shy but you kind of act how the song goes you want to play that role
2261325 she is smart sexy funny and knows the stripper business from all sides heather will be the color commentator for the competition and i dont think there was a better choice on all of planet earth
2261326 besides vegas is my home strippers are my sisters and these guys produce hot shows labor day weekend my favorite place what could be better
2261327 im doing this a long time but between music burlesque celebrities and strippers this might be the greatest talent lineup weve ever assembled
2261328 then again we wanted to go over the top because its vegas baby
2261329 the curvier you are the better with more hips and shape you are better able to hit it bump and grind it
2261330 im obsessed with it its so gorgeous you can be so feminine or cheeky and funny
2261331 i just love being in a corset and i just love the voluptuous ladies and their curves you dont have to have what society deems a perfect body you can be any shape and it is just gorgeous
2261332 we decided we would do something thats a life changing experience
2261333 the charity were supporting helps the people we work with who are often overlooked
2261334 we thought we would help the people we see every day

2261339 whereas then your audience was primarily made up of men now you have a 50 50 audience
2261340 i think there is this desire to put the tease back into sex to put the imagination back into sex to take ownership of your body of your sexuality and i think women who perform in the neo burlesque movement have taken that voice back to it
2261341 at the workplace the more feminine you are the more credibility you lose
2261342 this is a parody its really drag its almost playing a woman
2261343 1 the act of pondering meditation 2 the act or process of chewing cud
2261344 unless otherwise noted scripture quotations are from the holy bible english standard version copyright 2001 by crossway bibles a division of good news publishers used by permission all rights reserved
2261345 use the act of burlesque to tell the story at a different level
2261346 all rights and inventory including masters of the film slick city
2261347 just as we stated in our complaint dita always owned the rights to slick city and any claim she relinquished her rights was false
2261348 a victory for dita as it achieved precisely what we sought dita again has ownership in the slick city intellectual property and she got back the masters of the movie all all the slick city inventory
2261349 a blue light silhouettes the sax man as one of the sexy sensual dancers slowly slinks down the stairs to the stage and leans out over the crowd holding on with only a handful of the world famous curtain of pearls jaws drop and drinks are ignored as the tempo picks up and the dancer steps up shedding boa gown and gloves towards the electrifying finale
2261350 just taking off your clothes and running around is kind of a free spirit thing
2261351 somehow and were not sure exactly how this happened someone had alerted members of the grand rapids police department that we were doing all sorts of illicit acts on stage some say involving live animals and basically that we were just a seedy sex show in a public bar
2261352 so they just bust in at the end of a show questioned everyone in the audience about exactly what kind of acts they saw it was just blown so out of proportion that it was almost kind of funny
2261353 we started getting monitored by private individuals who were keeping tabs on us and would complain to the police endlessly and that forced the police to keep an eye on us they eventually got sick and tired of it because they had better things to do
2261354 really the burlesque dance accounts for one fourth of the show
2261355 puts it in a very safe context its not some seedy club with the lights down low and girls grinding on poles its safe bawdy fun
2261356 that was very weirdly entertaining and i dont know why
2261357 one of our most famous dancers lala vulvaria she did an oscar the grouch striptease for the last show
2261358 i bring the hoop up and down play with it off my body and i also incorporate striptease within that act
2261359 its not about taking it off what its about is the tease
2261360 its about really celebrating that everybody is beautiful for whatever quirks or body types as long as youre up there just workin it and fully exuding your potential as a vibrant sexual being thats whats so exciting about it
2261361 women love the show sometimes almost more than the men
2261362 they can be more vocal about it hootin and hollerin sometimes the men can be more timid especially if theyre coming with their significant other
2261363 i pick on systems or things that annoy me then i take it way too far
2261364 yana doesnt care what other people think and i have a tendency to care too much
2261365 in a lot of ways yana is my polar opposite
2261366 these are the sorts of thing i struggle to convince myself of but at the same time clearly i believe those things or i wouldnt have created the character
2261367 i came out with a little diploma and graduated and decided acting wasnt what i wanted to do
2261368 i couldnt even fit into the pants theyd want me to wear
2261369 i always knew i was most powerful when i could tell a story through song its where i feel most free and comfortable
2261370 i know that sounds wanky but i think everybody has their own experience of her to some people shes a mother shes a sister shes an aunty a woman that you once knew or a woman you never want to know i think about her like an archetype from mythology so i can separate myself from her but it also gives me a lot more freedom in the characterisation if i dont pigeon hole her
2261371 ive realised since i started performing her that shes a little bit like my grandma
2261372 and a bit of her is from two other people i know who shall remain anonymous during the process of creating her i didnt have any idea where she was coming from as i get to know her more i realise all these unconscious things its kind of spiritual i think creativity and art are spiritual in a way
2261373 we had a couple of walk outs at the melbourne fringe i think maybe theyd just looked at the picture and not read the blurb about the show
2261374 people say oh shes foul mouthed potty mouthed shes this or that yes she is but shes also many other things
2261375 some people love her some hate her some are scared of her
2261376 looks a little bit like she might be traditional cabaret
2261377 we played the adelaide cabaret festival where the demographic was an older middle to upper class crowd
2261378 i was expecting some walk outs there but it didnt happen
2261379 i teach every single week twice a week and every time i get new students they realize how feminist what theyre doing is
2261380 for them feminist was burning your bra and taking off all your makeup and letting your hair grow
2261381 because its women saying i can be ultra feminine and i can shave and wear makeup and red lipstick and g strings and pasties
2261382 cheryl called me and said she had an exciting project for me to take on
2261383 were all made up of professional actors singers and dancers in kansas city
2261384 youve got professional performers doing something out of their element and theyre good at it we do have ladies of all shapes and sizes but everyone is very pretty and very classy in everything we do i really think what made it work was the girls coming from a stage presence background we didnt know what we were doing but we had fun
2261385 i had no idea this revival was happening until people started sending me e mails
2261386 after the 80s and 90s youve got your theater audience wanting more edge and then youve got people who are bored with the strip clubs and getting the obvious so i think people are trying to have fun by coming and getting the whole performance art quality
2261387 its going to be a send up of all the game shows we know and love
2261388 theres going to be a little dating game a little price is right and a few that are wholly new inventions
2261389 neo burlesque is an attempt to elevate burlesque to the level of art but i think some burlesque is art and it takes a certain level of talent to go there
2261390 one thing people need to remember is that burlesque was not high brow art i think some people take it a little too seriously especially the attempt to completely disassociate it from like stripping but theres more to it than your typical strip o rama
2261391 i think what we have to rebel against now is a bit more complicated than the original morals they were rebelling against
2261392 i think burlesque now allows us to make comments about sexuality it gets to a point where so many images of what a female is supposed to be and what a male is supposed to be get so overwhelming its like a pressure cooker im tired of looking at paris hilton i think burlesque is what happens when you cant take it anymore
2261393 i have nothing against commercial stripping as a business but it is that
2261394 ive spent many hours in the past several months trying to get action from our city to cause the clean up and maintenance of the cesspool which runs through our golf course adjacent to shore 4 and 5 harbour 4 5 6 7 8 and 9
2261395 with this channel blocked on both ends a stagnant pool of water has developed which continues to deteriorate because of lack of maintenance
2261396 yeah you know i get a little each month but not enough to live on
2261397 ive got a big problem doctor every time were in bed and my husband climaxes he lets out this ear splitting yell
2261398 thats completely natural i dont see what the problem is
2261399 johnny why are you doing your math multiplication on the floor
2261400 cheryl what was the most important thing we didnt have 11 years ago
2261401 guess what mom we were all square with seconds to go and i scored the winning goal everybody loves me the yanks the media and the fans
2261402 let me tell you about my day your father was shot in the street and robbed your sister and i were ambushed and raped and your brother joined a gang of looters all while you were having such a great time
2261403 its your fault we moved to new york in the first place
2261404 why are you wearing your wedding ring on the wrong hand
2261405 is it true dad that in some parts of india a man doesnt know his wife until he marries her

2261562 i was cooling out and surfing in costa rica and the bahamas
2261563 and ran into people from all kinds of places i noticed everybody was listening to classic soul music when i came back home the music for this album flowed organically naturally since i have my own studio i was able to perfect it take my time to make it right i was able to live with it day after day and that had a lot to do with how the album turned out

2261582 this decision about president musharrafs impeachment is going to open a pandoras box
2261583 if the government is set on having a showdown now it will have to accept a high degree of risk zardaris coalition can win it all if parliament can find the two thirds majority it needs to oust musharraf as long as musharraf accepts his fate but the coalition could just as easily lose it all if musharraf launches another coup d tat that would destabilize the country even further and bring an abrupt end to the hoped for transition to democracy initiated by the most recent elections
2261584 it would be much better if the government first took some time to look after itself and address pakistans pressing problems but if the coalition is determined to oust musharraf now you can only hope for the coalition and for pakistan that musharraf plays by the rules of democracy
2261585 the story behind the power struggle in islamabad involves the fight over musharrafs re election and his sacking of the supreme court justices but thats not all in many remote parts of pakistan where government power is tenuous there has been an increase in radical islamist forces which have always been opposed to musharraf as they see it the president continues to toe the wests line too much the parties of the ruling coalition cannot remain unaffected by this pressure either as a final recourse for avoiding impeachment proceedings musharraf always has the option of dissolving parliament and calling for new elections
2261586 sixty years after being founded pakistan might finally become a democratic state no one in pakistan wants to see musharraf remain in power at the same time though a number of western countries particularly the us seem to still believe that musharraf is their man and musharraf has often warned that al qaida would overrun the country were he no longer in office but those who agree overlook the fact that musharraf even as he is a bulwark against fanaticism in pakistan is also one of its causes musharraf has so weakened the country with all his cunning maneuvers that radical ideas have found room to expand in certain segments of the country and society in reality the best way to fight radical islamism in pakistan would be to bring an end to musharrafs political career and strengthen the countrys democracy
2261587 no democracy no civil rights a lack of equality and fairness only double dealing and treachery

2261592 that is what we feel though were not allowed to say it in public
2261593 this is the question that many chinese are asking themselves
2261594 these days i wonder if the olympic games have not played a role in nipping this whole debate in the bud
2261595 many chinese who are very proud of the fact that their country is putting on the games
2261596 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country

2261638 this just proves how important a device the mouse is
2261639 todays tv works as a computer and todays computer works as a tv
2261640 the devices we use have been modified for our changing lifestyles but it doesnt negate the value of the mouse
2261641 the mouse will be even more popular than it is today as a result
2261642 bringing technology education and information to these parts of the world will be done by accessing web browsers and doing that in the ways that we are familiar with today and that is using a mouse
2261643 there are around one billion people online but the worlds population is over five billion
2261644 with the wii you point and shake and it vibrates back at you so you have a two way relationship there
2261645 the new generation of smart phones like the iphone all now have tilting mechanisms or you can shake the device to do one or more things
2261646 even the multi touch interface is so much more powerful and flexible than in the past allowing you to zoom in scroll quickly or contract images

2261648 cheney plans to speak on the first night of the convention in st paul minn the same monday night that president bush will speak there had been doubts about a speech by cheney who remains unpopular with americans
2261649 you know there will be days when youre so tired that you cant take another step the night will have no stars and youll think youve gone as far as you will ever get you and me walk on walk on walk on cuz you cant go back now
2261650 watching the hilton video a few questions came to mind first why is that paris hiltons fake ad includes more substantive talk about energy policy than john mccains real ad second if writers helped hilton with her script and writers helped mccain with his script why is it that hilton seems to have a better grasp on policy details than mccain does shouldnt that be you know the other way around and third why is it that a 27 year old heiress reality show star can read a teleprompter better than the presumptive republican presidential nominee
2261651 as long as you arent buying a three dollar bottle of pink stuff i dont think it matters its a gift after all and its the thought that counts what about some sparkling wine thats always nice for a celebration
2261652 thats why were here somebodys got to win it and it might as well be us this is much like last weekend last weekend was a great opportunity for me to drive for dale earnhardt jr and mr rick hendrick and godaddy com this week to be back with dei again dan stillman the crew chief we had a good test at road atlanta and we feel pretty confident weve got a decent car youre always rolling the dice and we saw that the stars got aligned for us last weekend see if we can do it two weeks in a row
2261653 personally its just satisfying this is a new race and even tougher competition more difficult circumstances its going to be tough for sure youre only as good as your last race anyway
2261654 watkins glen kind of is similar to mosport thats the track i kind of grew up learning how to race on long fast corners slowing weve had some success here so i really enjoy coming to this place as a fan theres a ton of history here you got to like that
2261655 i think we get several thousand canadians with patrick carpentier here i think i saw jacques villeneuve on the list too well be a strong canadian contingent or we better be
2261656 thats one of the great things about this track is ive been able to come from the back here as have others turn one is the classic out braking into turn one get a good exit off of eleven and the end of the bus stop the inner loop you get a good run up through the esses you can carry a bit of momentum into the brake zone and do it there those are the two most obvious
2261657 what you try to do is in a short amount of time tell the guys what you need the car to do for you and thats what well focus on in what little practice time we have get some good information
2261658 i went around this morning with aric almirola and last week went around with brad keselowski and talked to landon cassill a fair amount im more than happy to help especially if its in your own team
2261659 its just too risky on an oval its already difficult enough trying to keep cars off the walls in the dry and in the wet it would just be that much more difficult and treacherous to be honest plus its not part of the heritage of stock car racing where they run in the rain road racing is and hopefully eventually sprint cup will do road races in the rain
2261660 i think they did a great job running that race i told them a little bit afterwards that part of the difficulty at circuit gilles villeneuve is its a very flat track surface which is a bit unusual for a road course more like a temporary street course where any amount of rain just creates a lot of flooding at one point they had the jet dryers trying to blow off all the standing water standing water is really really treacherous and it just didnt drain very well which was part of the problem
2261661 you always want to have choices i think as long as theyre the same for everybody the next phase is allowing the drivers and the teams to work on their own personal strategy when you come in to get rain tires when you go back to slicks or vice versa
2261662 its really not a fair comparison obviously good practice and the last couple of years with the corvette up in le mans we had some wet weather the corvette just has way more down force and a much bigger tire and there we also have about three choices of michelins to use for the wet for this series you only really need one also for goodyear that particular rain tire design is the one that is very similar designed to the one that we had in 2001 where was almost an entire rain race at le mans that we got our first corvette class win so its a very good designed rain tire obviously you want to have it as soft as possible for the wet and well see what the future holds
2261663 it was already a done deal obviously i would have liked to have run but im perfectly happy to focus on the 01 car here in cup
2261664 there was a pre organized deal for dale jr to run and i made a shameless attempt to ask him on tv to let me drive but im sure he wants to get a little more practice although he doesnt really need it he won here in 99 in the old busch series and the reason i know that is im the guy that finished second hell be just fine and well go hang out over there to see if we can help a little bit im happy to focus on the sprint cup deal
2261665 yeah it was very cool when nascar first said they were going to go and run a race in canada and then talked a little bit about where it was going to be for it to be there all i thought to myself was man i hope im around long enough for when they go race there to get a win is very very special for a canadian boy where gilles villeneuve is one of his heroes its very very special indeed
2261666 if you based it on how things were at infineon we were running sixth before we got tangled up with that mess with kevin harvick jamie mcmurray and tony stewart yeah youre always anxious and curious to see if what you learned testing has worked the good news is for me i worked with dan stillman before dan and i worked together on the thirty three in the nationwide series last year with kevin harvick so there is some familiarity i think were hoping for both of us that makes the communication that much better
2261667 no sprint race i am just doing the long races because this one and infineon conflicted with lms sprint races the last two years lms guys are at road america it seemed like the right time to kind of spend a little more time over here i really enjoy the long races particularly le mans they didnt want to give that up
2261668 what i learned last year is dont speed on pit lane we blew it last year finished fourth but hall of fame here last year we had a really really good chevy and i still cant figure out how we managed to do that pit lane speed deal but it is what it is i think one of the things that youve got to focus on is getting that car to turn well and stay relatively what you end up doing is you chase one end and then the other its controlling that looseness that it had at high speed exit and hopefully we can get a hold of that and have a car that we can driver hard and comfortably all day
2261669 i think the other 42 guys in here dont care personally obviously its very satisfying very gratifying to win particularly there on circuit gilles villeneuve and also to be driving for dale jr and rick hendrick that was a very very special day and i was just happy to be there and to get an opportunity to be in contention to win the race was very special

2261683 we are in a free market and consumers should be able to buy or not buy or go around and check for better prices
2261684 ive heard about this line and i think its a great idea
2261685 if you stroll down this market for instance there are courgettes for two euros 2 5 euros and 1 5 euros you never know which ones to choose
2261686 i do my shopping pretty quickly but i do try and check prices when i can but i trust this stall holder so i wouldnt really need it here
2261687 if you are in a supermarket and theres a price for tomatoes and thats the only piece of information you have youve got no idea whether you should be protesting by not buying it

2261689 what weve invented is a way to induce charges on the wall using a power supply located on the robot
2261690 the robot carries with it positive and negative charges and when the walls sees these charges it automatically generates the opposite charge the robot can then clamp onto those charges
2261691 in some ways it is similar to rubbing a balloon and sticking it on the wall except we carry our own power supply and are able to control the adhesion
2261692 it is very similar to how a toy tank works with the two treads
2261693 there are positive and negative traces attached to the treads
2261694 we simply drive it moving it like a conveyer belt

2261729 whether companies are developing solar wind advanced biofuels or any of a number of emerging clean energy technologies the combination of global economics investor interest and a forthcoming pro green turn by uncle sam makes it hard to argue a long run bear case against green stocks of course that sort of superoptimism is itself a prerequisite for a bubble
2261730 rather than one megabubble a more likely scenario is that a bunch of minibubbles in various subsectors would constantly percolate bubble and pop thats certainly been the pattern so far

2261734 were still in the very very early stages of the game is there a bubble there isnt if valuations in some publicly traded sectors are out of whack i think its a function of the fact there are too few opportunities for investors and theres too much demand and appetite for exposure to these technologies

2261755 given the realities the fiscal realities of education right now what can we do to try to achieve that goal
2261756 if our money is going someplace different than where we say our focus is those two things have to come together
2261757 the whole thing is how can we become more systematic with what we do
2261758 probably were not real strong in that area right now i think we can become a whole lot more guided and we can become a whole lot more productive as a school district with the resources we have if we get aligned with what we do

2261769 the notion that academia is some sort of bubble is mostly bunk so far as im concerned
2261770 and if someone wants to be in an academic environment then thats her or his right as well i cant understand why anyone with anything interesting to say musically would want to sorry david but while i defend anyones right to live within academic music i cant for the life of me understand why anyone with an ounce of innovation would really want to be there except for maybe the performance opportunities

2261778 ill probably have to do it myself but i want to see all forms of bullying illegal
2261779 we have harassment through telephone in the criminal code we have harassing people by letters we say the criminal code is silent on new technology
2261780 the laws in the criminal code were all written years ago lets update it where its necessary
2261781 id be very careful about making online bullying a crime
2261782 the most severe forms of cyberbullying are already captured in the criminal code
2261783 we do have freedom of expression in canada and that means sometimes you can say unpopular and even nasty things and there is a line thats crossed
2261784 that line is already in the criminal code and im not quite sure why we need a specific law targeting the internet
2261785 as someone who has been bullied for 11 1 2 years im not sure how you can express yourself through bullying
2261786 its something that should have been done a long time ago
2261787 if you can get charged for bullying physically you should be able to get charged in regards to the form of cyberbullying

2261790 well who or what can we use as a substitute
2261791 we spent so much on ads on promotions we cant just fill it in with some kind of symposium we have to have some kind of gimmick or we might as well call the whole season a loss right now
2261792 the triple concertino we commissioned from him isnt due till the fall still if hes finished one of the movements or two maybe we can premiere it as oh i dont know a sneak preview or something
2261793 call paul anyway maybe he has something else to suggest something we could use
2261794 like what you think composers have unperformed symphonies lying around in the kitchen closet next to the tea and the sugar
2261795 call him he might have a suggestion of something or someone else we can use in a pinch
2261796 not at all i was just making some salad for dinner

2261798 we could call the piece coitus interruptus i suppose but i dont imagine your board of directors would like something with that title being billed as a work in progress for soloists and orchestra
2261799 isnt there a piece youve got somewhere that we could advertise as a world premiere
2261800 its not a tone poem it was a piece he wrote when he was a young man for narrator and piano mostly narrator
2261801 somewhere in the basement ive kept part of my thesis project it was an orchestration of the piano part of arden the original work was always a bit oddly shaped enoch ardens got a half hour of narrator but only twenty minutes of music thats pretty unwieldy and i cant vouch for the quality of my contribution to it after all i wrote it forty years ago perhaps thats why ive never peddled the thing to anyone but youre free to use it if you want you do need a good actor for the role though since theres only twenty minutes of music

2261813 when we succeed in becoming so absorbed in something that our mind becomes completely one with it we are in a state of samadhi
2261814 describe how to determine the height of a skyscraper with a barometer
2261815 you tie a long piece of string to the neck of the barometer then lower the barometer from the roof of the skyscraper to the ground the length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building
2261816 firstly you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper drop it over the edge and measure the time it takes to reach the ground the height of the building can then be worked out from the formula h 0 5g x t squared but bad luck on the barometer
2261817 or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow then you measure the length of the skyscrapers shadow and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper
2261818 but if you wanted to be highly scientific about it you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper the height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force t 2 pi sqroot l g
2261819 or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths then add them up
2261820 if you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it of course you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building
2261821 but since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitors door and say to him if you would like a nice new barometer i will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper
2261822 i will remind you and everybody else that the bottom line is we cant spend it if we dont have it

2261825 in america alas beauty has become something you drive to and nature an either or proposition either you ruthlessly subjugate it or you deify it treat it as something holy and remote a thing apart as along the appalachian trail seldom would it occur to anyone on either side that people and nature could coexist to their mutual benefit that say a more graceful bridge across the delaware river might actually set off the grandeur around it
2261826 we are at a fairly early stage of this but there are areas of the iranian economy that are vulnerable to targeted sanctions whether they be in the lng liquefied natural gas sector investment in the oil and gas sector imported refined products reinsurance other financial areas which are areas we would look at if we are looking to increase the pressure on the iranian leadership
2261827 a number of other countries that we would want to involve in those discussions as we go forward
2261828 no illusions that it will be difficult as it was last time to actually agree the text of some tough sanctions in the security council
2261829 we have said we will continue looking to see how best to apply pressure to the iranian regime and we will continue to do that
2261830 we have done it in the past we will continue to do that now

2261846 in the late sixties they pioneered the country rock sound they were never really a commercial success but they were one of the most influential bands of the rock era blending hillbilly soul and raucous rock they paved the way for artists like the eagles garth brooks dwight yoakam and others founding members chris hillman and gram hillman called it cosmic american music the melding of acoustic instrumentation interrupted by searing electric guitar riffs was certainly a sound new to the music scene although the gram and hillman managed to stay together for only 3 years and 3 albums their music would far outlast their shortened career
2261847 arent you emotional now worked up about other people thinking you get emotional too easily
2261848 even if you arent emotional most women are you know thats how women are made to be in touch with their feelings they cant help themselves its ok its necessary its hardwired into you all just like it is hardwired into us to be the providers so men will treat you the same way theyve noticed other women behave i guess its difficult because you think you are different but you arent really you cant see it like the way i do to me you are emotional
2261849 when it comes down to it emotion never held us back so we may have cried a little probably in anger or helplessness and it was release like kicking the shit out of a punching bag but without having your muscles ache the next morning and we picked ourselves up after that and did what we had to it never stopped us we still went to school went to work took care of the kids cooked cleaned and did bloody good jobs of it too so why this fear of emotion why this harsh accusatory tone why the scorn and contempt why the presumption that it holds us back and if we lapse like im sure you do why is it so imperative that we need to be utterly objective and rational 24x7 to have to prove this to you why should we be forced to prove anything in the first place is it the price we pay to be on equal footing to just simply have the luxury of not being dismissed what is so terribly wrong with acknowledging ones emotions anyway do you see it as a sign of weakness on the contrary my friend it takes courage to face up to things deal with it and move on would you prefer instead that we shy away or just bottle it all up for when we are old and bitter and grey how is that so hard to see that being capable of expressing emotion and being emotional are two different things and if at worst you cant understand this why cant we just be different emotionally without it affecting other spheres of our interaction as long as we can be logical and reasonable at all the times that matter

2261954 heres the explanation obama gave saturday in london when asked about the cancelled visit to the landstuhl regional medical center q can you clear up the controversy about visiting the troops in germany the pentagon said you were more welcome to come but you cant bring the media and were not allowed to bring campaign staff other than that you are more than welcome anytime inaudible we have gotten a few conflicting claims obama the staff was working this so i dont know each and every detail but here is what i understand happened we had scheduled to go we had no problem at all in leaving we always leave press and staff off that is why we left it off the schedule we were treating it in the same way we treat a visit to walter reed which i was able to do a few weeks ago without any fanfare whatsoever i was going to be accompanied by one of my advisors former military officer and we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasnt on the senate staff that triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political and the last thing that i want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns so rather than go forward and potentially get caught up in what might have been considered a political controversy of some sort what we decided was that we not make a visit and instead i would call some of the troops that were that so that essentially would be the extent of the story

2262078 we expected 500 bookings and have received 300 till now but we are still receiving inquiries
2262079 there were some inquiries from companies but it stayed at that we did not get into selling olympic tickets our experience has shown that indians usually skip watching the olympics

2262211 during the interview adkisson stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of major media outlets adkisson made statements that because he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them into office adkisson stated that he had held these beliefs for about the last ten years
2262212 equating islam with other religions is a betrayal of islam
2262213 while i suggest that the distinguished imam is wrong in believing that the quran is the word of god and in fact follows a false prophet peace be upon him and will burn in hell for all eternity im sure we can still find enough common ground to apply for a generous faith based grant once senator obama is elected president
2262214 but of course cannot have a potter without a pot either
2262215 one of the oldest accusations against god in the bible and in every generation since has been that there is too much evil in this world for there to be a good god of course ceasing to be a jew or a christian does not wipe these evils away the rejection of god does not diminish evil in the world by a whit
2262216 in fact the turn of russia and germany from more or less christian regimes to boastfully atheist regimes did not lessen but increased the number of humans who have horribly suffered by nearly 100 million
2262217 i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator by defending myself against the jew i am fighting for the work of the lord
2262218 even under atheistic interpretations of science the vast suffering under ferocious competition for survival for a vastly longer era than was known far exceeds the evils earlier generations knew
2262219 t hose who suffer most from injustice and oppression seem to find more consolation and dignity in the jewish christian faith than in any other worldview
2262220 judaism and christianity seem very good religions for those who suffer because they bestow on them justice and dignity the realistic point of judaism and christianity is that suffering is a normal part of every human life
2262221 in fact the poor also delight in the beauties of gods creation on balance even with their acute suffering the poor also feel blessed they sense the rapture of sunlight flashing across lake or ocean and soft breezes at sunset and the great starry sky
2262222 for christianity the interpretive key to this world is the cross the cross on which the son of god died for judaism it is the long long exile and pain of the jewish people if god has so treated his only son and also his own people why should anyone else expect easy street
2262223 worse the world seen by evolutionary biology alone is even more rife with suffering yet rather more merciless that world is characterized by raw chance accident and the death of about 90 of all species that have ever lived perhaps earthquakes tsunami tornado disease and famine derive from chance and signify nothing

2262239 the american withdrawal from vietnam is widely remembered as an ignominious end to a misguided war but one with few negative repercussions for the united states and its allies
2262240 it is undoubtedly true that americas failure in vietnam led to catastrophic consequences in the region especially in cambodia
2262241 but there are a couple of further points that need weighing
2262242 one is that the khmer rouge would never have come to power in the absence of the war in vietnam this dark force arose out of the circumstances of the war was in a deep sense created by the war the same thing has happened in the middle east today foreign occupation of iraq has created far more terrorists than it has deterred

2262258 arizona sen john mccain is sponsoring two interesting pieces of legislation one mounts a direct assault on congressional earmarks those little morsels of home district pork that lawmakers slip into unrelated spending bills the other steers 10 million to the university of arizona to launch an academic center honoring the late supreme court chief justice william rehnquist yes mccain does seem to be saying to himself stop me before i sin again mccain and co sponsor jon kyl arizonas other gop senator insist their pork proposal isnt hypocritical because they arent trying to hide anything it is set out in stand alone legislation to be vetted on its own merits in congress it seems the only bad pork projects are those sponsored by somebody else
2262259 after years of crusading against pork barrel spending projects in congressional appropriations bills senator mccain may be breaking his own rules mccain pushed for and got 14 3 million for arizonas luke air force base inserted into the just completed fiscal 2004 military construction appropriations conference report the only problem is the project to acquire more land near the base was not requested

2262267 i wonder how much revelatory poetry was revealed by drugs
2262268 well kubla khan was inspired by an opium induced dream then coleridge was interrupted by a knock theres an interesting story about that a time traveler wanted to find out who interrupted coleridge turns out that person was him
2262269 besides lots of revelatory fires were caused by burning bunches of marijuana at the temple at delphi they built a bonfire inside and threw on marijuana plants then they danced around the smoke and fire to induce visions and aldous huxley said theres literally no difference between tripping and schizophrenia just that schizos were stuck couldnt come back and some time in the past twenty years scientists have found a god circuit in the brain some people have it some dont some are hard wired for believing in god i talk a lot with you
2262270 you dont have barriers you only have doors i feel in our writings that were making tracks making traction in the intellectual creative world

2262296 i have thought of myself as a feminist first but my ethnicity cannot be separated from my feminism
2262297 i find myself as i get older assuming a more political stance in my writings i have moved from writing intensely personal poetry to writing essays on social and political issues the reason for this progression in my writings is that my identity as an asian american and my identity as a woman is just beginning to merge within me as a singular identity and i am feeling a missionary zeal to let others know about it

2262377 whether it falls in the chase or not i dont know if it is that important but i think its definitely important and i think the history of this sport and you look at how many years that they have not only been at the glen but at sonoma i think road course racing is important in this series and i think its nice to break up the every week routine that we have and throw in and have two races like this that add a different discipline to what we do and showcase the drivers talents and the crews talents in a different way

2262461 these agreements which bring the fight against illegal immigration and development under the same framework have allowed france and a few other oecd members to use aid to put pressure on developing countries when negotiating tough readmission agreements generalising this negotiation tactic at european level could be very damaging for developing countries
2262462 linking development policies and migration presents clear risks of undermining the focus on the eradication of poverty and inequalities in the poorest countries europe cannot tie the allocation of aid to developing countries to progress on legal or illegal migration and readmission whilst european member states may sign agreements on migration with third countries these should not become conditions for development cooperation

2262464 african politics are highly personalized trust in institutions is exceptional but the eu africa partnership requires effective or at least working administrative structures which are inexistent in many states
2262465 the eu africa partnership offers the opportunity to reduce asymmetries between europe and africa even while trade and development cooperation remains stuck in traditional patterns a definition of the partnership beyond symbolism and without the patina of development would in itself be a success for both the eu and africa
2262466 much of what europe would like to see in africa will only come when nature or constructive societal evolution has phased out the current breed of africas leaders who are more interested in self preservation and their ego than in the service to their country and subservience to the social cause

2262480 the limited due diligence that was conducted appears to have been constrained by the need not to offend the client
2262481 the real conflict lies not in the actual receipt of high fees but in their expected receipt
2262482 if left to their own devices and subjected to a significant threat of private litigation professionals will respond by defining gaap and auditing standards in their own interest rather than that of investors
2262483 absent a litigation threat professionals acquiesce in dubious and risky practices that their client wants but once subjected to an adequate litigation threat professionals insist upon narrow duties hopelessly specific safe harbors and a rule base system that often seems devoid of meaningful principles
2262484 the challenge for the regulator is not to take discretion out of the system but to preserve and expand it but discretion must be accorded to the gatekeeper not the client whereas present day gaap does the reverse

2262487 its only material if it affects his ability to carry out his responsibilities up to that point its up to him

2262494 the court grants injunctive relief to prevent a vote from taking place where there is a credible threat that shareholders will be asked to vote without such complete and accurate information the corollary to this point however is that once this irreparable harm has occurred i e when shareholders have voted without complete and accurate information it is by definition too late to remedy the harm
2262495 i hold that this court cannot grant monetary or injunctive relief for disclosure violations in connection with a proxy solicitation in favor of a merger three years after that merger has been consummated and where there is no evidence of a breach of the duty of loyalty or good faith by the directors who authorized the disclosures
2262496 consistent with rather than at odds with his fiduciary duties

2262529 this was one of the more straightforward assessments for a potential addition to category a in the last few years not least due to the very high standard of the submission documentation that included good quality images identification of a juvenile great blue heron was easily established there was no evidence to suggest the bird had benefited from assisted passage or any evidence of possible escape risk in europe equally the age of the bird the date weather and locality were convincing for genuine vagrancy without biometrics a definitive statement on racial identity was impossible though the committee recognised that nominate herodias is the most likely on the basis of distribution and migratory behaviour following a speedy electronic circulation great blue heron was unanimously accepted to category a
2262530 the identification of great blue heron in a vagrant context has been well covered birding world 11 12 20 the occurrence of this species in the uk has long been anticipated but it is still a considerable credit to the birds finder that he had an active search image for this species and was able to confirm the identification and spread the news very quickly despite being a one day occurrence the finder also submitted excellent documentation in support of the claim which made the assessment of the identification straightforward for bbrc

2262536 for mccain to win in such troubled times he needs to begin telling the american people how he intends to lead us that mccain exists he can inspire the country to greatness
2262537 there is legitimate mockery of a political campaign now and it isnt at obamas for mccains sake this tomfoolery needs to stop

2262615 van a ser un periplo que terminar de desarrollar varios proyectos entre estos pa ses hermanos
2262616 una creciente percepci n internacional de que el presidente venezolano hugo ch vez ha llegado al l mite de su influencia internacional al punto que est buscando un acercamiento a estados unidos
2262617 le hemos dicho a venezuela que desear amos explorar esta apertura diplom tica afirm el subsecretario de estado thomas a shannon
2262618 la cooperaci n en la lucha contra las drogas ser a un terreno familiar para ambos gobiernos y ser a bien vista en la regi n
2262619 no se hac a muchas ilusiones sobre un mejoramiento de las relaciones ya que
2262620 un pol tico ambicioso no se pod a decir tampoco que ha abandonado su aspiraci n de ser presidente vitalicio
2262621 pero no tiene actualmente un mecanismo constitucional que lo respalde en ese prop sito
2262622 conducta err tica de ch vez ha sido causa de preocupaci n en la regi n donde los pa ses
2262623 muchas razones para ello y mencion entre ellas el resurgimiento de l deres regionales tradicionales que han
2262624 se han visto empantanados en sus propias dificultades internas e incapacidad de ayudar y se han difundido informes sobre una
2262625 estos factores han contribuido a una creciente percepci n internacional de que venezuela ha llegado a los l mites de su influencia internacional dijo shannon
2262626 shannon viene a opinar contradictoriamente porque expresa la contradicci n de c mo anda la sociedad norteamericana rechazamos las expresiones que hace shannon de nuestro pa s
2262627 est n dispuestos a sentarse en una mesa a conversar de igual a igual conversaremos todo lo que haya que conversar sin hipocres as sin contradicciones con franqueza y transparencia
2262628 las exportaciones del pa s acumuladas en diez a os alcanzar a los 4 000 millones de d lares sin mayor esfuerzos y con un vasto efecto multiplicador
2262629 la oportunidad de prepararse para enfrentar una demanda externa creciente y garantizada en mercados con alto poder adquisitivo
2262630 una pol tica de estado clara que beneficie a todos los bolivianos d ndose mayor bienestar
2262631 el mundo debe mirarnos como proveedores de energ a a trav s del gas y de los biocombustibles
2262632 la intenci n del evento no era polemizar ideologizar ni politizar el tema sino dialogar buscando un beneficio colectivo para los bolivianos buscando conjugar la exportaci n de energ a tradicional f sil con las nuevas exportaciones en bioenerg a de origen vegetal a partir de recursos renovables en el marco de las exportaciones no hablaremos de sustituci n de importaci n de diesel
2262633 agresi n al medio ambiente sino por el contrario recuperando tierras ya impactadas con los cultivos alternativos como el caso del pi n que exige suelos ridos
2262634 con una enorme oportunidad para un pa s empobrecido como bolivia
2262635 de ese monto acumulado el incremento neto de las ventas ser a de 3 000 millones de d lares con un vasto efecto multiplicador entre 200 000 y 300 000 empleos en el pa s bolivia debe aprovechar las oportunidades
2262636 el banderazo de salida por parte de las autoridades gubernamentales
2262637 la impunidad de estos cr menes de lesa humanidad no s lo es ausencia de sanci n sino que los no sancionados desde donde est n conducen los hilos del pensamiento pol tico en el pa s pueden estar mimetizados en un comit c vico
2262638 ya no es tiempo de juzgar sino de recuperar el cad ver
2262639 me encuentro mortificada por este informe que confirma mi denuncia formulada hace varios meses no es posible que se haya permitido que la cuenca del r o suches se haya contaminado con par metros superiores a los permitidos por las normas nacionales e internacionales puesto que dicha cuenca provee de agua a poblaciones de forma directa que es utilizada tanto para el uso personal como en la agricultura y ganader a
2262640 no puede ser que se tenga que hacer varias denuncias para que se atiendan los problemas sociales como sta por la que exigimos que el poder ejecutivo tome acciones del caso
2262641 ser a remar contra la corriente insistir en lo contrario insistir en que no ha pasado nada y que podemos seguir avanzando hacia el mercado com n eso ser a remar contra la corriente
2262642 creo que la can tiene que asumir una agenda que privilegie la integraci n f sica que privilegie temas de integraci n fronteriza y desarrollo social pero que asuma que no est n las condiciones dadas para formar el mercado com n para el cual fue prevista
2262643 no queremos excluir a nadie lo que no queremos es ser rehenes de quienes no quieren el acuerdo no estamos en contra de nadie estamos a favor de tener un acuerdo
2262644 no hay ning n tema de conflicto hay percepciones distintas proyectos de desarrollo diferentes pero no contenciosos bilaterales
2262645 luego podemos encontrar lo mismo por la v a de acuerdos bilaterales
2262646 ser a como tirar una moneda al aire pues ahora ya gozamos del sistema generalizado de preferencias sgp que es como un tlc
2262647 es un exceso de celo boliviano pretender que en la can va a imponer su visi n de las cosas bolivia solo est en contra pero no propone nada pero si no podemos convivir con nuestras diferencias o si se va a persistir en esta actitud la can no tiene viabilidad
2262648 la can ya cumpli su ciclo es verdad que un d a fue un impulso pero hoy d a es un lastre as que no le veo problemas a salir
2262649 hay que trabajar y no hablar de salir hasta no haber agotado todas las posibilidades
2262650 yo descartar a salir de la can porque podemos sacar adelante la modificaci n que necesitamos para el tlc con ee uu adem s estamos trabajando con europa para agilizar el proceso de llegar a un acuerdo de manera asim trica
2262651 no hay que hablar de salir de la can estamos trabajando con la uni n europea para manejar la negociaci n de manera mixta esto es habr temas en los que todos los pa ses estar n de acuerdo y se negociar en bloque y otro en los que algunos avancen m s r pido de que otros y entonces se negociar a los temas independientemente
2262652 pese a que no debemos patear el tablero con la can la ue ya acept llegar a un acuerdo diferenciado con el per y con colombia
2262653 la uni n europea negocia con bloques de pa ses entendemos que existen asimetr as al interior pero as es como negociamos porque son acuerdos integrales de educaci n asistencia social y que tambi n tienen un componente comercial
2262654 las negociaciones hasta setiembre para precisamente aclarar si hay voluntad pol tica de los cuatro pa ses para coronar un acuerdo
2262655 clar simo que desde un punto de vista econ mico el costo de oportunidad es favorable a la ue sobre nuestra permanencia en la can los flujos de comercio de la can son absolutamente peque os comparados con la ue las cifras son sideralmente distintas
2262656 esto es como el tango o se baila o no se baila el riesgo es que demos el salto y que no haya red
2262657 los incidentes han quedado superados y estamos m s bien abriendo un etapa constructiva y que corresponda a la importancia de la relaci n entre los dos pa ses
2262658 que satisfagan las capacidades y los puntos de vista de cada uno de los pa ses
2262659 ellos dieron a conocer su intenci n de hacer unas jornadas junto con nosotros en nuestra ciudad vinieron 21 y nos dieron un ejemplo de participaci n
2262660 es una modalidad muy novedosa moderna y motivadora para nosotros que no usamos videolaparoscop a teniendo la posibilidad esto nos ha servido para comparar qu estamos haciendo frente a una ciudad tan importante como la paz
2262661 esto es una experiencia muy linda para nosotros desde el punto de vista m dico y social pues si bien venimos con alguna frecuencia a hacer turismo los bolivianos la recepci n fue muy buena y tambi n el intercambio de conocimientos
2262662 es muy probable que este compromiso empiece a correr los primeros d as de enero de 2009 el tiempo estar sujeto a los tr mites correspondientes que se tiene que seguir con per petro y los ministerios correspondientes todos los trabajos de exploraci n formar n parte de una primera fase que tendr a una duraci n de un a o y medio
2262663 queremos una autonom a donde no haya grupos de personas que se encargue de amenazar queremos una autonom a en la que los alcaldes y prefectos trabaje para la poblaci n no queremos una autonom a como pretexto para robarse la plata y no hacer nada sino una autonom a para el desarrollo
2262664 el idh no es para guard rselo para pagar a un grupo de matones o insultar el idh es de todos los bolivianos y nosotros estamos dispuestos a defender el idh para todos los bolivianos
2262665 le pido al prefecto rub n costas que por favor no haga tanta pol tica trabaje para santa cruz haga obras construya y no haga tanta pol tica porque santa cruz se merece trabajo y desarrollo
2262666 si en quinientos a os no desaparecimos no suceder ahora
2262667 la emancipaci n de las comunidades olvidadas a trav s de los siglos y que ahora recuperan su voz y sus derechos
2262668 es dif cil pensar que un proceso as pudiera tener lugar bajo una dictadura f rrea
2262669 si ese proceso tiene lugar es porque hay un proceso democr tico como condici n previa
2262670 encontrar un punto de equilibrio entre la unidad del estado y la diversidad
2262671 el reconocimiento del otro del que habla viste piensa y tiene una visi n diferente de las cosas
2262672 vencer las distancias y acortar diferencias en la alianza de civilizaciones
2262673 haya en latinoam rica un gobierno el de bolivia presidido por un ind gena
2262674 si en quinientos a os no desaparecimos los ind genas mucho menos suceder ahora
2262675 la participaci n activa del embajador norteamericano philip goldberg en la creaci n del movimiento separatista cuyo xito depender a de un golpe de estado
2262676 la conspiraci n de la embajada norteamericana para desestabilizar al gobierno utilizando sus seis brazos usaid personal diplom tico el cuerpo de paz la dea el grupo militar y la cia
2262677 estamos en peligro nos van a desarmar y es una trampa gracias a nuestros mauser evo morales es presidente sin ellos no nos hubi semos enfrentado al ej rcito en warisata omasuyos en 2003 con esas armas hemos derrotado a gonzalo s nchez de lozada
2262678 el fantasma del golpe suave una nueva modalidad de desestabilizaci n fabricada en la cia acecha la democracia en bolivia
2262679 la oposici n sabe que no tiene el apoyo del pueblo
2262680 el presidente ha manifestado varias veces que es anticapitalista antiimperialista pero tambi n que no es antinorteamericano
2262681 queremos pleno respeto no intromisi n o sometimiento estados unidos va entendiendo que ya no somos esos gobiernos de antes que les consultaban todo nosotros consultamos a nuestro pueblo somos un pa s peque o pero digno exigimos respeto
2262682 quieren imponer sus formas de trabajo y son expulsados en algunos casos violentamente los funcionarios de la usaid han salido pac ficamente los compa eros no estaban de acuerdo en que hiciesen trabajo pol tico y se han hecho respetar de manera soberana
2262683 los que tenemos que decidir qu modelo de desarrollo y de sociedad queremos construir bienvenidas sean las instituciones que vengan y que nos ayuden a conseguir lo que nosotros hemos decidido no vamos a aceptar instituciones que vengan a obstaculizar nuestro desarrollo
2262684 desde estados unidos hablan de bolivia como un estado fallido ya est n calificando porque es lo que ellos quieren y quieren sacar a evo ahora evo convoca a referendo no quieren qu quieren derrocarlo matarlo
2262685 acusaci n por sedici n es una persecuci n pol tica
2262686 porque ser a hacernos c mplices de una violaci n a la constituci n
2262687 lo que el presidente morales ha hecho es convocar directamente con una ley especial revocatoria cuando no existe este instrumento en la legislaci n al margen de ser inconstitucional la consulta est violando principios de la democracia garantizados por convenciones internacionales
2262688 adem s la pregunta revocatoria por ley debe ser sometida a control de constitucionalidad se ha evadido ese proceso y quieren que nos presentemos con inequidad de igualdad respecto a los porcentajes con que se revocan o ratifican los cargos para revocar a morales tenemos que sacar m s de 53 pero para revocar al prefecto de la paz basta con 37 as se est estableciendo un principio de discriminaci n para evaluar a una persona de manera sesgada en relaci n a otra
2262689 una noche me comuniqu con el senador antonio peredo y algunos senadores de la paz todos del mas y dije si no hacen aprobar la ley en el senado yo me voy a someter a la huelga de hambre bajo amenazas aprobaron la ley en el senado
2262690 la paz con petr leo ser el mejor regalo de su bicentenario
2262691 ypfb antes de la capitalizaci n proceso implementado en 1996 por el gobierno de gonzalo s nchez de lozada ten a 16 equipos de perforaci n ahora no tenemos ni uno
2262692 como presidente de los bolivianos recibir al se or shannon en el palacio de gobierno para conversar sinceramente con l sobre los problemas y los actos de conspiraci n que hemos denunciado
2262693 ninguna relaci n con el desarrollo de la situaci n interna de bolivia
2262694 constituir tambi n parte del corredor bioce nico que integrar la red vial brasile a a los puertos chilenos y peruanos en el pac fico
2262695 las pr ximas acciones referentes a la unasur uni n de naciones suramericanas y lo que se refiere a la formaci n de un consejo de defensa
2262696 exponer otra vez la posici n brasile a exponer cu l es la idea brasile a respecto del asunto y esclarecer dudas que existan todav a a ese respecto
2262697 est disponible para en caso de que el gobierno colombiano lo juzgue apropiado integrar el grupo de pa ses que facilite las negociaciones con miras a facilitar la liberaci n de los dem s rehenes
2262698 la visita del presidente lula a bolivia y la formalizaci n de esos protocolos de financiamiento deben ser entendidos como una muestra del compromiso brasile o con el desarrollo econ mico y social de bolivia y en un contexto m s amplio de generaci n de nueva infraestructura en am rica del sur
2262699 vienen a hablar para evaluar la ayuda y tratar de superar los problemas
2262700 me siento tranquilo porque en espa a no va a cambiar nada es m s vamos a ayudar a regularizar a los compatriotras en situaci n irregular no estamos hablando de una regularizaci n masiva en las conversaciones generales que tuvimos con el canciller estamos viendo que se va a hacer una regularizaci n caso por caso pero no va a haber eso de la expulsi n
2262701 y como estamos haciendo en espa a vamos a dialogar con otros pa ses donde tenemos compatriotas bolivianos
2262702 luego de que nuestro embajador en dicha naci n fernando rojas retornara a su sede diplom tica hace dos d as
2262703 empec a decirles que estaban tirando las cosas y que mejor las guardaran y nosotros las llevar amos a honduras o a bolivia
2262704 en esas escuelas de all no tienen nada de esos materiales
2262705 cuando fuimos nos llevamos los tiles y distribuimos marcadores fue interesante ver c mo se emocionaron los ni os por un marcador nosotros damos por hecho que tenemos esas cosas
2262706 art culos peque os como estos tienen un impacto negativo al llegar al basurero
2262707 realmente estamos aplicando la regla de reutilizar reducir y reciclar
2262708 enarsa encontr m s petr leo del que hay en toda la argentina
2262709 el consumo de gas ha crecido mucho en la regi n y hoy por hoy la regi n tiene un d ficit muy importante
2262710 es el principio de una buena noticia que va a ir generando expectativa
2262711 desarrollar la ingenier a geol gica y de petr leo para ver c mo va a explotar esos yacimientos
2262712 en el proceso siguiente pantera debe captar los recursos para poder enfrentar todas las inversiones que debe hacer recientemente el congreso aprob varios contratos de empresas que se asociaron con la firma que anunci esta noticia
2262713 dos semanas atr s me entrevist en asunci n con ejecutivos de la compa a pantera que llegaron para intentar asociarse con empresas paraguayas que quisieran buscar crudo
2262714 pantera tiene una concesi n pero no est realizando ninguna perforaci n
2262715 no es gran cosa podr a agotarse en un mes
2262716 estamos asociadas a pantera pero en paraguay no se puede decir que haya petr leo porque no fue encontrado a n
2262717 pero en d cadas pasadas se hicieron exploraciones y existen indicios de crudo nuestra zona para la b squeda est en las cercan as del hito 7 en la frontera noroeste con bolivia necesitamos dinero para continuar las investigaciones por un a o cada pozo tiene un costo de 5 millones de d lares
2262718 encontraron gas pero sin posibilidades a n de una explotaci n comercial
2262719 los trabajos se cumplieron ntegramente hace una semana se levantaron los campamentos pero no conocemos los resultados
2262720 hugo ch vez no hace lo suficiente para combatir el narcotr fico
2262721 se hayan llevado a peruanos hacia el extranjero para ser sometidos a estos tratamientos
2262722 what are you waiting for step forward into the river you are my leader dont stop here
2262723 your knee your knee is a hundred times over my head
2262724 well maybe you shouldnt be leading a camel stay with those like yourself a mouse has nothing really to say to a camel
2262725 get up on my hump i am made to take hundreds like you across
2262726 and he also had dealings with omar shaykh the man who murdered osama bin laden
2262727 i am drunk and unaware of one or a thousand
2262728 halal mix tape even tackles current issues like innovations in the deen
2262729 companies are continuing to invest in technology to reduce costs and enhance their information technology infrastructures
2262730 un golpe militar un golpe de estado un golpe a la democracia
2262731 no se puede poner en la balanza lo que gana bolivia en su relaci n con ee uu con lo que podr a llegar a ganar con ir n
2262732 los mercados responden por ejemplo a los comportamientos de consumo de sus ciudadanos y es muy dif cil que el consumo iran cambie en el corto plazo
2262733 cabe cuestionarse si los bolivianos est n dispuestos a sumarse a esta cruzada que puede sacar al pa s del mbito natural al que siempre ha pertenecido para introducirlo en otro totalmente opuesto a sus valores y principios tradicionales
2262734 no hay nada oficial y creo que tampoco extraoficial en la inversi n iran en hidrocarburos se apunta a que petrobras apoye al sector
2262735 ir n y venezuela han prometido muchas cosas pero no hay control ni transparencia en lo que dicen todo es un misterio a qu costo recibimos esta ayuda
2262736 hay bastante conflicto y una fuerte polarizaci n de cara al referendum
2262737 creciente conflictividad producto de la convocatoria de este referendum que ha recibido fuertes resistencias y con la posibilidad de que genere violencia
2262738 s podr an perder el poder algunos prefectos pero todo depender del grado de participaci n ciudadana
2262739 refer ndum es de alt simo poder explosivo y por lo tanto destructor de la nacionalidad
2262740 un proyecto de poder en torno a un tipo de cogobierno de naciones y pueblos
2262741 yo siento que si pasar a algo con evo morales siento que puede haber una rebeli n y a eso le tengo miedo
2262742 tal vez me puedan tumbar a m pero no van a tumbar al pueblo boliviano
2262743 territorio libre de analfabetismo y territorio libre de usaid agencia de estados unidos para el desarrollo internacional por tanto del imperialismo norteamericano
2262744 el presidente morales ha recibido un mandato como nunca como ning n presidente ha tenido un apoyo del 54 por ciento y est llevando adelante ese mandato que ha recibido del pueblo boliviano estamos en tiempo de grandes transformaciones
2262745 hay en bolivia grupos de poder que sin trabajar son due os de grandes empresas de medios de comunicaci n de grandes extensiones de tierra que no aceptan este proceso de cambio
2262746 esta reacci n que tienen ellos los potentados porque nosotros vamos afectar estos intereses de unos cuantos
2262747 acudir el pr ximo 10 de agosto y aceptar la voluntad del soberano
2262748 son las mismas familias la misma oligarqu a de antes que temen perder sus privilegios
2262749 enemigos de la democracia y de responder a una estructura neoliberal
2262750 no existe argumento jur dico constitucional tico o hist rico para suspender la consulta popular
2262751 pertinente que este proceso se pueda suspender ya que la ley para la consulta que ha sido promulgada tiene muchas falencias fallas
2262752 este lunes por hoy nosotros vamos a respaldar que se pare el refer ndum para que se d tiempo a la cne de encontrar los recursos legales correspondientes
2262753 la suspensi n del refer ndum revocatorio hasta que el tribunal constitucional legalmente conformado se pronuncie sobre la constitucionalidad
2262754 que la cooperaci n sea transparente directa r pida que el dinero de los ciudadanos estadounidenses no llegue a la oposici n y que se financie a la gente que m s necesite
2262755 terminamos acordando que la nica conspiraci n que va a existir en nuestras relaciones bilaterales ser la conspiraci n contra la pobreza contra la desigualdad y contra la exclusi n social
2262756 esto lo certifican los resultados de los an lisis del laboratorio que pertenece a la provincia de chaco
2262757 en todo el norte provincial hay rabia transmitida por los murci lagos vampiros por ello continuamos con la vigilancia y atentos
2262758 protegi a nuestros padres y abuelos en los a o 70 80 perseguidos por gobiernos militares violentos o de gobiernos civiles ileg timos que en nuestro pa s a su turno gobernaron
2262759 este tipo de actividades fuera de nuestro lugar de origen sostiene nos hace sentir a todos m s seguros y orgullosos de ser bolivianos estamos fortaleciendo tambi n con nuestra presencia la solidaridad internacional con nuestro pueblo encarrilado hoy en un din mico proceso de cambios liderado por el presidente evo morales
2262760 para demostrar la riqueza de nuestra cultura e incentivar en nuestros hijos a custodiar junto a sus sue os y objetivos esta nica y original manifestaci n nacional cuya consigna es la integraci n
2262761 los bolivianos que conformamos la red pro bolivia estamos al lado del pueblo s a la continuaci n del presidente evo morales ayma y alvaro garc a linera s a la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado no a los prefectos racistas y fascistas no a los delincuentes de la uni n juvenil cruce ista
2262762 se me ha violado el derecho constitucional a la defensa a un debido proceso a ser considerado inocente hasta que se demuestre lo contrario en fin todo lo que usted y su grupo de camaradas o compa eros no tuvieron que pasar seg n entendemos todos por los relatos de aquellos que vivieron de cerca y fueron protagonistas de la situaci n de su encarcelamiento
2262763 nueve meses de encarcelamiento dos huelgas de hambre para intentar ser escuchado varias amenazas de ser traslado a un penal para ser asesinado una agresi n f sica y varias psicol gicas en fin lo normal en un sistema de gobierno autoritario y dictatorial como el que vive desgraciadamente nuestro pa s y que se hace llamar democr tico donde el poder judicial recibe y acata ordenes de otros poderes donde la mayor a de los jueces por el temor de perder su cargo no toman decisiones ajustadas a la ley y admiten acusaciones arbitrarias como la realizada en mi contra un pa s donde el ciudadano com n tiene miedo de ser perseguido y encarcelado por exigir que se respeten sus derechos
2262764 the only way to balance the market is by choking off demand which would require a spike above 200
2262765 oil has been very cheap now its becoming rather expensive
2262766 everyone expected a normal market response to higher prices would be an expansion of production but that hasnt happened
2262767 this widely distributed message is so full of misinformation that we find
2262768 i told you so i knew obama was this or that and a dirty whatchamacallit i just knew it to be true
2262769 could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2262770 and all that other stuff i made up last week is true too
2262771 hey i only made him fall on a play sword
2262772 if you kill one person you get death if you kill a group of people due to a white collar crime you get a pathetic little fine if you kill millions you get a national holiday
2262773 if you talk to the animals they will talk with you and you will know each other if you do not talk to them you will not know them and what you do not know you will fear what one fears one destroys
2262774 los discordes en concordia en paz y amor se juntaron y pueblo de paz fundaron para perpetua memoria
2262775 el per y chile necesitan de una pol tica com n respecto a bolivia
2262776 estaba un poco preocupado con am rica latina pero est tomando la direcci n correcta y creo que la gente deber a mantener un ojo en bolivia
2262777 en general la regi n est mucho m s estable y existe m s cooperaci n
2262778 en mi mandato en la onu intentamos estimular a washington a conversar con ch vez personalmente estimul a hugo a hablar con washington pero eso no ocurri
2262779 reflejan la situaci n pol tica de la segunda guerra mundial y no tienen en cuenta la importancia de los pa ses emergentes
2262780 esas son potencias importantes que tienen que ser tenidas en cuenta para resolver las cuestiones globales
2262781 vamos a enviar una peque a misi n que en coordinaci n con la embajada de bolivia en m xico y con la propia canciller a mexicana estar muy pendiente del referendo revocatorio ya que consideramos que es un evento importante debido a la situaci n compleja que se vive en bolivia
2262782 es importante que este proceso se lleve a cabo de la mejor manera pues de no atenderse se puede generar un verdadero conflicto en bolivia
2262783 responde a un gesto de entendimiento y un reconocimiento como parte de los gobiernos progresistas que le han ganado a los neoliberalistas
2262784 me parece bien que finalmente entierre el hacha de la intromisi n o del ataque lo que es inaceptable para nosotros y para am rica latina
2262785 quieren seguir deforestando y enga an a la gente la asustan la aterrorizan pagan campa as para seguir intimidando a la poblaci n es un sector insano y explotador al que hay que enfrentarlo pol ticamente y sin ning n temor
2262786 a m me parece criminal y deplorable a esa gente hay que ponerla al descubierto y denunciarla porque trafica con la miseria de los seres humanos entonces todos estos temas hay que abordarlos con serenidad
2262787 a ellos los respetamos comprendemos y les pedimos disculpas por no hacer las cosas m s r pidamente hay cosas que hemos debido hacer m s r pido y no lo hemos hecho entonces hay que rectificar sanamente cambiar escuchar la voz de la mayor a
2262788 todo tiene que ser programado de acuerdo con la disponibilidad de los recursos p blicos hay por otro lado muy mala informaci n hay tambi n trabas burocr ticas que impiden que se gasten con mayor celeridad los recursos p blicos y esa es una gran tarea que tendr que emprender el nuevo ministro de econom a
2262789 hay gente malvada que no se alegra de una inversi n sino que la maldicen porque ven que se reduce su espacio de acci n pol tica hay otros que quieren que clonemos modelos extranjeros como el de cuba de venezuela nicaragua o bolivia que respetamos pero no compartimos pues son modelos completamente diferentes
2262790 yo ya termin lo dem s tendr que ser programado en agosto le corresponde a la pr xima junta directiva definir los temas ya estamos a pocos d as de las elecciones
2262791 no vamos a permitir m s que una persona o un prefecto est oponi ndose al cumplimiento de una ley de la rep blica
2262792 es una acci n hostil que el c digo penal califica como sedici n
2262793 le solicitamos deje de hacer campa a confundiendo a la poblaci n pretendiendo que cometamos el mismo error que cometi el pueblo venezolano cuando decidi no asistir a los comicios electorales por los mismos argumentos que usted est vertiendo
2262794 hemos cursado invitaciones a pilotos de chile per y la argentina porque queremos que la competencia tenga car cter internacional
2262795 tenemos que analizar la situaci n y ver si se vuelven a repetir las hidrolog as m s secas de la serie y qu es lo que ocurre con eventuales fallas en centrales
2262796 no es ninguna sorpresa sabemos que desde hace algunas semanas la forma en que argentina est importando el gas es a trav s de regasificaci n de gnl con los barcos de bah a blanca
2262797 tal como se comprometieron las autoridades argentinas en niveles suficientes para satisfacer nuestros requerimientos comerciales y residenciales
2262798 lo que se al a comienzos de a o la argentina fue no solamente su compromiso de enviar los niveles de gas requeridos para que no haya problemas en el suministro rescom de consumidores residenciales y comerciales sino que tambi n se al que el c lculo de la retenci n iba a basarse en el costo al cual ellos est n importando gas sabemos que hace algunas semanas la forma en la cual est importando gas la argentina es a trav s de la regasificaci n de gnl en bah a blanca y que los costos de esa operaci n son bastante m s altos que los asociados a las importaciones de gas desde bolivia as que esto no es una sorpresa
2262799 se sienten a hablar sabiendo que son iguales y que no hay ning n derecho preferencial de unos sobre otros
2262800 a poder hacer cada d a una cooperaci n que sea sentida por ambas partes como algo que realmente mejora al conjunto
2262801 no se trata de ver en qu manera se puede invertir all all o acull se trata de ver si eso supone o no una diferencia para mejorar la situaci n global del mundo

2262828 sin desconocer su aspiraci n mar tima creo que el problema de bolivia no es el mar sino la cr nica incapacidad pol tica para hacer un proyecto pa s de consenso que les permita aprovechar las riquezas que tienen
2262829 por suerte que la tienen y aspiremos a que la pol tica la logren solucionar y enfocarse en otros temas que los har an un pa s viable pac fico desarrollado y feliz para nosotros un vecino mucho m s f cil para asociarnos lo que ir en beneficio de ambas naciones

2262835 el proceso democr tico y cultural que ejecuta el gobierno boliviano
2262836 el presidente hizo durante 20 minutos una extensa participaci n en la que expuso todos los puntos que nuestro gobierno considera como conspiraci n
2262837 debemos olvidar pol ticamente los cr menes individuales en aras del bien de toda la colectividad

2262841 no dar conferencias de prensa es una forma de censura
2262842 cuando los presidentes se niegan a dar conferencias de prensa est n ejerciendo una forma de censura
2262843 la libertad de expresi n no significa que cada cual diga lo que quiera sino garantizar que todo lo que haya que decir sea dicho y que los ciudadanos cuenten con la informaci n necesaria para poder evaluar a los gobiernos
2262844 un presidente democr tico un candidato democr tico nunca ataca a los medios sino que en todo caso defiende sus posiciones frente a la opini n p blica
2262845 es llamativo que alguien que no da conferencias de prensa o solamente brinda reportajes a periodistas amigos cuestione a la prensa de la manera en que lo hace
2262846 los presidentes tienen la responsabilidad de informar a la opini n p blica acerca de sus pol ticas y de responder preguntas entonces cuando faltan las conferencias de prensa lo que hacen es ejercer una forma de censura cuando no se da ning n tipo de conferencia de prensa el problema es que se est negando a la opini n p blica la informaci n necesaria para evaluar las pol ticas del gobierno por otro lado cuando se dan reportajes a periodistas en los que el poder conf a la distorsi n es doble porque por un lado la informaci n llega a trav s de estos periodistas poco objetivos y por otro se les da a estos medios amigos una posici n indebidamente privilegiada en el debate p blico
2262847 es democr tico que el poder pol tico confronte constantemente con los medios
2262848 un presidente democr tico nunca ataca a los medios sino que defiende sus posiciones frente a la opini n p blica es llamativo que alguien que no va a conferencias de prensa o s lo brinda reportajes a periodistas amigos cuestione a la prensa de la manera en que algunos lo hacen
2262849 que el debate p blico sobre los temas de importancia de mayor importancia sea amplio abierto y robusto
2262850 la corrupci n es la madre de todos los problemas en am rica latina
2262851 you really dont know whats in a banks or insurance companys portfolio until after the fact
2262852 in markets that are very strong and are running very rapidly we likely will tend to lag
2262853 that will allow them to do well regardless of whats going on in the environment around them
2262854 were really trying to understand what makes the company tick in more detail than what you could get from a phone call
2262855 when he left i was surprised because he was very well respected at the company and we thought very highly of him
2262856 so i called him up and tried to understand what it was that he saw at rsc
2262857 developed a valuable niche between the expensive car dealer service operations and the inexpensive single service shops such as oil change outfits
2262858 fox must stop injecting racism prejudice and fear into our political dialogue we intend to hold fox its advertisers and its personalities accountable for foxs attempts to smear the obamas
2262859 he just couldnt do it just wasnt joseph joseph never came home
2262860 under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves
2262861 the principles that thomas jefferson enshrined in the declaration became the guiding principles of the new nation and at every generation americans have rededicated themselves to the belief that all men are created equal with the god given right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
2262862 may it be to the world what i believe it will be to some parts sooner to others later but finally to all the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves and to assume the blessings and security of self government
2262863 we will tell them they are free free to do what they are told to do or else
2262864 government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
2262865 historischen augenblick d a sich der anstieg der ozeane verlangsamte und der planet zu heilen begann
2262866 and i really feel like they can be met in a short period of time
2262867 its generally true that guys who have already graduated from college when they get to the nfl are more successful here and in life
2262868 thats because theyve taken care of business on the field and off the field
2262869 tuesday night he was just excited to be in camp and with the guys in the room
2262870 hes doing a great job as i knew he would
2262871 its not like brandon is going on the shelf the bottom line is the best three linebackers are going to be on the field no matter who they are
2262872 it seems that the arabs are hurrying towards the zionist entity without feeling any patriotic or historical responsibility the arab regimes are competing with each other in pleasing america which is drowning in the slough of iraq and afghanistan however they have not protected themselves and their nations from gods wrath and punishment these regimes are racing to please and to obey the zionists
2262873 they are not surprised by this invitation as it was preceded by the invitation to the enemy prime minister to visit tunisia
2262874 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
2262875 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
2262876 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible team on the field
2262877 we just felt like this was an opportunity to go get somebody of bretts stature and what hes accomplished
2262878 we felt it was in the best interest of the team and when the opportunity presented itself we felt it was the right move for us to make and we went ahead and did it
2262879 we had discussions with him and his agent bus cook
2262880 and were going into this and were going to take this one year at a time and were excited to have brett on the team this year
2262881 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person as a player weve accomplished a lot of good things with chad he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i really appreciate everything hes done
2262882 hopefully we can get something resolved ive been saying that for quite a while now i dont want to say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
2262883 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
2262884 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
2262885 the players want resolution they want what everybody wants to come out here every day and talk about somebody that is not here and then shows up its gone on too long and understandably so they want to play football
2262886 i was told six months seven months it turned out to be two years now so im just ready to get out there and get it going again
2262887 it was like i was training basically to one day get on the field
2262888 there werent any low points i was out there basically focusing on my conditioning just trying to get right in every aspect of the game as far as quick speed
2262889 we cant get to where we lose our cool out here its that time of year guys arent in very good moods out here weve just got to make sure we continue to get better its good to see us compete and those things well get rid of the extracurricular stuff it wasnt anything big a couple of little ones
2262890 i know ill get the jitters a little bit when i go out there because this is my first experience
2262891 ive never seen a game never been part of one i was supposed to go to the super bowl this year but i couldnt go because i was training for the scouting combine so this is going to be exciting
2262892 we think a league given its structure should have some freedom you cant cookie cut it for every program
2262893 in my opinion little league pretty much dictates what you have to do
2262894 if you dont do it they dont care because theyre so popular they tell you to hit the road cal ripken is not as demanding
2262895 little league is about participation its about giving kids a chance to play baseball weve generated rules for participation not just competition
2262896 if youre talking about big picture philosophy theres some competition were trying to service the same group of people
2262897 but we both get discouraged when kids are turned away from youth baseball completely
2262898 penetration levels of humira within each of its six approved uses are still very low
2262899 abbot coming from nowhere now has the opportunity to be the dominant player in that market
2262900 youre getting the benefit of significant diversification across product areas on a global scale
2262901 fight them allah will chastise them at your hands and he will lay them low and give you victory over them and he will console the breasts of folk who are believers
2262902 if preparation for a jihad is terrorism then we are terrorists if defending our honor is extremism then we are extremists if a jihad against our enemies is fundamentalism then we are fundamentalists

2262905 haydar kuffe a muslim scholar and thinker suicide attacks are allowed by religion and they are martyrdom on the way of allah it is because the person who carries out the operation is putting himself in danger in order to get close to allah

2262911 it is dangerous for a democracy when a presidential candidate can lie with impunity change positions on a whim and physically and verbally threaten others and virtually none of it is reported by a besotted media eagerly awaiting the next moment when he might slap their backs in friendship
2262912 the republican party is a dead rotting carcass with a few decrepit old leaders stumbling around like zombies in a horror version of weekend with bernie handcuffed to a corpse
2262913 you went outside and talked to someone one night and left me inside i could see you and i didnt like it that you were outside without me i showed you
2262914 in reality the only possibility of avoiding such a crunch appears to be if a major recession reduces demand and even then such an outcome may only postpone the problem
2262915 dont let t have my car cuz s will make him sell it
2262916 the guy has no core his only principle is winning the presidency
2262917 well i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
2262918 we hold part of the room unreserved but tonight that could be a long wait if you get here around 7 30
2262919 you know i have rights to and i should be allowed to do whatever i want
2262920 i dont see why i have to do what you say all the time i have my own mind and can make my own choices
2262921 im not your servent i shouldnt have to do any of your work
2262922 i cant get in trouble for saying that because i am just saying how i really feel
2262923 i am trying to obey mom you know its like that story that says if you obey you will be happy all day
2262924 mom this is very important for us to know thank you for teaching this to me it is the most important thing in the world
2262925 57 wherefore teach it unto your children that all men everywhere must repent or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of god for no unclean thing can dwell there or cdwell in his presence for in the language of adam man of holiness is his name and the name of his only begotten is the fson of man even jesus christ a righteous judge who shall come in the meridian of time 58 therefore i give unto you a commandment to teach these things freely unto your cchildren saying
2262926 children obey your parents in the lord for this is right
2262927 if it aint broke dont fix it if you break it people aint gonna go
2262928 im sorry but jay z no chance im not having hip hop at glastonbury no way no its wrong
2262929 both audience and artist rose to the occasion and turned in a moment of real euphoric pop culture history
2262930 its brilliantly staged utterly thrilling and it makes gallagher look a bit of a berk
2262931 the only way to balance the market is by choking off demand which would require a spike above 200
2262932 oil has been very cheap now its becoming rather expensive
2262933 everyone expected a normal market response to higher prices would be an expansion of production but that hasnt happened

2262936 i will give the standard to a man who loves allah and his messenger and whom allah and his messenger love
2262937 i am ashamed of the silence of the arab and muslim umma community i will keep saying it every time oh my mother every time oh my sister
2262938 just how long has she had some of this yarn
2262939 how does a kid from brooklyn know anyone in our town no less
2262940 did not come from the boroughs but rather from places like the long island even though their mother and or father often traced his or her heritage to brooklyn
2262941 dude you are not from new york you dont live in manhattan you live in phucking too bad you dont look like him you might get laid more
2262942 son you are so smart you could have been a doctor
2262943 after a rigorous selection procedure the british council entered into a contractual partnership with a consortium led by hotcourses to develop the education uk website and associated databases the other consortium members are ucas csu and yahoo
2262944 we are looking for a head of press to lead our successful press office and to provide professional leadership for media relations staff in over 100 countries and territories worldwide
2262945 working closely with our director communications and chief executive you will be responsible for strengthening our uk media profile
2262946 definitely unethical underhanded and illegal especially if it came from the source i know of
2262947 if it got out they ought to know where it came from
2262948 like rip van winkle the legendary character created by the new york author washington irving new york has slept through much of the past decade while the rest of the world has passed us by today is the day when all of that changes when we stop standing still and start moving forward once more
2262949 at moments when leadership was needed this was a governor whose performance was always adequate it is hardly the kind of summation that makes for a political legend but new yorkers are well aware that it is possible to do worse
2262950 pataki is prepared to give the nation what he gave new york out of control spending corruption political favoritism and neglect
2262951 to suggest that the last 12 years of his leadership were a failure would be a grotesque understatement pataki is an anchor around the ship of state drowning residents in debt and special favors
2262952 mr davidson there is no question that a number of governments do not necessarily like the development of a more open society

2262955 the peak oil alarmists fail to say anything about the vast amounts of oil being found in the gulf of mexico now or the major deal that chevron just did in oil rich angola
2262956 producers such as venezuela could let production fall and nationalize the oil industry because there was no punishment for doing this when prices kept rising
2262957 proponents of peak oil who dont have the foggiest knowledge of petroleum geology
2262958 the peak oil alarmists fail to say anything about the vast amounts of oil being found in the gulf of mexico now or the major deal that chevron just did in oil rich angola
2262959 were really trying to send a message to corporations that were holding them accountable for hiring illegal aliens
2262960 its going to be a study about whether this project is worthy of further consideration whether the whole concept really makes sense nothing more
2262961 get all the necessary documents reissued he said he wrote to albany n y for a birth certificate then used it to get a drivers license in minnesota
2262962 since hed already claimed hed been kidnapped once we felt like there was a good possibility he was faking a disappearance
2262963 the state board has given decatur a chance to resurrect
2262964 that the council was exploring these recommendations he also accepted the call for it to enter into dialogue with competitors about its plans for expansion but he said that dialogue had to work both ways
2262965 we also commission in depth interviews with people who have been involved in bc activities some time after the event to gauge the extent of the impact that activity has had on them
2262966 it is well known that someone coming from outside a situation can often discover weak spots in training organisation and general policy quicker than someone examining such matters from within
2262967 a job well done a history of the palestine police force 1920 1948
2262968 the board has defined the purpose of our public diplomacy effort as delivering the governments goals rather than promoting the uk for its own sake or uk branding
2262969 the council needs to demonstrate more clearly to its stakeholders and competitors how growth supports the councils mission and charitable purposes and that it does not represent unfair competition
2262970 the council should report a balance of positive and negative customer comments through its country and regional scorecard reports in order to promote transparency
2262971 these interviews are undertaken by independent reviewers though in practice council staff have a role in selecting interviewees and sometimes also attend the interviews
2262972 the original advice from the dfid consultant who devised the exercise in the first place was that bc staff should be involved to provide information about the project that has usually not proven to be possible the interviewees are people who have been actively involved in a bc project and are interviewed between 18 and 36 months after their involvement
2262973 the episode neil robertson refers to above took place before the process of in depth interviews i mention was introduced and its unlikely he would have been interviewed anyway as the interviews focus on project participants rather than those who are contracted to deliver the project as i assume and i am as always happy to be corrected mr robertson was
2262974 this report specifically excludes any consideration of the british councils contract work with the british government which seems a complete copout see note 3 page 5 the main exclusion from the scope of the study was the councils work under contract for a range of uk and international agencies mainly in support of international development programmes
2262975 such work is won under competition and at least covers its costs overall primary responsibility for the value for money of the work lies with the agencies procuring it
2262976 we go on holiday in the winter to egypt weve seen the number of russians go up from about 10 in the hotel to 50
2262977 the disputes with the british council have centered on the nature of the organization the foreign ministry maintains that the council is a commercial organization and must pay the requisite taxes and follow the relevant regulations the british council insists that it is a nonprofit organization with the sole function of promoting cultural exchange

2263243 money matters but less than we think and not in the way that we think family is important so are friends envy is toxic so is excessive thinking beaches are optional trust is not neither is gratitude

2263252 is one of those big projects that needs to be done shipping our children out of the county to be placed in another juvenile detention center is just not an option
2263253 i really believe this is an important situation if we can get these children when they are first getting into trouble we can get them turned around
2263254 i want to find a way to build a decent facility i want a place where we can take care of these kids
2263255 when we begin to put more than one juvenile in one room the safety risks go up considerably
2263256 as a county we have a responsibility to make sure the kids are safe while they are here
2263257 will be using our staff better so we can increase the number of kids we take care of because the sight lines would be better and it would be less labor intensive
2263258 when we think childrens books we typically think dragons in far off places alice in wonderland that sort of thing
2263259 but i believe theres a place for fact and history the more i do this work the more im committed to presenting the great figures in history abraham lincoln buzz aldrin amelia earheart
2263260 were living in a time when history seems to be of very low priority and interest in this country particularly among the younger generation
2263261 the lack of awareness of who we are as a nation does bother me if you dont know your history you cant make the most out of tomorrow
2263262 the uams northwest campus will have one of the largest impacts on the quality of life that northwest arkansas has seen yet
2263263 the only place that could provide all of the ingredients necessary was northwest arkansas
2263264 id like to see it become one of the jewels in the crown of northwest arkansas
2263265 we need to be able to demonstrate to the legislators and to the governor that there is local support for this program
2263266 as it is now people from the city of fayetteville arent supporting this
2263267 i wanted to raise a token opposition to what seemed like a good idea a few years ago but now looks like an unsustainable option
2263268 its going to be a study about whether this project is worthy of further consideration whether the whole concept really makes sense nothing more
2263269 we would be better served in fayetteville by expanding our excellent free razorback transit system throughout fayetteville
2263270 my god if every book were that easy to write
2263271 i just happen to use the vehicle of childrens books as way to reach the widest audience i thought about doing more gallery work but it became clear to me doing picture books for children for next generation would be my mission for the rest of my career trying to bring a fine art exposure to children that may have like me never had a exposure to a gallery or museum growing up thats important
2263272 whats gratifying about this exhibition is sharing that work from books as artwork on the wall
2263273 often times you look at a book and dont think of the original artwork used
2263274 i was very visually astute but had difficulty with the verbal
2263275 it wasnt until sixth grade that i had a teacher mr gilkey who read to us on a daily basis mr gilkey was very instrumental in helping me overcome my reading problems
2263276 what you dont see from the creations on the wall and in my books is the tremendous amount of angst and insecurity
2263277 every painting comes up short or less than what you had envisioned except for those moments you know where the chapter writes itself or the painting made itself once youve experience that feeling thats all the addiction you need to keep trying to find it again its so elusive

2263286 when my daughter got sick and lost her job she didnt deserve to lose her life

2263289 you laid yourself down and paid the ultimate price for freedom you are my hero and my commander
2263290 im sorry our country and many of us wont show appreciation for the blood you shed
2263291 theres no appreciation in public work in the end god will reward you far better than anyone else could
2263292 theres a fellowship many of you share for the blood you shed together
2263293 many have never been honored or appreciated except by the pain their wives mothers and children are left with i thank god for each and every one of you and what youve done for this country we owe all great debt to you
2263294 im proud were taking on the challenge of creating a cleaner future its what our children deserve
2263295 puget sound is a basic part of that cleaner future for our health and the environments health but its also an economic driver
2263296 we cannot underestimate the difficulty of this task but we cant underestimate its importance
2263297 by restoring the puget sound were passing our children a legacy that will make us proud and build a stronger economy

2263322 evo morales tiene al pa s preso de sus prejuicios
2263323 estoy dispuesto y quiero construir el futuro con blancos indios y mestizos
2263324 el mundo occidental es portador de valores negativos y el mundo ind gena es portador de valores positivos
2263325 yo quiero pedir al se or insulza secretario general de la oea y a todos los representantes de los pa ses a defender la dignidad de los latinoamericanos de toda am rica no permitir ninguna base militar en latinoam rica
2263326 seguramente me dir n ma ana que hago intromisi n a nigeria pero mi obligaci n es debatir y orientar ante la injusticia y la desigualdad obligados a batallar todos
2263327 no hay ning n conflicto lo que se trata es de respetarnos mutuamente no hay ning n contencioso
2263328 queremos dejar registro que ha habido una actitud reiterada de intromisi n en los asuntos internos del per
2263329 las dificultades que tenemos en las negociaciones con la uni n europea no tienen nada que ver con este incidente tiene que ver con la oposici n que bolivia tiene a la firma de acuerdos de libre comercio que forman parte del acuerdo de asociaci n
2263330 la voluntad de nuestro pa s de mantener una buena relaci n con el pa s vecino sobre la base del respeto mutuo
2263331 esperamos que eso sirva para que en el futuro el se or evo morales se abstenga de seguir interviniendo incluso incitando a la rebeli n como fue lo que hizo en sus ltimas declaraciones
2263332 claramente que el principio sagrado de las relaciones internacionales que es de la no intervenci n de los asuntos internos est siendo violado sistem ticamente por el gobierno de bolivia
2263333 creo que el presidente morales ha asumido un rol para el cual nadie lo ha elegido que es de gu a espiritual y orientador de otros pueblos
2263334 no nos escuchan cuando advertimos del incremento de enfermedades desplazamiento de pueblos ntegros e inundaci n de afluentes
2263335 un an lisis binacional de los efectos econ micos sociales y ambientales
2263336 se precisar multiplicar los equipos de salud en brasil la situaci n se complicar en bolivia porque el estado simplemente no llega a las zonas del norte amaz nico
2263337 estos grupos tendr an que emigrar hacia otras regiones en busca de alimento y espacios habitables ocasionando la invasi n de territorios de otras poblaciones ind genas
2263338 brasil vive con el temor del apag n que sufri en 2001 debido a una crisis energ tica
2263339 se sabe que estas construcciones desencadenan impactos diversos es de esperar que no sean de la magnitud de la que hablan los ambientalistas
2263340 quer amos recordarle al presidente ch vez que l gobierna en venezuela no en toda latinoam rica como escucha a evo morales nos pareci la manera correcta de hacerle llegar nuestras peticiones nunca quisimos provocar enfrentamientos por lo tanto le exigimos un derecho a r plica al canal del estado

2263345 constatado que se ha avanzado mucho en las confianzas mutuas
2263346 a la permanente demanda boliviana por el tema mar timo
2263347 han sido pr cticamente los abanderados que han permitido generar una distensi n en las poblaciones de ambos pa ses
2263348 el pueblo chileno est recibiendo de manera m s directa y veraz el sentimiento boliviano que no es de revancha o de mirar atr s revisando los tratados sino que es un sentimiento de mirar hacia delante en un mundo globalizado que permita a bolivia recuperar su cualidad mar tima aunque no fuera en la extensi n originalmente perdida
2263349 en el tema mar timo hemos visto los avances de ambas canciller as y hemos encontrado un lenguaje diferente vemos un mayor pragmatismo en los criterios de ambos pa ses con respecto al tema mar timo
2263350 el estado cualitativamente superior en la que est n las relaciones entre ambos pa ses
2263351 porque el conocimiento mutuo de ambos pa ses es una cuesti n fundamental
2263352 que tiene grandes recursos naturales que ocupa un lugar central en am rica latina y es eje de las comunicaciones atl ntico pac fico
2263353 impulsar el protocolo para colaboraci n en temas de defensa y tambi n se comprometieron a realizar un seguimiento de los avances de las conversaciones entre ambas canciller as en el tema mar timo
2263354 interceptados cuando intentaban salir del pa s por una senda que conduce a una zona deshabitada de bolivia

2263357 al ser detenidos los gendarmes notaron que transportaban bolsas de trigo sin ninguna documentaci n que avalara su tenencia legal
2263358 los choferes se arriesgaban a transitar por ese camino llevando solamente la mitad de la carga por las grandes posibilidades de volcar
2263359 el gobierno quiere liquidarnos desaparecer las comunidades para entregarle nuestra tierras a los extranjeros a los hacendados a los mineros el kilo de papas lo vendemos a 60 centavos 20 centavos de d lar y el saco de fertlizantes nos lo venden a 240 soles 80 d lares lo que sacamos con las ventas no nos alcanza ni para pagar los costos de producir nos est n matando de hambre y con este tlc todo va a ser peor porque nuestros productos van a bajar todav a m s de precio este gobierno es una desgracia para nosotros

2263369 tom has been instrumental in the restructuring and management of nasas aeronautics research programs since he came to washington in 2004
2263370 he has extensive and well rounded experience in the areas of aeronautics research space station program engineering and management institutional management and nasa administration aeronautics benefits greatly from his presence on my team
2263371 and enjoyed some of his observations especially the bits about meritocracies and how neoliberalism instills people with the misguided notion that success is exclusively related to skill and effort
2263372 when kids are living in poverty and dont have access to a computer to finish their homework assignments a local library is like the
2263373 if they cant get their homework done they miss the opportunity to learn and then they lose the willingness to want to learn
2263374 if we want our kids in poverty to stay in school we need to give them access to libraries
2263375 while reflecting an indisputable aspect of reality it can falsify the actual truth in a most misleading way
2263376 garc a no debe copiar la soberbia mon rquica que es un vicio virreynal que acab en latinoam rica
2263377 al parecer chile es el pa s vecino con el que tenemos mejores relaciones en la actualidad
2263378 hay un deterioro progresivo de las relaciones con per que podr n tener su componente personal pero que tambi n responden a actitudes que no compartimos de nuestro gobierno como inviabilizar las negociaciones entre la comunidad andina y la uni n europea ue o presentar obst culos para que per perfeccione un tlc con ee uu
2263379 como parlamentarios no compartimos que garc a haya maltratado a nuestro presidente en la cumbre
2263380 al parecer chile es el pa s con el que tenemos mejores relaciones en cuanto a nuestros cinco pa ses vecinos lo que es llamativo
2263381 la comunidad internacional puede ayudarnos para afrontar el intervencionismo del presidente hugo ch vez que distorsiona nuestro proceso democr tico con su dinero
2263382 marca un punto de inflexi n porque es el primer departamento en el cual gan el presidente cuando fue electo y corresponde a la parte occidental de cultura de mayor a quechua
2263383 esto debiera convencer a morales de la necesidad de tener un proyecto de constituci n concertado es la soluci n de fondo al conflicto pol tico
2263384 alrededor del congreso siempre hay grupos de choque hostigando a los parlamentarios se es un dato de la realidad
2263385 vamos a llevar este problema por v a diplom tica y no vamos a seguir hablando por los medios
2263386 va a quedar claramente plasmado que el presidente ya no representa a la mayor a de los bolivianos yo creo que el mandato de evo ser revocado
2263387 lo nico que nos queda a los pueblos latinoamericanos es la unidad para poder hacer realidad el sue o de nuestro libertador sim n bol var que era la liberaci n de los pueblos latinoamericanos
2263388 en este momento tan dif cil que estamos viviendo y que estamos enfrentando al imperio en esta lucha para la segunda y definitiva liberaci n del imperio creo que la nica alternativa que tenemos los pueblos latinoamericanos para enfrentar a ese monstruo es la unidad
2263389 lo nico que nos queda a los pueblos latinoamericanos es la unidad para poder hacer realidad el sue o de nuestro libertador sim n bol var que era la liberaci n de los pueblos latinoamericanos

2263405 el tema de la soberan a es irrenunciable para bolivia
2263406 ya hemos superado la poca en que habl bamos de revisar el tratado de 1904
2263407 en lugar de entrar directamente al tema como a una piscina helada vayamos preparando la epidermis para entrar despu s al n cleo que es la soberan a

2263416 hemos encontrado que se va rompiendo ese hielo que durante a os nos ha separado por un lenguaje hostil que ten amos entre chilenos y bolivianos
2263417 en el tema mar timo que es el m s importante hemos superado la poca en que se hablaba de revisar el tratado de 1904
2263418 soluciones pragm ticas que puedan devolverle a bolivia su cualidad mar tima que no quiere decir devolverle los territorios en su extensi n total que tuvo bolivia hist ricamente
2263419 los parlamentarios hemos decidido acompa ar las gestiones de la canciller a los parlamentarios tenemos que contribuir a mejorar las relaciones y agilizar este di logo no ponerle piedras o espantar el nivel de confianzas queremos medir nuestras palabras
2263420 las relaciones entre chile y bolivia est n sin duda en el mejor momento de la historia reciente
2263421 hemos generado un cambio completo en la relaci n chile bolivia sabemos que tenemos una relaci n muy rica donde hay puntos que son los m s complejos como el de la cuesti n mar tima pero queremos avanzar con tiempo pero con firmeza en una resoluci n positiva de todos los temas de la agenda
2263422 bolivia nunca va a renunciar al t rmino de soberan a
2263423 en la cuesti n mar tima todav a obviamente hay diferencias si no no habr a problemas
2263424 despu s de la conversaci n que he sostenido con el canciller del per ayer por la tarde hemos dado por superados
2263425 la llamada del canciller boliviano fue muy oportuna para despejar el ambiente y poder trabajar conjuntamente para beneficio de nuestros pueblos
2263426 nos tenemos que abocar a construir a fortalecer estas relaciones que son muy importantes para nosotros
2263427 los cada vez m s frecuentes procesos de nacionalizaci n explican el rezago de la inversi n en am rica latina
2263428 bolivia ha encarado en los ltimos a os reformas complejas y poco amigables para la inversi n
2263429 afectan menos que la crisis petrolera de la d cada de 1970 ya que las econom as est n cada vez m s especializadas en la provisi n de servicios
2263430 de continuar los altos precios del petr leo el precio del gas tambi n podr a subir
2263431 bolivia est desaprovechando un momento econ mico que es el mejor probablemente en los ltimos 60 70 a os y lo est desaprovechando porque la pol tica energ tica que es nuestro punto m s importante es p sima incoherente
2263432 autoritario en su concepci n y en su desarrollo caudillista y confrontacional
2263433 la teor a de esa utop a estatista de que el estado propietario de los recursos garantiza la lucha contra la pobreza y mejores ingresos tampoco es una cosa matem tica
2263434 la pol tica exterior boliviana est absolutamente condicionada por la venezolana
2263435 con o sin armas estamos comprometidos con el proceso de cambio y estamos dispuestos a dar nuestra vida y sangre por el presidente evo morales
2263436 ojala que las organizaciones irregulares por la v a disuasiva tambi n entreguen las armas y explosivos que tienen sino tendr que actuar la justicia
2263437 unos cuantitos intentan dividir el pa s y apoderarse de algunos departamentos pero nosotros no vamos a permitir nada de eso pedimos al gobierno desmantelar a la uni n juvenil cruce ista

2263441 tenemos mucho de que estar orgullosos y tenemos que buscar nuestra identidad en estas cosas para entender el presente y para planificar el futuro tenemos que ver el pasado
2263442 hemos tenido que trabajar fuertemente con el fin de mostrar la arquitectura los restos que todav a quedan en esa zona para que la gente se d cuenta que tienen valor cultural sumamente importante
2263443 quieren meter el tractor y estoy dispuesto a arrodillarme para suplicarles que no destruyan esto

2263445 de la argentina no hablo preg ntenme de brasil de bolivia de chile pero con la argentina la cosa no est nada bien
2263446 la argentina fue un buen negocio porque entramos en un momento del petr leo bajo eso ya est ya pas pero ahora estamos perdiendo muchos millones en ese pa s
2263447 s claro que s contest porque consideramos que esto es pasajero y que la argentina volver a ser un pa s fuerte confiamos mucho en el pa s pero actualmente est complicado
2263448 como tenemos que cumplir con una cuota de combustible en el mercado interno y no damos abasto pues entonces importamos crudo para refinar pero lo importamos a 140 d lares el barril y lo vendemos mucho m s barato le digo m s a veces ser a necesario espantar los clientes ya que por cada litro de nafta que vendemos perdemos m s
2263449 la energ a enviada a los argentinos proviene de usinas termoel ctricas que estaban desactivadas y fueron reactivadas exclusivamente para atender a esa demanda externa
2263450 por lo tanto a adi esa energ a no nos har falta y no causar prejuicios a la econom a brasile a
2263451 hay una preocupaci n por supuesto y tengo que hablar con mi gobierno
2263452 yo hubiera querido que el presidente george bush tambi n convoque a la agencia de ayuda usaid y de esta manera no haya grupos que est n conspirando contra el gobierno y la democracia en bolivia
2263453 efectivamente estamos en conversaciones con estados unidos para construir un aer dromo militar
2263454 deben constituir una fuente de aprovisionamiento sino que su control tambi n debe estar en manos de nuestros conciudadanos
2263455 desde esta base estados unidos operar a en toda la regi n con su instalaci n el per se estar a involucrando peligrosamente en un conflicto regional
2263456 la determinaci n pol tica de mantener una econom a de guerra permanente utiliz ndola como elemento activador y sostenedor de la econom a del pa s un criterio utilizado desde los primeros a os de la guerra fr a y establecido por el gobierno de harry truman como pol tica econ mica p blica a partir septiembre de 1950 que a n hoy contin a aplic ndose
2263457 yo no me ando fijando en la esbeltez y la gordura de los hombres eso se lo garantizo todav a no est eso dentro de mis inquietudes

2263459 cualquier presidente que manda callar a una persona que es presidente es antidemocr tico
2263460 en el supuesto de que el presidente gane ser dif cil pensar en una victoria porque al menos se va a ratificar la divisi n del pa s y es altamente probable que el presidente pierda en el oriente
2263461 los escenarios que generar el revocatorio ser n m s conflictivos y agravar n las tensiones entre el gobierno nacional y los prefectos entre el partido gobernante y los partidos de oposici n entre las ciudades y las provincias entre el oriente y el occidente
2263462 nunca ha sido tan necesario el acuerdo y nunca ha sido tan distante la posibilidad de lograrlo como este momento
2263463 bolivia es el nico pa s que enfrenta sus problemas de ese modo como la ley aqu no funciona y no hay lealtad institucional los problemas se resuelven de esa forma
2263464 ha sido una entrega no controlada no transparente por ejemplo en cochabamba se hace entrega gratuita de los carnets en la casa de campa a del mas el partido oficialista la situaci n pues es grave
2263465 para que no haya refer ndum revocatorio algunos senadores de podemos oposici n han presentado modificaciones a la ley que querr n hacer con eso que no haya refer ndum revocatorio
2263466 la ley del referendo revocatorio no se mueve el referendo revocatorio se realiza
2263467 la ley del refer ndum revocatorio 3850 es injusta ya que otorga ventajas al presidente de la rep blica de manera antidemocr tica y establece porcentajes de votaci n discriminatorios para los prefectos
2263468 tres pruebas sobre las denuncias de fraude que est consumando el gobierno para el refer ndum revocatorio el presidente de la corte nacional electoral act a a favor del mas en las casas de campa a del mas se extienden carnets de identidad de forma ilegal para votar esta documentaci n es financiada por el gobierno venezolano que en asociaci n delictiva con personeros del gobierno ha participado en actos de terrorismo en el pa s
2263469 no usar a los c vicos de sus departamentos para intentar frenar esa consulta popular porque no representan al pueblo sino a un peque o grupo de familias oligarcas
2263470 permanentemente me exigen cumplir con la ley y con la constituci n hay una ley aprobada en el congreso para el refer ndum revocatorio como ellos me exig an cumplir con la ley yo les pido que sepan cumplir con la ley para el revocatorio
2263471 a ser responsables con las normas aprobadas en el congreso nacional y no estar tramando con otras nuevas leyes de modificaci n que simplemente est n orientado a frenar el refer ndum revocatorio por qu tienen tanto miedo al pueblo
2263472 a m que he ganado con 54 por ciento me piden revocatorio qu miedo
2263473 no le vamos a dar ning n tipo de trato es un juego pol tico
2263474 yo era fan tico admirador de alan garc a era un orador de primera antiimperialista y muy flaco ahora lo veo muy gordo y poco antiimperialista
2263475 yo no me ando fijando en la esbeltez y la gordura de los hombres eso se lo garantizo todav a no est eso dentro de mis inquietudes
2263476 habr a que decir como juan carlos de espa a por qu no te callas m tete en tu pa s y no te metas en el m o y ya est s jalando demasiado la pita as que ten cuidado con las consecuencias de lo que est s haciendo
2263477 y adem s todo est sustentado en groseras mentiras manipulaciones como decir que el per tiene una base de los estados unidos que venga ese se or morales dentro del per y que me diga d nde est la base pero lo mejor que podr a hacer es no meterse en pol tica peruana ni estar dividiendo a los peruanos o estar queriendo enfrentar peruanos con peruanos
2263478 yo lo nico que pienso es que ning n pa s tiene derecho a meterse en la pol tica interna de otro pa s y que evo morales venga aqu a alentar el paro del 9 me parece a mi sencillamente repulsivo
2263479 hay que cerrar el congreso ante el chantaje de los parlamentarios del movimiento nacionalista revolucionario unidad nacional y poder democr tico social podemos que no quieren legislar

2263487 la prensa espa ola oculta el hecho de que la iglesia cat lica fue responsable de la muerte de dos millones de republicanos durante la guerra civil no de un mill n como se afirma
2263488 le dije a himmler el jefe de las ss nazis cuando visit la cantera de mauthausen el 27 de abril de 1941 que los nazis y la iglesia cat lica hac an una gran pareja
2263489 l respondi que era cierto pero que despu s de la guerra les ver a marchar con el papa a la cabeza hacia all se alando el crematorio

2263497 buena parte de la droga elaborada en los sectores de atalaya ucayali y san gab n puno no se dirige a la costa sino a los pa ses fronterizos con madre de dios
2263498 si bien el 80 por ciento de la coca na de san gab n sale a bolivia por desaguadero hay un 20 por ciento que recorre las carreteras de madre de dios para ingresar a la regi n boliviana de pando y al estado brasilero de acre
2263499 la droga procedente de la zona de atalaya ucayali tambi n llega all el viaje puede durar aproximadamente de tres a cuatro d as los costos por tan largo viaje no son altos porque habitualmente la droga es camuflada habitualmente en la carga principal de productos de panllevar para su comercializaci n legal en puerto maldonado

2263533 a newborn killer whale calf is usually 7 8 feet long and 300 400 pounds
2263534 this carcass was approximately five feet long with an estimated weight of 70 80 pounds so its likely this calf was aborted
2263535 if we recover viable skin and blubber which is not always possible from a decomposed carcass we might be able to determine if the calf is a member of the southern resident community and possibly even narrow down the pod of origin
2263536 people watched it from the whale watching boat the big whale tryed to get away but didnt happen working in groups of 2 about 20 of them eating when it was dead and the baby killer whales were jumping and playing in the blood poor tourists were kinda shocked the shipmen said it was really rare to see something like this especially because the killer whales here only eat small fish first time this happened here at least recorded
2263537 researchers have seen everyone else in k pod except k 7 its safe to say shes gone
2263538 the whale population decline is coincident with the deployment of destroyer squadron 9 to everett in 1995
2263539 the destroyer squadrons exercise area is nominally off the olympic peninsula but has included strait of juan de fuca and haro strait

2263543 this is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of materials and thats important because in order to understand the long term evolution of planets we need to know more about their properties deep down
2263544 the finding is also interesting from the point of view of understanding why materials are the way they are and what determines their stability and their physical and chemical properties
2263545 you can imagine this liquid looking like mercury only less reflective
2263546 high temperatures make the atoms jiggle around and so people thought that raising the heat would deflect the electrons like putting enough rocks in a stream to block the flow of water
2263547 the scattering caused by atoms was thought to make it harder for the electrons to flow down the stream
2263548 now we have to look elsewhere for this energy source

2263564 i am somewhat encouraged by the fact that science and technology have progressed to the point where it is less likely now to convict because of dna and other scientific methodologies have allowed us to clear innocent people
2263565 and weve got a whole procedure on the books now that pretty much provides for scientific review if there is any question so you can free innocent people or free innocent people from death row a lot more objectively

2263640 we are unaware of any sugar buyer in this country who is having trouble finding sugar
2263641 and while sugar prices have rebounded in the past couple of months they are still far below price increases for other commodities
2263642 the usdas actions today cast a cloud over a sugar industry that has been dealing with depressed prices and soaring input costs for some time
2263643 it is understood that there are still uncertainties about us domestic production us domestic consumption hurricanes and other risks as well as uncertainties about the actions of mexico
2263644 but these actions should compensate for the lost refining capacity and give the market some insurance in case of any unanticipated interruptions
2263645 this action is exactly why congress wrote the new farm bill in a way that would remove speculation from the equation and add certainty to future trq announcements by instructing the usda to wait until we know the size of the us and mexican crops before increasing imports above traditional levels

2263649 the vast majority of beef sold in australia is finished on grain in feedlots
2263650 retail gross margins on beef are low by comparison to most other categories of products sold by the mscs further suggesting strong retail competition
2263651 while the accc did not obtain information on the mscs gross margins for beef specifically
2263652 the accc report has two pages discussing the abas data from the usda that showed us beef producers receive 20 40pc more for their cattle compared to australian producers while us consumers pay about half as much as australians for their beef in the supermarket
2263653 aba also presented data that showed a similar pattern in the uk and ireland
2263654 the accc is reluctant to draw any conclusion from the international comparisons the acccs conclusion is based on advice from daff and nff who said that international comparisons are difficult
2263655 the report lists many other international comparisons but apparently regards beef as being difficult

2263695 if we view educational environments as means to learner independence blackboard are sometimes the opposite of this really too constrained rigid
2263696 our purpose is to ask regarding communities of inquiry how do we faciliate these communities how do these dynamics impact our ability to facilitate them
2263697 but whats the medium and how does it effect these three presences

2263717 the average anglican in our world today is black female and in her late teens or early twenties
2263718 the epidemiological evidence through culture society and immigration studies is so strong eighty percent of the studies show an inverse relationship between fruits and vegetables and cancer
2263719 i think the data is very consistent on fruits vegetables and cancer
2263720 theres no magic fruit diversity moderation and balance in the diet are key
2263721 so far the strongest evidence for the cancer fighting properties of plant foods is epidemiological ars wants to go into controlled feeding studies where we know exactly what people are eating
2263722 this goes back to the way we studied heart disease people who ate a lot of saturated fat had heart disease people who eat a lot of fruits and vegetables are protected from some cancers heart disease and macular degeneration we want to see how much produce it takes to overcome cancer we believe that you can take someone who is healthy with no signs or symptoms of cancer and over time if they eat fruits and vegetables their risk of cancer is lowered they have little assaults on their bodies but can interrupt the assaults with a diet high in fruits and vegetables
2263723 its one thing to say a food is high in a phytonutrient but we need to know if we can find it in blood plasma or in tissue and if we can find it we want to know how the phytonutrient works what is the mechanism
2263724 for example we know that some phytonutrients turn on enzymes in the body that are healing broccoli has sulforaphane that turns on enzymes that detoxify substances in the liver that might be carcinogenic it the reaction is being done in the lab how can we test it in humans we cant take a piece of someones liver to test
2263725 epidemiological studies show that it doesnt take that much if people would actually eat five servings a day of fruits and vegetables theyd be fine actually people are eating more fruits and vegetables than in previous years but theyre only eating two servings of deep green and two servings of deep yellow vegetables were eating a lot of potatoes
2263726 different fruits and vegetables have different nutrient and phytochemical profiles for example you can have strawberries and oranges both are high in vitamin c but their phytochemical profiles are different and youll have different benefits
2263727 try a wide selection of vegetables as well cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and brussels sprouts have phytochemicals that are different than those in the allium family of onions and scallions
2263728 lycopene a carotenoid that may reduce prostate cancer risk is a little more available in cooked tomatoes does that mean we should only eat cooked tomatoes no eat a variety of foods thats the important thing

2263734 did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us on the road and while he opened the scriptures to us
2263735 we ought to obey god rather than men the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree him god has exalted to his right hand to be prince and savior to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses to these things and so also is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him
2263736 its not that americans will lose enthusiasm for lbs these changing shares of global lbs revenue just reflect the fact that a market which for technical reasons has been largely restricted to north america will finally grow strongly in other world regions
2263737 since most lbs application developers sell to the world and most of their products are platform agnostic the cost per service for users is likely to be similar in all regions
2263738 however a navigation service can cost as much as 9 99 month whereas friend finder services might only be 2 99 on that basis as well as via cultural preferences particular services will be popular to differing degrees in different regions that can affect the total revenue to be generated from a particular region
2263739 nokias announcement that it expects half of its mobiles to have gps by 2010 12 should not surprise the steadily falling cost of technology means that every year the number of functions that could be included in a device grows
2263740 at present navigation may make sense for mobile handsets the addition of gps technology and mapping software could allow handset vendors to raise prices or at least slow price declines it may also help individual vendors gain market share in addition manufacturers are also considering how location functionality could provide additional revenue streams on top of handset sales
2263741 while mobile gps may be good news for vendors operators may find it harder to monetize this technology operators should try to understand how the technology could be used to enhance the value of other existing services such as messaging or serve as the platform for entirely new ones such as social networking or treasure hunts
2263742 while the combination of gps and mobile phones should ultimately be a success the industry cannot afford to overlook several critical differences between the use of satellite navigation in vehicles and that by pedestrians
2263743 thus while a growing number of gps enabled mobile phones may be shipped and sold aside from the initial novelty they may not be used very often this may mean additional costs for the manufacturers and operators but little added value

2263750 flexible secure conditional access systems will be key not only in assuring revenues for operators but also in encouraging content owners to offer high quality content which in turn will drive consumer uptake
2263751 the opportunity to leverage standardized conditional access systems in conjunction with flo technology was identified and driven by several flo forum members
2263752 these members took the initiative in adapting to flo the dvb osf taking advantage of previous implementations and quickening the introduction of openca based flo networks in the future the completion of the openca framework highlights the flo forums commitment to the global open standardization of flo technology and is a testament to the dedication and support of our valued members

2263766 my father nearly cried but i was rather thrilled with it i realised it shouldnt be changed

2263768 old plaster has a different resonance it is not only softer but is pitted like the face of a beautiful old woman
2263769 damp courses are totally irrelevant in a house like this its all in the plaster
2263770 britain has a tradition of dried meat just like italy my philosophy is it is not just good enough having the old ham hooks youve got to hang a ham from them

2263786 he told us his story and its unbelievable we are honored to have him carry the flag to hear all the different things that he went through to get this opportunity is unbelievable i think some of those things we take for granted
2263787 not for one moment did i think it was a political statement
2263788 we had a great opportunity to meet him in colorado in our last training camp and we feel its a great choice by the u s delegation
2263789 his story alone just represents the epitome of the american dream and its something the whole world should look at and read about and view as an inspirational story were very proud to follow him at the opening ceremonies

2263800 merchants in north america and western europe are just starting to realise the potential of a mobile web presence as a fourth channel to market retailers should be evaluating the benefits of the mobile web and be mindful of the success of regular ecommerce sites in generating sales they need to move quickly to exploit the opportunity presented and ensure that they maintain ease of use for their customers who are already familiar with web shopping from their pcs
2263801 despite unprecedented growth in the number of cell phone users and the advancement of mobile technologies telecom providers online retailers and financial institutions seem unable to convince consumers worldwide that a secure platform exists for conducting online mobile transactions
2263802 there is a great deal of money to be made in mobile payments but only when consumers believe that the security of the transaction meets or exceeds the freedom of using mobile devices
2263803 sex and sensibility why are some guys losing the latex
2263804 with business mobile needs constantly evolving it is becoming increasingly important for organisations to be able to manage their device fleet in a cost effective and time efficient way orange device
2263805 open standards and interoperability are critical success factors for our carrier customers
2263806 following our recent acquisition of the openwave messaging and browser business it is important to provide our joint customers with a clear statement of our ongoing commitment to working with openwave to test our embedded client software
2263807 we are pleased to confirm our commitment to this program
2263808 openwave places the highest priority on meeting our customer needs and interoperability is key amongst these working with purple labs on this program ensures a continuity of service for our joint customers
2263809 third party reporting will assist us create a clearer picture of the true nature of incidents of hate crime and help us develop strategies to prevent and deter and stop people becoming repeat victims
2263810 we will not tolerate hate crime in and will act robustly to identify those responsible and ensure they are brought to justice we do not want victims to suffer in silence
2263811 we want the people who make traditional cumberland sausages in the county to have the same kind of protection that many producers across europe are already benefiting from
2263812 producers in other areas who have registered their products for protection have also enjoyed greater awareness across europe
2263813 so if the application is successful cumbrian producers will have good reason to celebrate
2263814 the figures show that cumbrian parents have continued to support mmr in very large numbers and compared to the many other parts of the country our children are well protected
2263815 i am concerned though that we get as many children as possible fully protected being a tourist destination it is possible that people may bring measles into the county
2263816 also young people entering higher education may be mixing with fellow students who have not had mmr and this raises the possibility of outbreaks
2263817 one of my favourite clients has got a nice little home in palm beach a castle in england a rather stately home outside of chicago hes got a world class english furniture collection but he knows nothing about wine
2263818 so hell say scotty can you go get me about two thirds white and one third red and heres a six figure allotment to go do that
2263819 wine is the new must have thing of the ultra rich
2263820 nothing says im rich like pulling a 10 000 5 000 cork out of a bottle and in cultures like asia and russia that sort of behaviour is really a part of new wealth
2263821 i never imagined that the wine auction business would be this strong
2263822 when we first started off we had a business plan and within a few months we had to rip it up we were just so exceeding our numbers because of the huge interest there is in wine
2263823 before the first auction we were hoping we could make 500 000 or 1m at an auction
2263824 now weve auctions making 5m 6m 7m and were doing about 10 or 12 auctions a year
2263825 it was in the mid 1970s which was the last time the wine market actually crashed and i think for a lot of people who are very interested in the subject of investing in wine they have never seen that phenomenon
2263826 theres been a long long bull market if you will in wine since that time thats only accelerated in recent years
2263827 with art you can collect it and enjoy it at the same time
2263828 unless you are into the pleasures of simply looking at bottles the only way to enjoy a wine collection is to open the bottles and consume whats inside so you have just destroyed the value if you will of that particular piece of your collection
2263829 the expensive thing when you bought wine was not the liquid it was the bottle
2263830 and up to 1840 or 1850 no matter how expensive the wine was the bottle was always worth more
2263831 domaine de la roman e conti one of the best red burgundies if you can find a case for 2005 now apparently it will cost you 70 000 for that case
2263832 we will try and make sure that the market is a bit more fair than simply one person having complete control and using it as a commodity really as opposed to various bottles of slightly intoxicating fermented grape juice which is really what we are talking about in the end
2263833 random or an act of road rage they got followed they got stopped they got hit
2263834 i am so thankful this accomplishment has finally come to an end hector was a true soldier
2263835 im sorry it took so long and pray it doesnt happen again to other fallen troops
2263836 whether you agree or disagree with the war we must continue to support our troops
2263837 i think we need more people honoring those who have passed in the war
2263838 this is beautiful and wonderful for him its honoring him this is the opening of the doors for many other men to have streets named after them
2263839 i saw crushing wounds but there were very few walking wounded

2263919 when i came across the barn it already had planning permission to knock it down and build from scratch but when i saw the wonderful northampton stone and beautiful original exposed beams i decided rescue it and make it a truly remarkable home
2263920 the sound we get from the amina speakers is fantastic the detail is unlike anything ive heard from conventional speakers and the way they fill the whole space is truly phenomenal but what we really love is that there is no intrusion into the room the birch panelling really complements the original beams and stonework meaning the whole interior design maintains its integrity

2263946 maar hij was ook een eenling een markant figuur hij wist op den duur niet hoe hij moest omgaan met zijn talent hij kon de werkelijkheid niet altijd van fictie onderscheiden soms liep hij dagenlang met zijn toneelkostuums over straat wellicht is hij te snel en te vroeg bekend geworden
2263947 ze zagen elkaar nog af en toe dan belde hij muri l op met de vraag of zij meedeed aan vreemde seksspelletjes die hij wilde spelen daarin zocht hij zijn vertier dat vertelde mijn dochter mij weleens
2263948 met pinksteren was ze ook door hem gebeld of ze wilde komen om te praten dat gesprek is niet goed verlopen ze is toen naar huis gekomen met het verhaal dat ze aram niet meer wilde zien omdat hij door de drugs agressief en volgens haar erg gevaarlijk was geworden ik begrijp dan ook niet dat zij zondag jl naar hem is teruggegaan
2263949 hij had tegen mijn dochter gezegd ik zit in de problemen er is iets verschrikkelijks gebeurd jij bent de enige die mij nog kan helpen ze leende de fiets van haar buurvrouw en ging naar hem toe ze kwam niet meer terug haar goedheid want ze had een hart van goud is haar fataal geworden
2263950 i saw a void in the music industry for a movement of female artists that were unapologetic had something to say were a bit rock n roll and a bit pop

2263956 eventually i want to focus on being a completely different person because i dont want to be doing this into my 40s and 50s and beyond like the rolling stones

2263958 the new tunes are taking them in a much funkier direction i think this next album will be their finest moment
2263959 youre always trying to do something special for sugababes because theyre no ordinary pop band
2263960 we get a bit of flak for just being a duo and not having a bassist but i think less is more
2263961 being in a duo you have that feeling that you have to give 110 every night you cant have a bad gig or rely on anyone else except yourself
2263962 if were not on it it impacts on the fans
2263963 were fans of bands like the white stripes and the dresden dolls who are a duo but have enormous energy even nirvana who admittedly had three members made a big noise
2263964 we had to calm down from what we were doing at our first shows because it was a relentless party every night

2263972 the only way to balance the market is by choking off demand which would require a spike above 200
2263973 oil has been very cheap now its becoming rather expensive
2263974 everyone expected a normal market response to higher prices would be an expansion of production but that hasnt happened
2263975 sometimes we try to manage people who truly believe they are super heroes but in reality have flaws just like hancock that we must work around to be effective

2263977 there are three rotifers in a row on the edge of a barnacle the rotifer on the left spins its tentacles clockwise drawing passing food into itself the rotifer on the right spins its tentacles counter clockwise the rotifer in the middle cant spin its tentacle either clockwise or counter clockwise without entangling them with one of its neighbors instead it repositions itself upside down and eats the barnacle the left and right rotifers stare at their now bloated comrade and one comments thats what happens when you dont exercise
2263978 why shouldnt we quarrel about a word what is the good of words if they arent important enough to quarrel over why do we choose one word more than another if there isnt any difference between them
2263979 do you cherish that of god within you that his power growing in you may rule your life do you seek to follow jesus who shows us the father and teaches us the way

2263985 the universe was structured in accord with the human mental categories that people of biblical times recognized and personified as spirits
2263986 why shouldnt we quarrel about a word what is the good of words if they arent important enough to quarrel over why do we choose one word more than another if there isnt any difference between them
2263987 give a man a fish and you feed him for a day teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
2263988 is it nothing to you all you who pass by
2263989 no it is not nothing to me i accept the sacrifice of jesus for me i want to follow him
2263990 is it nothing to you all you who pass by
2263991 who do you think would be a more terrible mother paris hilton or amy winehouse
2263992 and then i have to get up and track it down and then go get something to kill it and i cant just get say toilet paper because those dont do the job
2263993 keep your eye on it and ill get something to kill it with
2263994 then i go down to the garage and because we dont have a power sander i bring back a giant high top sneaker and say

2264010 anybody in the country who cares about children should be outraged that we have a supreme court that would issue a decision like this
2264011 creating a situation where the country is a less safe place to grow up
2264012 data obtained from cell phones gpss and other sources is used to display the dynamic behavior of people events transportation systems etc in the map one can see the density of active cell phones and other additional information and observe their evolution during that night
2264013 although the city already contains several classes of actuators such as traffic lights and remotely updated street signage a much more flexible actuator would be the citys own inhabitants
2264014 consequently we are creating a new platform for storing and exchanging data which are location and time sensitive making them accessible to users through mobile devices web interfaces and physical interface objects this platform enables people to become distributed intelligent actuators which pursue their individual interests in cooperation and competition with others and thus become prime actors themselves in improving the efficiency of urban systems
2264015 reside a series of studies in visualization that address exactly this problem but deciding whats the appropriate detail is is not trivial in this case because the data is transient and density can change
2264016 the president is going to declare a state of martial law within a few hours
2264017 russia has bombed the black sea port of poti and the military base at senaki we think russia has started to bomb civil and economic infrastructure

2264023 essentially i need this boy to go to the toilet then feel better for me to feel better im going to keep checking him every 10 mins or so and well be better able to decide in about half an hour what kind of help do we have access to can you find out

2264089 our challenge is to get people persuaded that we can make progress when theres not evidence of that in their daily lives
2264090 you go into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them
2264091 and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
2264092 pennsylvanians dont need a president who looks down on them they need a president who stands up for them who fights for them
2264093 it shows an elitism and condescension towards hardworking americans that is nothing short of breathtaking
2264094 it is hard to imagine someone running for president of the united states who is more out of touch with average americans
2264095 they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
2264096 maybe hillary has shared her 109 million with you sorry dear you are definitely out of touch
2264097 religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions it is the opium of the people
2264098 break them in half and throw them just to the side of the alligators mouth
2264099 the birds may mob you if they see you have food theyll attack you
2264100 look hes not even two what do you expect hes very bright for a toddler
2264101 i was just joking when i said it why you take everything so seriously one
2264102 the problem is not going to go away confront it or its only going to get bigger
2264103 robert spencer and i have discussed the perceived differences in our view of islam he and i concluded that although we have different emphases he deals more with scriptures i more with history we have no disagreements
2264104 please dont say anything radical let us proceed very carefully and tiptoe on eggshells or we will make our pc mc masters more angry with us than they already are
2264105 we have to do everything we can in order to defend our nations our cultures our civilization this includes not being politically and morally stupid and failing to recognize the astonishingly low level of understanding that still prevails among most of our countrymen we have a moral obligation not to shoot ourselves in the foot
2264106 maybe he meant to say that a secular person is one who doesnt allow his personal faith to interfere with how he deals with people and issues when his faith isnt involved thats the only interpretation that would support his theory about secular muslims above
2264107 consequently daniel pipess formulation that radical islam is the problem but moderate islam is the solution is valid only when it is understood that the moderate islam that is the solution has to be invented it is not a traditional form of islam
2264108 spencers hyper cautiously politic conduct in this general domain makes me think of a second tier form of the primary appeasement of dhimmitude
2264109 the second tier while ostensibly committed to fighting to stave off islamic supremacism believes in trying to enter into a working relationship with the pc mc crowd who dominate the sociopolitical culture and institutions for the purpose of organizational survival and with the hope that in the future their percolating influence will cause a favorable paradigm shift in pc mc
2264110 this is all based on a hypothesis that being rhetorically and programmatically hyper cautious is the only way for the anti jihad movement to gain sociopolitical traction this hypothesis has not been tested and only indirect indications exist by which to supposedly prove it such as pipes being published in a few mainstream venues spencer being invited to more round tables than he could have otherwise etc
2264111 actually on the very same thread that anonymous quoted here spencer was specific about his variance from pipes view
2264112 consequently daniel pipess formulation that radical islam is the problem but moderate islam is the solution is valid only when it is understood that the moderate islam that is the solution has to be invented it is not a traditional form of islam
2264113 pipes further remarks about he and spencer in agreement are obviously not on that differing point for in reality no one is identical in their positions across the board but rather an admission of general collusion and common purpose
2264114 pipes was responding to a challenge to his position about moderate islam from a commenter that appeared to drive a wedge between pipes and spencer as incompatible critics of islam based on their divergent view of
2264115 there are those like spencer pipes and others who believe this method of strength in numbers while largely ignoring the minutiae of difference between their individual positions
2264116 spencers hyper cautiously politic conduct in this general domain makes me think of a second tier form of the primary appeasement of dhimmitude
2264117 pc destroys the general ability of the west to defend itself against the islamic onslaught that being said does not eliminate the obstacle of pc mc your goals are lofty in that you require to eliminate pc mc in one fell swoop to begin the equally daunting task of destroying islam
2264118 although not an adherent to political correctness as you baselessly accuse him spencer of
2264119 pc wasnt constructed in a day and neither a day will it take for its requiste destruction
2264120 to date i maintain that in this pc mc climate that the cautious approach has worked and is far more efficient than the
2264121 errr raymond ibrahim wrote this article not robert spencer but your disdain is noted i am sure we will now see some sort of astaire like tap dancing from you about how that fact does not matter and that by allowing it to be posted is tacit support by spencer at best
2264122 it is not disimilar to how you believed that hugh could not respond critically to which he did but once again did not criticize as you see fit
2264123 smart people know enough to work hard to get their dreams
2264124 mommy i had a great party and i apperciated every gift i got i like them all
2264125 what blessed wealth in the hands of a blessed righteous person
2264126 oh my lord in whose hands will you put my trust in are you putting my trust in the hands of a near relative who will frown at me or someone far from me to have control of my affair
2264127 as long as you are not angry at me then it doesnt matter
2264128 every time you doubt intentions of others that means your intentions are not pure
2264129 what if all the sahabas would have asked people in those days to give them what they have to learn quran sunnah and aqidah from them just to make the students become serious
2264130 conversamos con la gente del lugar colomi y ellos nos informaron que el domingo el cielo estaba muy cerrado nublado para confirmar esta informaci n necesitamos una foto satelital de la zona
2264131 chile ha ocupado el litoral y se ha apoderado de l con el mismo t tulo con que alemania anex al imperio la alsacia y la lorena que el litoral es rico y vale millones eso ya lo sabemos lo guardamos porque vale que si nada valiera no habr a inter s en su conservaci n
2264132 una miop a pol tica que posterga una alianza potente entre ambos pa ses que genere competitividad para que juntos podamos insertarnos en los mercados globales usando la plataforma litoral y portuaria del pac fico
2264133 chile deber a entregar a bolivia un enclave en el litoral norte el sector m s l gico y de significaci n hist rica ser a la bah a de cobija bajo la condici n jur dica que bolivia estime pertinente
2264134 como reciprocidad bolivia entregar a una superficie equivalente que permita a chile establecer un emplazamiento de acceso a las hidrov as idealmente en puerto su rez en las mismas condiciones jur dicas del enclave litoral
2264135 en una alianza estrat gica para hacer viable un emprendimiento de alto valor comercial social y cultural que est llamado a configurar una nueva geograf a econ mica generando nuevos espacios de influencia a los puertos mar timos y fluviales de una potente cuenca geoecon mica que alcanza al sur de brasil paraguay norte de argentina bolivia y chile
2264136 el 2005 tambi n tuvimos durante un mes a aduaneros bolivianos prepar ndose para el tema del libre tr nsito siempre damos a conocer el puerto en todo bolivia brasil y el noreste argentino por ejemplo logramos sacar 40 mil toneladas de algod n brasile o para china por iquique
2264137 nuestra principal ventaja es la frecuencia naviera tenemos un promedio mensual de buques al asia de 26 naves a diferencia de arica que llega a las 15 y antofagasta con 12
2264138 el 2009 brasil debe sacar 40 millones de toneladas de soya y con el corredor estamos equidistantes del atl ntico pero nosotros tenemos la gran salida al pac fico y desde iquique a china los buques demoran 18 d as imag nate que logremos sacar s lo 1 mill n de esas 40 toneladas de ah en adelante las proyecciones son s lo positivas
2264139 en los que m s puestos de trabajo se est n perdiendo con la crisis
2264140 muchos de los que han perdido sus empleos ya han encontrado trabajo en el sector agr cola
2264141 la directiva supone un endurecimiento de la pol tica migratoria europea pero tenemos que ser conscientes de que es un error vincular la irregularidad administrativa con la delincuencia
2264142 rechazamos la directiva de retorno pero al mismo tiempo hacemos una llamada al retorno
2264143 conf an en el discurso del gobierno espa ol de que se respetar n las garant as legales en el tratamiento a los inmigrantes y los derechos humanos de los mismos
2264144 los lazos comunes entre espa a y bolivia adem s del hecho de compartir cultura o religi n propician el entendimiento entre ambos pa ses
2264145 en bolivia en realidad continuamos con plena marcha el proceso para las respectivas convocatorias a refer ndum por el revocatorio correspondiente que se va a llevar a cabo en el d a 10 de agosto los prefectos que no son afines al gobierno han podido tomar cartas en el asunto porque en primera instancia rechazaron indicaron que no participar an en dicho evento
2264146 como fueron ellos los primeros que solicitaron que la decisi n para continuar o no en el cargo ser a del pueblo es que el presidente el a o pasado hab a mandado un proyecto de revocatoria en este entendido el mes pasado el congreso de la rep blica ha remitido al poder ejecutivo y ha aprobado dicha ley para la convocatoria al refer ndum
2264147 el presidente de la rep blica inmediatamente promulg dicha ley y en esta instancia los prefectos mandaron una nota haciendo conocer que no participar an en dicho evento electoral pero al poco tiempo de los cinco prefectos que hab an firmado cuatro estuvieron ya de acuerdo en ingresar al refer ndum salvo el prefecto de cochabamba
2264148 estamos en la obligaci n de difundir el trabajo que est n realizando y en ese sentido es que hemos recibido hace unos d as los documentos del informe de actividades del gobierno hasta mediados de la gesti n 2008
2264149 nosotros estar amos insertados porque es lo que corresponde a la canciller a de la rep blica se ha recibido tambi n de parte del canciller un informe muy particular que se va a dar a conocer a toda la provincia para que conozcan el plan de trabajo de la pol tica exterior de bolivia ah se demuestra claramente qu es lo que ha hecho la canciller a y cu les han sido los avances en materia internacional
2264150 justamente coincide nuestro aniversario con el aniversario de la provincia de jujuy en este sentido hemos podido analizar y tener reuniones en forma conjunta con el intendente donde coincidimos plenamente en efectuar un acto solemne y patri tico se va a llevar a cabo el d a 6 a horas 10 de la ma ana al pie del monumento belgrano con presencia de las autoridades e invitados especiales
2264151 el proceso de cambio en bolivia va seguir costando sangre
2264152 dolor llanto y luto entre las familias que apostamos por el cambio en bolivia en latinoam rica en suram rica un proceso que tantas luchas ha costado para cambiar bolivia
2264153 el proceso de cambio en bolivia va a seguir costando sangre algunos luchando y algunos como los pilotos sirviendo al pueblo boliviano
2264154 su entrega y sacrificio los ubica en la tradici n de la solidaridad bolivariana
2264155 cruzar fronteras patrias para sembrar la libertad soberan a y esperanza en am rica
2264156 no podemos guardar silencio ante esta tremenda irregularidad y como venezolanos exigimos al gobierno que responda por esta situaci n porque los venezolanos estamos preocupados por esta carrera intervencionista que est llevando adelante el presidente de la rep blica hugo ch vez fr as en bolivia
2264157 el propio ministro de la defensa de bolivia general walter sanmiguel reconoci con sus propias palabras que ese helic ptero fue utilizado por el presidente de la rep blica evo morales llev ndolo a un acto pol tico a la regi n sure a de oruro y posteriormente esta misma aeronave fue a cochabamba para reabastecerse y reacondicionarse con la finalidad de viajar a cobija al norte de bolivia
2264158 es inmensa la cantidad de recursos que el gobierno de venezuela ha venido obsequiando y prestando para solucionar dificultades de otros pa ses y se ha llegado al extremo de usar dinero venezolano para satisfacer necesidades de vivienda y carreteras escuelas alumbrado p blico de comunidades de frica asia estados unidos inglaterra y otros
2264159 mientras que en venezuela se sufren toda serie de calamidades
2264160 por qu venezuela hace este tipo de pr stamos sin que el pueblo lo sepa
2264161 la cantidad de dinero que se le da no s lo a bolivia sino a cuba a nicaragua o a argentina
2264162 las razones por las cuales militares venezolanos intervienen en territorio boliviano y por qu el presidente de bolivia evo morales ten a asignado ese helic ptero de nuestro pa s no s lo se perdi un helic ptero super puma que cuesta millones de d lares sino que perdieron la vida cuatro venezolanos
2264163 no es posible que los recursos del pa s sigan invirti ndose en armas y en equipos militares
2264164 mientras los venezolanos pobres esos que l ch vez dice que quiere mucho son asesinados a diario por las bandas armadas ilegales el presidente nos convoca nuevamente a una gran guerra a trav s de la compra de submarinos y el gasto de millones de d lares en diferentes tipos de armamentos
2264165 como h roes m rtires de la revoluci n bolivariana
2264166 en momentos en que emprendemos viaje a europa para cumplir ineludibles compromisos recibimos la terrible noticia de la muerte de nuestros compa eros de armas
2264167 nada puede mitigar el dolor de familiares amigos compa eros de armas y de todos los venezolanos y venezolanas por la p rdida de estos j venes militares ubicados entre los mejores de su generaci n ca dos cuando valiente y generosamente ayudaban a una naci n bolivariana
2264168 su entrega y sacrificio remata los ubica en la tradici n de la solidaridad bolivariana que siempre condujo a nuestros ej rcitos a cruzar las fronteras patrias para sembrar libertad soberan a y esperanzas en nuestra am rica
2264169 hemos expresado nuestro sentimiento de condolencia al presidente comandante hugo ch vez y palabras de aliento para el pueblo venezolano que coopera tengo un gran dolor llanto y luto
2264170 estos accidentes llaman la atenci n porque se trata de la seguridad del presidente es una situaci n que preocupa esperamos que venezuela tome m s en serio las condiciones de estas aeronaves
2264171 no s lo se perdi una nave que cuesta millones de d lares perdieron la vida cuatro venezolanos esto es insoportable
2264172 es usual toparse con venezolanos en restaurantes y hoteles de ciudades como la paz y cochabamba en cantidades inusitadas pero no hay un censo ni un dato de qu hacen ac
2264173 hay algo raro que est ocurriendo parece que existe la idea de atentar contra la vida del presidente
2264174 ante la presencia extranjera hemos pedido a esta administraci n que se vuelva a nacionalizar la pol tica y el gobierno boliviano
2264175 d jenme vivir tranquilo los ltimos a os de mi vida
2264176 me han tratado como a un delincuente esta situaci n es peligrosa para mi salud mis hijos ser n responsables de lo que me pueda suceder
2264177 a felipe tudela nadie lo ha declarado incapaz es un hombre casado y resulta que no puede vivir libremente donde desee esto es francamente demencial y todo impulsado por los hijos que lo nico que quieren es la plata
2264178 la jueza considera que don felipe no se encuentra en su total capacidad para decidir respecto de su persona y de sus bienes es por ello que le otorga la responsabilidad a don francisco tudela de ser el custodio de su padre y el administrador de sus bienes rindiendo cuentas al juzgado que tendr finalmente la ltima palabra
2264179 lo que hemos descubierto es un hombre cari oso un hombre que nos quiere un hombre que no desea el conflicto que es constantemente hostigado por la gente que tiene alrededor y que tiene miedo
2264180 fuimos emboscados por leandro rea o del estudio rodrigo dos abogados bolivianos dos fiscales bolivianos augusta mar a aljov n y su esposo quienes no permitieron que nos reuni ramos a solas
2264181 el siguiente paso es regresar al per y seguir en la v a judicial que es mandar un exhorto y pedir la deportaci n de estas personas al per
2264182 desde hoy ser representante legal de su padre quien ha quedado privado de sus derechos civiles eso quiere decir que desde ma ana hoy francisco tudela ejercer la administraci n de todos los bienes y el cuidado de su padre
2264183 el despacho llega al convencimiento de que el se or felipe tudela y barreda presenta menoscabo mental que si bien no lo priva totalmente de discernimiento s le impide expresar libremente su voluntad encontr ndose por lo tanto en el supuesto recogido en el inciso 3 del art culo 44 del c digo civil como un incapaz relativo
2264184 la se ora graciela losada vulnera la integridad individual de don felipe tudela y barreda poniendo en riesgo su vida
2264185 tuvimos una reuni n con la jueza quien reconoci que se hab an cometido vicios procesales
2264186 jam s he manipulado a mi esposo para quitarle sus bienes l no es ning n idiota yo pelear para protegerlo mientras est viva es obvio que sus hijos lo nico que quieren es apropiarse de la herencia fue lo primero que pidieron reci n ahora dicen que quieren tener a su padre al lado
2264187 ellos siempre han querido separarlo de mi lado pero luchar hasta el ltimo cartucho porque es mi esposo y es mi derecho
2264188 graciela ha huido y no est pedida por la justicia eso es un indicio grave
2264189 nunca he abandonado a mi esposo cuando me avisaron que hab a sido detenido estaba con mis nietos fuera de santa cruz por el fin de semana los abogados aconsejaron que me quedara en el campo y reci n hoy me autorizaron a volver
2264190 desde hoy ser representante legal de su padre quien ha quedado privado de sus derechos civiles eso quiere decir que desde ma ana hoy francisco tudela ejercer la administraci n de todos los bienes y el cuidado de su padre
2264191 el despacho llega al convencimiento de que el se or felipe tudela y barreda presenta menoscabo mental que si bien no lo priva totalmente de discernimiento s le impide expresar libremente su voluntad encontr ndose por lo tanto en el supuesto recogido en el inciso 3 del art culo 44 del c digo civil como un incapaz relativo
2264192 la se ora graciela losada vulnera la integridad individual de don felipe tudela y barreda poniendo en riesgo su vida
2264193 tuvimos una reuni n con la jueza quien reconoci que se hab an cometido vicios procesales

2264195 ellos siempre han querido separarlo de mi lado pero luchar hasta el ltimo cartucho porque es mi esposo y es mi derecho
2264196 graciela ha huido y no est pedida por la justicia eso es un indicio grave
2264197 nunca he abandonado a mi esposo cuando me avisaron que hab a sido detenido estaba con mis nietos fuera de santa cruz por el fin de semana los abogados aconsejaron que me quedara en el campo y reci n hoy me autorizaron a volver
2264198 este fue un pedido de los gobernadores del nea que llev el gobernador capitanich del chaco a la presidenta y la alternativa del financiamiento nacional fue evaluada en planificaci n revisando las trazas de los gasoductos secundarios que llegar n a corrientes ober posadas y formosa
2264199 la propuesta contradice el principio econ mico en el que se establece que la generaci n el ctrica debe tomar en cuenta el m nimo costo es decir las que incluyen los recursos m s baratos como son aquellas que trabajan a base de agua
2264200 es una cantinfleada que nadie comprende de d nde sali no se puede manosear a una instituci n como el tribunal constitucional
2264201 y ha cometido un delito de prevaricato es tan evidente que cuando intentamos entender declara y hemos escuchado una y otra vez su declaraci n a lo nico que nos recuerda es a mario moreno cantinflas es una cantinfleada que nadie comprende de d nde sali
2264202 queremos ser categ ricos y contundentes el referendo revocatorio est amparado por una ley de la rep blica totalmente constitucional y legal y no existe procedimiento para pararlo
2264203 muchos se dedican a la tala de forma ilegal porque no hay otra opci n la cosecha de la casta a es temporal da solamente tres veces al a o y luego no hay trabajo por varios meses la madera es la opci n
2264204 cu ntos puestos policiales hay desde i apari hasta puerto maldonado diez controles nunca revisan a los grandes madereros pero s lo hacen a los autos particulares que provienen de puerto maldonado tratan mal a los pasajeros pero no a los camiones que transportan la madera
2264205 detr s de la indiferencia y la lentitud para aplicar la ley hay muchos intereses de madereros ilegales
2264206 desde 2006 detectamos que madereros ilegales tratan de penetrar en la reserva desde la localidad de puerto azul por el sur y por el r o las piedras al norte
2264207 la mafia es compleja y se extiende desde los niveles m s bajos hasta los m s altos sin ning n control madre de dios es la capital de la ilegalidad
2264208 los grandes grupos dijeron no a las concesiones no les conven a y se rebelaron en junio de 2002 estallaron protestas en puerto maldonado en contra de las concesiones forestales lograron que se renegociaran en lima y obtuvieron algunas modificaciones ventajosas
2264209 al final fue una traici n del gran maderero al peque o maderero porque solamente pod an acceder a las concesiones quienes ten an recursos y capital es decir los poderosos
2264210 toda la amazon a de la provincia del tahuamanu se est quedando en manos de unos pocos se ores de la madera la empresa m s grande se est quedando con todo
2264211 si no se fortalece a inrena o se constituye un equipo especial anti tala es obvio que la actividad ilegal de la madera continuar
2264212 no hay forma de saber si las maderas extra das y registradas en los controles de inrena son legales de ese modo las mafias tienen un amplio margen de actuaci n con la complicidad de los grandes
2264213 m s all de este debate con esta decisi n el sistema pol tico s lo ha logrado devaluarse a n m s de lo que estaba al transferir al soberano la responsabilidad de solucionar la profunda crisis nacional
2264214 en definitiva queda la sensaci n de que oficialistas y opositores actuaron sin plena conciencia de sus actos quiz con mezquindad para ganar tiempo con miras al futuro panorama electoral y lo hicieron a sabiendas de que en este momento no existe un rgano rector electoral confiable y menos una instituci n que vele por el respeto de la constitucionalidad debido a la falta de magistrados del tribunal constitucional
2264215 en ltima instancia las reglas del juego no est n nada claras y de principio el discutido revocatorio comienza con mal pie
2264216 en esa agenda no aparece un tema que hoy por hoy convendr a incluir antes de que en lugar de un acuerdo se concrete un gran error nacional el refer ndum revocatorio cada vez m s oficialistas y opositores coinciden en que la consulta no resolver la crisis
2264217 tambi n se debe reconocer plenamente el refer ndum del estatuto auton mico de santa cruz cuya legalidad est en entredicho pero nadie puede desconocer su legitimidad
2264218 esto significar a un gran acuerdo entre oficialistas y opositores tras lo cual no se justificar a el refer ndum revocatorio una vez m s queda en evidencia que esa consulta no beneficia a la poblaci n y podr a evitarse con un di logo serio y responsable pensando en el bienestar general y no en el de los partidos
2264219 la imagen de evo en el exterior lleva el sello de ch vez
2264220 en cuanto a las perspectivas que tendr a el refer ndum revocatorio aparte del vicio constitucional antes apuntado no resolver los problemas pol ticos del pa s m s bien los agravar adem s de inicio el oficialismo ha planteado la consulta con una pregunta incongruente nada clara y finalmente tramposa
2264221 la campa a pol tica por el famoso revocatorio se anuncia justo cuando la corte nacional electoral atraviesa por una grave crisis admitida por su propio presidente y cuando el gobierno nacional y su partido el mas desconf an de las cortes departamentales nunca es tarde para enmendar los errores los l deres del pa s oficialistas y opositores deben hacer todo lo posible por anular este refer ndum que nada bueno dejar a los bolivianos
2264222 bolivia gasta 100 millones de bolivianos en ola de refer ndums
2264223 antes de llegar a semejante desquiciamiento legal el revocatorio lo procedente es aprobar una nueva cpe en consenso a trav s de la aplicaci n de los dos tercios de votos ya sea en una nueva asamblea constituyente tras el fracaso de la ltima o en el congreso nacional
2264224 con una cne desprestigiada como nunca antes en las ltimas d cadas que se reconoce adem s en crisis se pretende llevar adelante un refer ndum revocatorio el 10 de agosto
2264225 el refer ndum revocatorio que ha sido convocado para el mes de agosto y curiosamente aprobado por un senado opositor es algo que se puede calificar cuando menos como riesgoso el refer ndum no ayudar a resolver la crisis pol tica al contrario probablemente la profundice
2264226 3 de 5 prefectos opositores a evo aceptan ir al revocatorio
2264227 reyes villa se queda solo con la oposici n al revocatorio
2264228 dudas sobre el revocatorio llegan a la ue y la oea
2264229 el refer ndum al margen de haber despertado las acostumbradas pasiones pol ticas que suelen anteceder a unas elecciones gener reacciones diversas incluso en el exterior la uni n europea ha decidido no enviar veedores no ser una auditor a y s lo tomar en cuenta las dobles inscripciones las depuraciones y el crecimiento del padr n no habr cruce de datos con lo cual dif cilmente se podr n solucionar las supuestas irregularidades existentes as mientras el revocatorio va de mal en peor la legalidad por un lado y el castigo a la urbanidad por el otro pagan las consecuencias
2264230 descontando las conjeturas el oficialismo de antemano corre con ventaja para el refer ndum revocatorio del 10 de agosto las dos preguntas sobre las que deber n pronunciarse los ciudadanos bolivianos est n claramente direccionadas con el prop sito de asegurar la continuidad del presidente y del vicepresidente de la rep blica
2264231 en las ltimas jornadas sali al descubierto la realidad de que el revocatorio se basar en una maquinaria electoral poco confiable se han percibido graves irregularidades en la entrega de carnets de identidad duplicados o multiplicados
2264232 en la ltima semana ha salido a la luz p blica una variopinta gama de elementos que aliment la p rdida de confianza de la ciudadan a en el padr n electoral cuando esto ocurre no hay explicaciones ni razonamientos que puedan recomponer una situaci n ilegal como la del refer ndum revocatorio punto extremo que adem s se presta a probables apelaciones ante la justicia ordinaria o el tribunal constitucional con el fin de invalidar los resultados de esa consulta prevista para el domingo 10 de agosto
2264233 y por ltimo fruto de tanta irresponsabilidad junta s lo ahonda las diferencias en un pa s peligrosamente polarizado hoy con riesgo de enfrentamientos de consecuencias imprevisibles
2264234 alt simo poder explosivo y por lo tanto destructor de la nacionalidad
2264235 resolvemos exigir al presidente evo morales ayma como jefe del partido de gobierno la convocatoria inmediata a un refer ndum nacional para que la voluntad soberana de todo el pueblo boliviano decida la sede de los poderes del estado boliviano en caso de que eso no ocurra hasta el 11 de agosto comenzaremos la iniciativa ciudadana
2264236 asumir un acto de grandeza desechando la realizaci n del referendo de alt simo poder explosivo y por tanto destructor de la nacionalidad
2264237 este refer ndum no genera empleos no baja los precios de los productos de la canasta familiar no otorga autonom a a los departamentos que decidieron ser aut nomos
2264238 el objetivo de conducir al pa s al desastre y a los bolivianos a la confrontaci n
2264239 la reforma agraria avanza en el gabinete pero el gobierno no nos acompa a en el campo
2264240 han ido entrando de una en una a su tierra cuando se esperaba que los fueran a posesionar la polic a y las fuerzas armadas como ocurri el a o pasado en pueblos unidos
2264241 no ha hecho absolutamente nada simplemente retrocede est en la espera permanente
2264242 se est n larvando situaciones en bolivia que en el mediano o largo plazo ojal no sea a corto pueden desembocar en situaciones muy conflictivas si no se les pone soluci n y uno de los sectores donde puede manifestarse esta conmoci n terrible ser a en el sector agrario
2264243 las leyes se cumplen hasta donde los hombres lo permiten
2264244 para la defensa del sector pecuario y el desarrollo de una estrategia especial contra el nuevo reglamento de tierras
2264245 no van a cambiar porque lo pidamos se debe usar otras estrategias de lucha
2264246 para que no permitan el ingreso de los personeros del inra
2264247 los productores agr colas y ganaderos de los valles sanearemos nuestras propiedades con el instituto departamental de tierras que crear el gobierno departamental aut nomo de santa cruz
2264248 no ha tocado los intereses de los grandes latifundistas sino s lo ha distribuido tierras fiscales
2264249 haber entregado unos 20 millones de hect reas a ind genas y campesinos es algo que no se puede desconocer
2264250 ponerle l mites al latifundio productivo es algo que no se va a poder hacer en el corto plazo es una acci n que requerir del largo plazo y de una correlaci n de fuerzas que deber construirse
2264251 en esto juegan un papel fundamental las organizaciones sociales ind genas y campesinas que con sus movilizaciones han logrado empujar a que los gobiernos les tengan que regularizar la tierra que ya est en su poder
2264252 este tipo de consulta popular es nuevo en bolivia y creemos que va a demostrar quien se apega m s al veredicto popular y quien satisface mejor las expectativas de la poblaci n
2264253 naturalmente creemos que ese referendo va a ser ganado por el presidente morales no queremos pecar de triunfalistas pero es seguro que la poblaci n desea que contin en las reformas en el pa s
2264254 muchos no aceptan que un ind gena sea el presidente de la rep blica y ese racismo oculto que hay en la sociedad puede estarse expresando as
2264255 es verdad que como representante de los pueblos ind genas y de los movimientos sociales el presidente quiere cambiar la inequidad una caracter stica que es propia de casi todas las naciones sudamericanas
2264256 el pueblo dir si sigue el cambio o vuelve el modelo neoliberal
2264257 no se puede manosear a una instituci n como el tribunal constitucional
2264258 queremos ser categ ricos y contundentes el referendo revocatorio est amparado por una ley de la rep blica totalmente constitucional y legal y no existe procedimiento para pararlo
2264259 la corte nacional electoral debe inhibirse de continuar con los actos organizativos del referendo revocatorio hasta que el tribunal constitucional se pronuncie sobre si la demanda de inconstitucionalidad es procedente o no
2264260 no le ha temblado el pulso es una persona que est sacando de la incertidumbre al pueblo de bolivia
2264261 en consecuencia se comunica a la corte electoral que no puede continuar con el referendo hasta que el tribunal constitucional se pronuncie sobre la inconstitucionalidad o no
2264262 lo nico que he hecho es emitir un decreto donde se recogi toda la jurisprudencia del tribunal constitucional en casos similares lo que puedo decir es que no deben seguir los referendos hasta que el tribunal constitucional se pronuncie
2264263 el tribunal constitucional de acuerdo a la constituci n pol tica del estado funciona con un qu rum m nimo de tres miembros
2264264 est amparado por una ley dictada por el congreso y sancionada por el ejecutivo y por tanto plenamente vigente que s lo puede ser frenada por otra ley

2264277 por todo aquello ning n funcionario de la embajada de los estados unidos mucho menos de la casa blanca puede venir a reunirse directamente con umopar y alcaldes
2264278 bolivia es un pa s soberano y cualquier visita de funcionarios extranjeros necesariamente tiene que pasar por gestiones ante el gobierno nacional o la canciller a de la rep blica
2264279 ese di logo tiene que ser en base al respeto entre los pa ses y ning n representante puede hacer su propia agenda si eso no es conocido por las autoridades nacionales
2264280 no somos partidarios de romper relaciones con nadie pero tambi n queremos que sean respetuosos con bolivia

2264309 you really dont know whats in a banks or insurance companys portfolio until after the fact
2264310 in markets that are very strong and are running very rapidly we likely will tend to lag
2264311 that will allow them to do well regardless of whats going on in the environment around them
2264312 were really trying to understand what makes the company tick in more detail than what you could get from a phone call
2264313 when he left i was surprised because he was very well respected at the company and we thought very highly of him
2264314 so i called him up and tried to understand what it was that he saw at rsc
2264315 we all went through bumpy times in our own ways sure we are going to make mistakes but luckily our close families were there to make sure we didnt fall too hard
2264316 we all had to figure out our lives after the craziness of new kids ended

2264338 i worked for 44 hours cleaning up hurricane damage in harlingen and south padre island
2264339 i worked long hours and paid for my own gas and now im getting nothing
2264340 as soon as we found out about these problems we immediately began to look into what the state could do to help
2264341 unfortunately what we have found is a maze of companies and subsidiaries and preliminary indications that the company may be unlicensed
2264342 for the most part if the company is going to stay in business at all weve been pretty fortunate in being able to keep those stores here
2264343 we got caught in a problem that wasnt caused by our economy or what was happening here its part of that globalization of the world
2264344 with everything else thats buffeting the economy right now with the subprime market and gas prices going up the retail consumer is getting hit fairly hard
2264345 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
2264346 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2264347 theres about eight guys in the world who can win that gold medal
2264348 he just has to go out and execute and do his job hes ready
2264349 it wasnt until i went to one of those national selection matches and found i had a serious talent for international skeet and really started shooting that in 2005 that this olympic dream really came forward
2264350 i had a realization at those matches in 2005 that i had the ability and talent to pursue this
2264351 after the last shot i took and broke the last target i knew i made it my eyes were filled with tears and i was full of joy that i got over the rollercoaster that were the olympic trials
2264352 hes shooting around 200 rounds a day hes shooting lights out right now hes really pumped up
2264353 his scores every day on 150 to 200 targets hes only dropping one or two targets
2264354 ive been shooting the last two months and i definitely expect to medal thats a goal
2264355 my confidence is very high going into this ive been training really really hard the last three months and i believe all the hard work is going to pay off
2264356 i dont want to over dramatize the impact the summer league had on us
2264357 had a really good summer league and it helped his confidence added some chemistry to our roster but frankly the majority of the players who were with us in the summer league last year werent around to help us for the most part
2264358 summer league is all about getting a chance and thats all these guys can ask for
2264359 they want to have the opportunity to put their foot in the door
2264360 the main thing is that no one has a guarantee if i was on the summer league roster id feel good knowing theres a level playing field
2264361 although there are still many definitions of infovis floating around i think we have begun to converge on the answer that the dividing line is whether the spatialization is given or chosen
2264362 the central design problem of an infovis system is the choice of how to assign spatial position which is by far the strongest of the perceptual cues our grappling with this huge space of possibilities has led to a strong emphasis on abstraction visual metaphors design principles and evaluation
2264363 in the light of the recent abductions of xxxxx do you think that paedophiles should be given mandatory life sentences
2264364 the current view of course is that visualization systems should be designed in a way that is useful to domain experts with little to no knowledge of visualization in reality of course these are not the actual users of visualizations rather the tools are run by their developers in communication with the domain experts

2264369 another major case in this vein was the slaughter again involving gruesome stabbings and mutilations of a coptic christian family including two young daughters in new jersey in january of 2005 a family whose father and one daughter had received death threats from muslims both via the internet and in person the muslim angle of this case was and remains virtually non existent in the press
2264370 sylvia one of the young daughters was especially brutalized apparently due to the tattoo of a coptic cross on her wrist the girls throat was not only slit but she was stabbed repeatedly in the chest and wrist where she bore the sign of her faith
2264371 a family member who viewed photos of the bloodbath said sylvia seemed to have taken the most savage punishment
2264372 when we saw the pictures you could tell that they were hurt really really bad in the face especially sylvia
2264373 the heartless killer not only slit sylvias throat but also sliced a huge gash in her chest and stabbed her in the wrist where she had a tattoo of a coptic cross

2264379 the data show there are almost three speaking males for every one female and more than four white speaking characters for every one nonwhite character

2264388 everybody just thinks im some guy out here thats punch drunk running around
2264389 i wouldnt be here if it was going to be a problem
2264390 trust me theres no difference between 12 and 13 years to me i could have retired and did all that
2264391 he makes me practice harder definitely running around trying to keep up with him
2264392 even though this is his 13th year in the league he hasnt slowed down a bit
2264393 but its still football youve just got to run and tackle the guy with the ball
2264394 if i can knock down an o lineman knock down some running backs hell definitely tackle whoever has the ball
2264395 im serious when you take on big guys like 353 pound offensive guard leonard davis and all that

2264397 dear diary today i visited my kitty litter box then i took a nap never made it to the cat park
2264398 excuse me belle this is not a scratch and sniff book this is a diary
2264399 the only thing i can say is im happy to stay in l a im happy to stay with the lakers that was my first option it would be hard to leave
2264400 he was offered more you have to look at the taxes
2264401 the opportunity there was more lucrative his heart was here throughout all the conversations he made it clear if there was a way to get a fair deal here thats what he wanted
2264402 im glad it worked out and im looking forward to next season
2264403 now i can clear my mind a little bit i know where im going to be for the next three years its great
2264404 im a gym rat im in the gym all the time next year i want to be better than i was in the previous season thats my goal
2264405 theyve never really measured up financially in the last two or three weeks there have been some significant signings im sure it was a real option
2264406 kobe bryant called me the first day and the last day
2264407 i think if we were to start out the season with this team we would be very happy
2264408 we only have 11 players under contract if there are many minutes left in the frontcourt would get those minutes with sasha back we have four players in the backcourt we can trust we look to fill out the roster
2264409 there are emotional ties with ronny that go beyond basketball
2264410 i think that makes it difficult i think organizations that draft players who turn out to be good players its hard for them to let go of those players and if you know ronny you know hes a special kid
2264411 we will miss ronny we will miss his contributions on and off the court the emotion and the energy he brought whether hes playing or not
2264412 it was a very emotional meeting because he loves the city he loves the organization there are certain bonds here
2264413 he feels its in his best interests to move on the last thing you want is a young player like ronny no matter what hes being paid is being on the bench at 25 years old and not playing
2264414 we discussed it yesterday he wants to play and sees an opportunity to play in golden state at least twofold what he can play here
2264415 if you can have a good time with someone youre supposed to be enemies with and you guys can work together things can be better for your future
2264416 he had a wonderful year this year and i hope that he continues to develop and work which he will
2264417 i want to see american swimmer michael phelps for sure i want to see him do his thing

2264431 there is little comfort to be gained from the mandatory prison sentence especially as it affects mr donaghys children and their mother but hopefully the healing process can begin in earnest for all
2264432 by having this nonpublic information i was in a unique position to predict the outcome of nba games
2264433 he told it all the good the bad and the ugly
2264434 he had to do it because it was the right thing to do the bottom line is that mr donaghy has been a model cooperator

2264442 hay una conjura para evitar que bolivia vaya a las urnas
2264443 de acuerdo a la constituci n y las leyes bolivianas el pronunciamiento de una sola vocal del tc no tiene ning n efecto en el escenario legal
2264444 el referendo ha sido convocado por una ley aprobada por el congreso por lo tanto s lo otra ley puede revocar esta consulta es m s la corte nacional electoral cne emiti una resoluci n en el sentido de que en nada afecta el pronunciamiento del tc por lo tanto seguir caminando la realizaci n de la consulta
2264445 en bolivia no hay tribunal constitucional porque no hay miembros para hacerlo funcionar ahora queda una sola magistrada que encima era suplente
2264446 en este marco hay un proceso de refer ndum revocatorio que no tiene base legal porque esta figura no existe en la constituci n actual todo se ampara en el vac o legal que existe hoy en bolivia
2264447 la situaci n actual es la prueba del grado de desinstitucionalizaci n que est viviendo bolivia y c mo las instancias jur dicas toman decisiones pol micas sujetas a debate el refer ndum revocatorio pierde legitimidad los resultados que tenga independientemente de qui n gane o pierda ser n cuestionados
2264448 el refer ndum revocatorio tiene problemas de constitucionalidad de pertinencia problemas pol ticos jur dicos y tambi n log sticos
2264449 usted est de acuerdo con la continuidad del proceso de cambio liderado por el presidente evo morales ayma
2264450 usted est de acuerdo con la continuidad de las pol ticas las acciones y la gesti n del prefecto del departamento
2264451 el refer ndum es probablemente el acto pol tico m s insano de los ltimos a os m s all del resultado volver a mostrar una bolivia dividida pero eso no es ninguna novedad ser como sacarle una nueva foto a un mismo objeto pero de un diferente ngulo el problema seguir los bolivianos estar n m s divididos habr m s confrontaci n
2264452 estoy haciendo respetar la jurisprudencia cuando se presenta un recurso el rgano que va a aplicar la norma impugnada debe suspenderla hasta que el tribunal se pronuncie

2264454 el tribunal no tendr qu rum para dictar resoluciones pero si tiene atribuciones para hacer respetar la institucionalidad

2264463 maximizaron las medidas de seguridad del presidente para que pueda continuar con su gira de campa a para el referendo revocatorio a efectuarse en agosto
2264464 evo morales ha planteado a estados unidos que deje de conspirar pol ticamente en bolivia y ha planteado conspirar contra la pobreza la exclusi n social y la desigualdad
2264465 yo creo realmente en crear un ambiente de mejor confianza de mejor cooperaci n y colaboraci n y terminamos acordando que la nica conspiraci n que va a existir en nuestras relaciones bilaterales va a ser la conspiraci n contra la pobreza contra la desigualdad y la exclusi n social
2264466 vamos a asegurar que en las relaciones bilaterales haya la transparencia necesaria en nuestros programas como la agencia internacional de desarrollo de ee uu usaid y tambi n en la manera en que hablamos y cooperamos con el gobierno de bolivia para asegurar que ese tipo de preocupaci n o acusaci n no surja en el futuro
2264467 no estamos en contra de que vengan estudiantes y delegaciones de estados unidos para intercambiar experiencias a bolivia le interesa el intercambio cultural con estados unidos

2264482 in the information society development libraries are central as they are open for all access points for printed and increasingly electronic materials
2264483 finelib was launched to support higher education learning and research in finland as part of the information society programme
2264484 until now the emphasis has been more on technical advancement creating new solutions and options for the end users and partner libraries rather than on contributing to the knowledge society in the broadest sense
2264485 the publishers were less interested in the project than we had expected
2264486 ebooks seem to develop to a natural medium both in public and academic libraries
2264487 finelib should initiate pr campaigns in order to promote the use of electronic materials
2264488 there should be a vision of public broadband access to finelib material for every citizen
2264489 the challenge of new literacies should be elaborated in a national media education programme also to promote information literacy supported by electronic library services

2264496 in many respects so much better than the civilized world
2264497 all winter long i have had the threads of this tissue in my hands and have searched for the ultimate pattern and though it has become a tissue of rough coarse aspect nevertheless the threads have been chosen carefully and according to certain rules and it might prove to be a real peasant picture i know it is
2264498 i personally am convinced that i get better results by painting them in their roughness than by giving them a conventional charm it would be wrong i think to give a peasant picture a certain conventional smoothness if a peasant picture smells of bacon smoke potato steam all right thats not unhealthy if a stable smells of dung all right that belongs to a stable if the field has an odor of ripe corn or potatoes or of guano or manure thats healthy especially for city people such pictures may teach them something but to be perfumed is not what a peasant picture needs
2264499 tell serret that i should be desperate if my figures were correct tell him that i do not want them to be academically correct tell him that my great longing is to learn to make those very incorrectnesses those deviations remodelings changes in reality so that they may become yes lies if you like but truer than the literal truth

2264675 no habr coca cero pero tampoco libre cultivo de coca
2264676 una crisis econ mica sumada a la crisis pol tica podr a ser letal para el gobierno
2264677 si hay problemas hay que demostrarlo se ve la naturaleza del problemas y se ve el efecto que tiene siempre hay problemas pero el problema es saber si ese algo invalida el sentido general de la elecci n
2264678 este arresto es totalmente ilegal y peligroso para m me han tratado como si fuera un delincuente y yo no he cometido ning n delito debido a un acto de prepotencia me han colocado en mi habitaci n del hotel d a y noche polic as para que me vigilen

2264680 este es un tremendo abuso lo peor que le puede ocurrir a un ciudadano es verse despojado de su identidad
2264681 me parece un disparate tratar de retenerme con polic as cuando tengo todos mis documentos en regla adem s estoy siendo sometido a un tratamiento de salud en un centro geri trico y me siento de maravilla esto sinceramente es un atropello

2264685 la intromisi n de mis hijos en mi vida si me pasa algo los nicos responsables ser n ellos quienes han recurrido a fuerzas internacionales para adue arse de mis bienes y de mi persona
2264686 mi madre est mucho mejor de salud sufri un golpe en la cadera hace algunas semanas ella sali de fin de semana con mis hijos sin pensar lo que pasar a mientras la situaci n persista ella permanecer en las afueras de la ciudad
2264687 la justicia de bolivia podr a entregar la tutela a sus hijos y ellos regresar an al per de inmediato con su padre
2264688 el se or tudela est pr cticamente detenido en su casa en bolivia no puede moverse sufre la presencia de un polic a dentro de su casa es una paradoja una cosa de locos l es un hombre libre que no ha cometido ning n delito que est casado con su se ora conforme a las leyes peruanas viven juntos y pueden mudarse a donde les d la gana
2264689 el juez orden su internamiento en el hospital de santa cruz en el rea de geriatr a y lo puso a resguardo de la fiscal a porque al momento de ser encontrado estaba abandonado pues su esposa no se encontraba con l

2264692 junto al hecho de que las materias primas energ ticas m s importantes alcanzan m ximos durante la segunda mitad de 2007 el foco principal de tensiones inflacionistas ha sido el incremento de los precios agr colas
2264693 especialmente a partir de la segunda mitad de 2007 la inflaci n agr cola se ha traducido en un repunte de los precios de alimentos que ha resultado especialmente intenso en am rica latina sobre todo si la comparamos con los mercados desarrollados no es de extra ar por tanto que los precios de alimentos hayan contaminado a los ndices generales de inflaci n
2264694 el crecimiento de la demanda super el de la oferta de muchos de estos productos sobre todo en el caso de los principales cereales y los aceites comestibles eso ha reducido las existencias mundiales de estos cultivos a niveles que no se registraban desde mediados de los a os setenta
2264695 el aumento galopante de los precios de las materias primas un nivel de crecimiento superior a la tendencia y pol ticas macroecon micas acomodaticias
2264696 los pron sticos de inflaci n para estas econom as analizadas en conjunto muestran un alza de 1 5 puntos porcentuales en 2008 y 2009 es decir tasas de 9 1 y 7 4 respectivamente
2264697 algunos gobiernos han optado por introducir medidas de control directo de los precios en algunas industrias sin demasiado xito en venezuela el caso m s paradigm tico la adopci n de este tipo de medidas ha derivado en un estrangulamiento de los beneficios empresariales en los sectores afectados lo que a su vez redunda en una menor oferta y en muchos casos en desabastecimiento
2264698 en colombia el acuerdo entre gobierno y cadenas de supermercados para limitar el crecimiento de los precios tampoco ha tenido resultados positivos
2264699 que el petr leo caro ha jugado un papel clave en esta nueva coyuntura inflacionaria pero tambi n lo han sido las actuaciones equivocadas de los bancos centrales al subir sus tasas de inter s como f rmula para atajar el alza en los precios
2264700 estamos llegando a lo que se conoce con el feo nombre de estanflaci n es decir un estancamiento econ mico acompa ado de altos ndices de inflaci n
2264701 aqu el problema es que hay una oferta insuficiente de comida ya que muchas tierras se est n dedicando a la siembra de productos para fabricar biocombustibles a base de oleaginosas ma z y ca a para sustituir el petr leo eso merm la oferta de alimentos frente a la excesiva demanda asi tica
2264702 esa pol tica se volvi en contra de los mismos estadounidenses ya que su inflaci n anual lleg al 5 en momentos en que la recesi n los afecta y la devaluaci n del d lar ha propiciado el alza en los precios del petr leo
2264703 nuestras econom as son m s pobres de all que el impacto de los alimentos sea alto en la canasta familiar
2264704 aunque la meta de inflaci n en colombia para este a o ya se perdi por un punto no es una situaci n grave o para rasgarse las vestiduras tampoco es para entrar en p nico
2264705 en am rica latina y colombia la inflaci n en alimentos es la mitad de lo que ha pasado en otros pa ses pero las presiones alcistas seguir n por cuenta de los insumos y los fertilizantes
2264706 al fuerte aumento que volvieron a experimentar los gastos financieros
2264707 en reas como banca telecomunicaciones infraestructuras o energ as renovables uno de los sectores m s interesantes
2264708 habr que esperar un largo proceso pues los convenios deben ser ratificados por las c maras de los dos pa ses firmantes
2264709 acabar n de tejer la tupida red del rea latinoamericana en la que espa a ya mantiene cdi con argentina brasil bolivia cuba ecuador m xico y venezuela
2264710 es esencial para promover las inversiones exteriores bien sean extranjeras en espa a o de capital espa ol en el exterior
2264711 no me asusta la crisis y vamos a lograr crecimientos de dos d gitos
2264712 nos gusta el nombramiento mar a es menos estratega que rosa que ven a de ser la mano derecha de steve ballmer gara a viene del negocio
2264713 estim que el aprovechamiento de los 1 000 litros de agua por segundo otorgados afectar a los bofedales de la zona pese a la mitigaci n por riego que propuso la empresa
2264714 hay mineral hay inversi n y hay mercado lo que no hay es agua
2264715 extraer agua de un pozo cuesta en promedio unos us 0 5 a us 0 6 por cada m3 por segundo y desalinizar cuesta unos us 1 6 por cada m3
2264716 hay que aclarar muy bien ese tema porque una cosa es que permitamos cierta actividad extranjera en territorio chileno y otra muy distinta es que cedamos lo que es nuestro yo por lo menos estoy dispuesto a hablar de lo primero pero de lo otro soberan a no
2264717 ellos podr an hacer inversiones y obtener beneficios por un tiempo determinado con total independencia como si se tratara de una concesi n eso yo lo apoyo y as lo he planteado con mucha fuerza cada vez que surge este tema y a cambio podr amos ver la manera en que bolivia nos ayuda a enfrentar nuestro problema energ tico con sus reservas de gas
2264718 por lo que le parece ser que cantero propone una especie de permuta de terrenos y no me queda claro el contexto en que sta se producir a es decir si estamos entregando soberan a sobre una parte de nuestro territorio cosa que desde ya no comparto
2264719 podr amos imitar un modelo como el de la uni n europea donde las personas los productos y capitales circulan libremente e incluso hay una legislaci n com n creo que por ah va la cosa porque as tendr amos un intercambio m s fluido y una relaci n comercial que enriquecer a tanto a chile como a bolivia
2264720 todo esto en el marco de un tratado que una a chile y bolivia en una alianza estrat gica para hacer viable un emprendimiento de alto valor comercial social y cultural que est llamado a configurar una nueva geograf a econ mica generando nuevos espacios de influencia hinterland a los puertos mar timos y fluviales de una potente cuenca geoecon mica que alcanza al sur de brasil paraguay norte de argentina bolivia y chile permitiendo a este bloque acceder e influir en inmensos mercados
2264721 son muchos a os sin soluci n a esa leg tima aspiraci n
2264722 ya que mientras en bolivia se ha mantenido la idea de recuperar un litoral cautivo ileg timamente en chile se ha consolidado la idea de un territorio nacional incuestionable
2264723 tengan configurado un mapa mental dicot mico que nunca llevar a ning n destino positivo un juego de suma cero
2264724 para que juntos podamos insertarnos en los mercados globales usando la potente plataforma litoral y portuaria de la ribera del oc ano pac fico su proyecci n hacia los emergentes mercados asi ticos intercambiando recursos b sicos construyendo sistemas de transporte intermodal que eficienten nuestra conectividad accesibilidad mejorando la proximidad y centralidad que integre nuestros sistemas financieros y permita la integraci n y complementaci n empresarial para penetrar juntos los m s diversos mercados del mundo
2264725 los nuevos tiempos demandan dejar atr s las divisiones que nos mantienen anclados en el pasado los lastres que obstaculizan nuevas miradas para construir un futuro de prosperidad com n
2264726 no vislumbro agreg razones que puedan impedir un esfuerzo de integraci n y complementaci n como ste que se basa en la confianza y colaboraci n mutua con un sentido de fraternidad que debe ser asumido como una pol tica de estado en ambas naciones
2264727 estamos ante un escenario lleno de oportunidades que exigen nuevas miradas sentido prospectivo proactivo y visionario
2264728 las cifras muestran el constante crecimiento dado que iquique se ha transformado en su canal de abastecimiento
2264729 el comercio bilateral no llega ni a la mitad de lo que mueve zofri tan s lo entre enero y mayo de este a o llevamos us 341 millones que es un 24 m s que en igual per odo del a o pasado
2264730 el perfil del comerciante boliviano indica que realiza compras no muy grandes pero que viene varias veces en el a o y el volumen de negocios que generan es muy alto
2264731 su implementaci n generar una nueva din mica de negocios que beneficiar a todos
2264732 la pretensi n que las mercanc as pudieran ser nacionalizadas e ingresadas a libre tr nsito para ser reexportadas a bolivia va contra todos los principios del tratado de 1904 ya que solamente se permite el libre tr nsito a mercader as provenientes de ultramar a su vez las normas que permiten redestinar una mercanc a en libre tr nsito y que existen desde el a o 1953 en ning n caso perjudicar n a la zona franca ya que por el contrario permitir n que mercanc as en libre tr nsito ingresen por cambio en la decisi n comercial del propietario a la zona franca para su comercializaci n incrementando as el movimiento y la competencia
2264733 es cierto que su planteo es bastante elemental tiene cosas que visualmente son fascinantes la fuerza a rea estaba en pa ales y ste se sube a un avi n y filma desde el aire usa mapas para ubicar al espectador en la acci n como se hace en los documentales contempor neos y le mete cosas de humor rar simas el soldado m s petiso de la guerra del paraguay el mono tit que usan de mascota para volar cosas que no tienen nada que ver con el tono necesariamente dram tico que tiene un documental que habla de la guerra pero que tambi n transmite un poco de la cotidianidad de los soldados con los que vivi funes que se pas tres meses ah es una rareza desde cualquier punto de vista porque es un conflicto que ha quedado inexplicablemente olvidado en la historia del siglo xx pese al desastre humano que produjo y por otro lado siempre es un largo mudo argentino m s quedan muy pocos apenas 10 o 12 de los m s de 200 largos mudos que se filmaron
2264734 la diferencia es que es la nica que se ha hecho p blica
2264735 nosotros vemos de manera auspiciosa que la empresa est participando activamente en un proyecto y emprendimiento de esta magnitud
2264736 lo que ha se alado el presidente evo morales en m s de una ocasi n que no est en los planes inmediatos imponer una medida como sa de nacionalizaci n de los ferrocarriles
2264737 se pretende realizar una evaluaci n de los compromisos del contrato de concesi n de las inversiones realizadas
2264738 no hay por lo menos en la superintendencia de transportes alg n indicio sobre alg n incumplimiento lo que se quiere es terminar de formar certidumbre habida cuenta de que en los ltimos meses se ha manifestado por parte de grupos sociales que en m s de una ocasi n han exigido que el gobierno disponga la reversi n de los ferrocarriles
2264739 no en absoluto yo creo que hay que descartar una informaci n que pudiera lanzarse en ese sentido porque adem s de alarmista es inoportuna
2264740 en este desventurado pa s bolivia estamos como ustedes en ecuador en manos de una pandilla de oportunistas radicalizados de la izquierda criog nica que quieren llevarnos de vuelta al neol tico manipulando odios y rencores at vicos para refundar la patria a su gusto y capricho y as reinar sin trabas pisoteando la libertad
2264741 no hay mal que dure cien a os ni cuerpo que lo aguante
2264742 si en bolivia existiera un padr n electoral como deber a ser hubiera ganado las elecciones con un 80 de los votos pero eso va a cambiar porque un gobierno amigo va a financiar una campa a para que todos los ind genas se inscriban en el registro electoral
2264743 las evidencias cada vez m s claras y contundentes del manejo discrecional del padr n electoral con depuraciones inexplicables la extensi n de certificados de nacimiento a diestra y siniestra por autoridades gubernamentales que en complicidad vergonzante permiten la intromisi n del gobierno venezolano en la base de datos y la extensi n de carnets de identidad de manera irregular y fraudulenta denotan que el mas y el gobierno est n dispuestos a lograr la ratificaci n presidencial y la revocatoria de los prefectos opositores a cualquier precio as sea a trav s de un monumental fraude electoral que salta a la vista est en curso
2264744 acto de demostraci n operativa no un desfile tradicional sino una actividad donde el pueblo venezolano podr ver qu hace la armada y la fuerza armada nacional

2264861 the ability of white space devices to detect the signals of tv stations and wireless microphones
2264862 their potential for a transmitter operating in tv white space to interfere with tv reception and wireless microphone operations
2264863 we are planning to test at a mostly under controlled conditions with limited tests during a live performance there will not be any transmitter tests

2264892 this is a great club there were others interested but villa is such a big club
2264893 when you speak to a manager you want to get a good feel for what he is trying to do and i did straight away with martin he made me feel wanted
2264894 obviously i spoke to the manager and he is very positive and ambitious

2264900 we have made a big improvement from two years ago to last year
2264901 we want to continue that and we have kept the basis of the team
2264902 i believe the frustration we got from not winning it in the end will be for the best for we have the strength and resolve to do it

2264910 theyre special and theyll always have a place in my heart
2264911 one of the reasons i had the courage to say what i did was the fact that manchester united would be fairly compensated
2264912 the figure mentioned which would have been a world record would be some compensation for the debt of gratitude that i owe the club at least in material terms
2264913 for a while i wanted united to accept the offer and for me to move to madrid
2264914 if i denied it i would be deceiving everyone including myself
2264915 when they turned down the offer the people at united made it very clear how much they wanted me i didnt fully understand it at the time but now i can really appreciate it

2264918 he has been one of the most important people in my playing career not only because of what ive learnt and continue to learn from him in sporting terms but also in human ones as well
2264919 if it were humanly possible i would like to have him always by my side he has been like a second father to me
2264920 i know that no one is harder on me than myself and thats never going to change under any circumstances

2264937 weve only got three weeks and its going to take three weeks
2264938 i came here from green bay and learned this offense fairly quickly the plays are the same they are just called different ways
2264939 it was good to see him come here and support us with everything he has going on
2264940 the first thing that came out of his mouth was lets have a lot of fun
2264941 i have very little to teach him compared to what i am going to soak in listening to him
2264942 its a great opportunity for me i was really looking forward to hopefully playing and doing a lot of things but you dont have the opportunity to learn from a guy thats going to the hall of fame very often
2264943 he started playing in the nfl two years before i started playing pee wees so he has more time in the nfl than i have playing football total

2264964 it was a big mistake it wasnt my fault i pushed the girl in the chest area while she was grabbing for a glass in my hand
2264965 its going to be a big change in his life
2264966 she would come home from school and would immediately take off her braces and crawl around on the floor
2264967 its a pretty unusual wish and i dont think weve had others like it in illinois
2264968 she could have chosen to go to a hannah montana concert or take a trip to disney or something and she would have been happy for a night or one week
2264969 this is something that was going to benefit her forever
2264970 shes made great gains and shes one of those kids who really wanted to stay and do more
2264971 when i started i did not think i could take 100 steps
2264972 she can go on the swing climb up the ladder slide down the slide everything we do

2264990 the hammerschmidt mansion is one of the first impressions visitors receive of our community and not only is it a visual treasure but one of the only remaining queen anne homes along chicago avenue
2264991 it is not simply a residence but a work of art a show piece of a bygone era and a visual focal point for the area
2264992 they have made it public and very much aware out there that they are prepared to sell the property to anybody who is willing to purchase it with landmark status for their purchase price and their closing costs and caring costs
2264993 its unfortunate that a few people are trying to impose their will on someone else the property today is beyond maintenance and it would take close to 1 million to put this property back in a condition that would be acceptable
2264994 anyone that has lived in naperville more than a year or two knows this home if there was ever a landmark home in town this has to be at the top or near it

2265002 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2265003 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2265004 we get support of our president that means a lot that means a lot of people back home want us to succeed
2265005 so we have to go out there and play like were representing the us of a
2265006 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
2265007 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded center contained more globular clusters than those farther away
2265008 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from m87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
2265009 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of m87
2265010 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
2265011 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
2265012 in m87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
2265013 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
2265014 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
2265015 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters center m87 sits at the center of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the center probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
2265016 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time
2265017 penetration levels of humira within each of its six approved uses are still very low

2265021 our main goal is to get the most detailed images and remote sensing data ever of the geologically active features on enceladus
2265022 from this data we may learn more about how eruptions tectonics and seismic activity alter the moons surface we will get an unprecedented high resolution view of the active area immediately following the closest approach
2265023 knowing the sizes of the particles their rates and what else is mixed in these jets can tell us a lot about whats happening inside the little moon
2265024 wed like to refine our numbers and see which fracture or stripe is hotter than the rest because these results can offer evidence one way or the other for the existence of liquid water as the engine that powers the plumes
2265025 sites that infect visiting pcs represent some of the worst of digital pollution
2265026 malware is a global problem that requires cooperation across industries and across national borders
2265027 our goal in releasing this report is not to point fingers or to imply that network owners or governments are at fault for the malware on their networks but rather to start a conversation when different links in the internet chain talk to each other and share information it leads to solutions that in turn lead to a safer internet for all of us
2265028 it prompted ipowerweb to ask for help with support from stopbadware org and data from google the company was able to clean up all those sites and secure its servers against future attacks

2265039 to exploit the dns design to quickly guess the transaction id of an address query and potentially re route the user to an unexpected domain
2265040 while most early discussions focused on web surfing and the potential hijacking of users browser sessions kaminsky today pointed out that dns address queries are embedded in a wide variety of applications and services that had not entered the conversation previously
2265041 they will do a dns lookup for any reason at all and your spam filter will not stop this problem
2265042 back end it systems such as telnet snmp authentication servers such as radius backup and restoral systems and even service oriented architecture soa environments all use dns and could be subject to attack via the newly discovered flaw
2265043 our continued dedication to quality is paying off for consumers and this years vehicle dependability study is further demonstration of the strides we are making
2265044 customers deserve higher levels of quality at the time they buy their vehicle and throughout its lifetime our improving initial quality and long term dependability show that weve responded in a meaningful way for the long term
2265045 perhaps part of the problem is that esbs are becoming more widespread you can practically get one free with every childrens meal these days theyre proliferating like kudzu within the enterprise
2265046 this is the inconvenient truth that enterprise architects run into when designing projects that cross different esb implementations in a corporate it environment
2265047 call me crazy but would it not make more sense to have a centralized plan as to what the soa should be based on the requirements of the business versus people dashing out and shelling out the dollars for an esb for some one off tactical reason or more likely just acting out of reaction to the hype now youre left with a dysfunctional mess thats not easily corrected and clearly costly why the heck are you attempting to integrate these integration engines when they should perhaps be displaced altogether because call me crazy again that would be cheaper
2265048 what im asserting is that there has to be some architecture forethought behind dragging any technology into the enterprise and i suspect thats not occurring
2265049 i completely see his point but i suspect rip and replace may be just too radical for most organizations too difficult to admit mistakes were made too hard to undo all the work youve put into an architecture too expensive to start over
2265050 that the greatest it value of a service based architecture is that it enables these things with them i can be more responsive to business needs faster im also too much of a realist we have to try and refine over time
2265051 so long as the governance and testability are there why preclude any technology from making a contribution especially one that is doing fairly well at the job like esbs
2265052 companies are buying esbs will continue to buy esbs will buy products that are packaged with esbs and will acquire merge with other companies that have esbs they arent going away so yes large companies will have to figure out how to deal with having more than one

2265069 its been a total pleasure to discover the joyous score and great british humor of sixpence the show is so clearly a product of the 1960s when social class distinctions were just beginning to break down in england and theatre music was unabashedly tuneful and brassy it feels huge there are seven production numbers and a whole raft of outlandish characters all based on the great h g wells novel its like stumbling upon another crossed with hello dolly patti colombo is a force of nature her choreography is thrilling and the cast is amazingly talented im in awe of their stamina
2265070 the story of arthur kipps a young man working in a small london shop as a drapers assistant who unexpectedly inherits a fortune as he climbs up the social ladder kipps discovers romance and excitement before losing everything and realizing that although you cant buy happiness true love is priceless
2265071 oh my gosh people are going to want a small lightweight solid state computer
2265072 oh its too weak and its underpowered who wants something like that
2265073 oh my god that is exactly what i want all i want is the smallest thing to carry that does a good job with e mail and web browsing i want this thing
2265074 oh its a lot smaller than i thought it was
2265075 i cant believe how important this instant on feature is i never understood how important it was until i actually had one
2265076 as is usually the case with large scale sit down stage productions the original cast members were signed to a one year contract and some are moving on to new projects
2265077 todd burnsed ensemble dominique roy ensemble and jd aubrey smith swing
2265078 her commitment to philadelphia theatre can be seen in her varied contributions of time and talent to organizations including but not limited to 1812 productions arden theatre company rutgers university temple university university of the arts and the wilma theater
2265079 these collaborations each result in a public event and have an importance or impact both on the participating organizations and the greater philadelphia community
2265080 i know that no one is harder on me than myself and thats never going to change under any circumstances
2265081 what i said publicly which was maybe a little naive i take total responsibility for
2265082 people have to understand one thing at the age of 18 i arrived at a dream club like manchester united
2265083 but even at that moment i was thinking about playing in england for some years and then going to play in spain
2265084 people cant be upset about me fulfilling a childhood dream
2265085 im very aware what this club has done for me
2265086 theyre special and theyll always have a place in my heart
2265087 one of the reasons i had the courage to say what i did was the fact that manchester united would be fairly compensated
2265088 the figure mentioned which would have been a world record would be some compensation for the debt of gratitude that i owe the club at least in material terms
2265089 for a while i wanted united to accept the offer and for me to move to madrid
2265090 if i denied it i would be deceiving everyone including myself
2265091 when they turned down the offer the people at united made it very clear how much they wanted me
2265092 sir alex ferguson was always intransigent and denied any possibility of a transfer
2265093 believe me it makes me proud to know how much he thinks of me
2265094 he has been one of the most important people in my playing career
2265095 if it were humanly possible i would like to have him always by my side he has been like a second father to me
2265096 if one day i leave united i want to do it knowing that i did
2265097 and peruvian food a childrens show dance and other events you can see more detailed information at
2265098 this coming season is the first time this club has been able to look forward in many many years
2265099 last season even though the club had come out of administration was dogged by the 15 points saga
2265100 if you look at the two or three seasons that preceded it leeds spent all their time contending with one huge problem after another
2265101 it put the club in a downward spiral the extent of which i see when i look at some of the photos on the walls
2265102 i was looking at one recently of mark viduka and david batty playing against valencia in the champions league semi final
2265103 it was difficult to believe that game took place only a few years ago it shows just how far the club has fallen
2265104 but i feel we have finally reached a time where the oil tanker has started to turn round
2265105 it is a fresh start for us all and we can feel positive about the future which hasnt always been the case
2265106 this is our second season in this division and that might take away a little bit of what we faced last season because playing leeds will not be such a novelty for our opponents
2265107 i thought i would be back playing inside a few months
2265108 i actually had a couple of reserve games but knew things were not right
2265109 i spent a week in the united states after the op but then came home
2265110 i was laid up in bed seven hours a day and on a machine that kept the knee mobile for a further seven hours
2265111 i could put no weight at all on the knee for six weeks and that was when my mind began to wander and i doubted whether id ever play again
2265112 thankfully that mood lasted only a couple of days before i made up my mind that i was going to give it my best shot
2265113 christianity is a big part of my life and its not just about going to church on a sunday it is with me throughout the whole week
2265114 it was frustrating because i would have loved to be involved
2265115 but i went to both the semi final and final was out there on the pitch before the game with the rest of the lads and soaked up the wembley atmosphere
2265116 because i wasnt playing maybe i could take it all in better than the rest but i would still have preferred to play
2265117 there are exciting times ahead for this club were on the verge of something really good
2265118 a believer sees his sins as if he were sitting under a mountain which he is afraid may fall on him whereas the wicked person considers his sins as flies passing over his nose and he just drives them away like this and he moved his hand over his nose in illustration
2265119 that is why youll love love my carpet hi i am a vacuum cleaner you call tell by the hose
2265120 im a vacuum cleaner you can tell by the hose
2265121 its a new kind of cheerios waiting in your breakfast bowl

2265126 we do not know just how active this mechanism is it might vaporize applications it might simply prevent them from using the gps for all we know it could trigger world war three or it could cause some computer somewhere to spit out recipes for buttermilk pancakes
2265127 you dont do a sequel 27 years later because youve suddenly learned to communicate your feelings
2265128 in reflection of how critical it has become for the us military to retain native language and cultural know how in its ranks
2265129 here we are all of a sudden in the 60th year after strom thurmond bolting the democratic party over a simple thing something almost unheard of because he did not want the armed forces to be integrated
2265130 here we are 45 years after the i have a dream speech forty years after the assassinations of kennedy and king and this party that i have been a part of for so long this party that has been accused of taking black people for granted is about to deliver the nomination for the nations highest office to an african american how do you describe that all those days in jail cells wondering if anything you were doing was even going to have an impact
2265131 but ive got a head too and in the beginning my head was with clinton the conventional wisdom was that this thing was going to be over in february
2265132 youd be real embarrassed if he won and you wasnt down with it
2265133 every kid is always talking about what his parents have been through
2265134 and no kid has any clue what hes talking about
2265135 there was an arrogance and a complete dismissiveness in our campaign against obama that he was a lightweight that he couldnt get black support
2265136 a lot of the black leaders didnt know him didnt think he was black enough didnt think he was of the civil rights movement
2265137 in the context of what i do for a living ive not figured out a black or white way to fill a pothole
2265138 look i never asked anybody to be for me because i was black
2265139 i asked people to be for me because i thought i was the best candidate when i ran for city council and when i ran for mayor im proud of the votes i received im proud i received the votes of the majority of the african american community and the majority of the vote from the white community but i never asked anybody to give me anything because i was black i asked people to give me a chance because i thought i was the best
2265140 its presumptuous it demonstrates a continuation of this notion that the african american community unlike any other is completely monolithic that everyone in the african american community does the same thing in lockstep in contrast to any other group i mean i dont remember seeing john kerry on tv and anybody saying to him i cant believe youre not for hillary clinton why
2265141 the challenge there is never forgetting where you came from
2265142 so yes i am mayor of all philadelphia but i am quite well aware of and raise on a regular basis the fact that the majority of people who are killed in philadelphia are african american that the overwhelming majority of people who have health care challenges are african american that education has tremendous disparity gaps unemployment incarceration poverty homelessness housing all affect the african american community at a disproportionate level as opposed to everyone else
2265143 i realized it like a month ago so ive been excited about it since then
2265144 has been talking about her golden birthday since she could read a calendar
2265145 that we realized that this would be a pretty special day
2265146 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2265147 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2265148 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
2265149 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2265150 what i would like people to feel when they see my art is joy hope happiness and most of all to be able to use simple words to have a discussion about art
2265151 i had the opportunity to personally meet romero where we ended up in a conversation about how to bring his art to people across the country
2265152 i see my work as colorful vibrant and very positive and optimistic about the future
2265153 the first pictures i saw of him when he didnt have any glasses on didnt look anything like him

2265155 we have been informed about the case by the u s authorities and we are checking possible connections to germany at the moment
2265156 there is a pending investigation to determine who this guy is
2265157 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2265158 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2265159 he just thought he was better than anybody else and he could do anything and there was no way to stop him
2265160 he claimed to be a german student and i think he had already finished
2265161 we just figured out everything was not what it was
2265162 hes not in the yearbook theres no record of him theres no footprint of him but he was there
2265163 no no no dont get a job that requires it
2265164 reality only exists in your mind therefore your mind creates your reality

2265231 over the next few weeks all my symptoms cleared up before i could barely walk a mile now i spend weekends on 15 mile hikes with my friends as long as im careful not to do things that cause the problem to recur im completely fine

2265236 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
2265237 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
2265238 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
2265239 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
2265240 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
2265241 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started anew chapter
2265242 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
2265243 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
2265244 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
2265245 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
2265246 the uproar made poor timing for global outreach and the promotional film was temporarily shelved after more than 69 000 people died in the sichuan earthquake in may the broadcast was delayed again
2265247 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
2265248 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese

2265277 im going to be excited a little nervous a little anxious
2265278 i told mike scioscia in there that i was definitely a little nervous tonight because ive played against this team for so long that to be on the other side now is definitely exciting
2265279 ive never made it to the post season in five years of my career this being the sixth season hopefully ill get that shot its kind of one day at a time the old clich and if we do our jobs every day every night well get to where we want to be
2265280 when youre in last place people only talk about the future because the present is basically over
2265281 and this team is talking about the present it doesnt matter what the contract status is of anybody on the team our number one goal is to win ballgames
2265282 those are questions that will be answered after the season
2265283 the most important thing for me is to do my job as an angel tonight and every night that we play at the end of the season well talk about those things
2265284 i dare you to go dance with that old man

2265292 i dont know whats going to happen in the next couple of days and i was just letting the fans know i appreciate them
2265293 i was surprised when i was traded by chicago and it worked out
2265294 so i have no expectations you learn from past experiences ive prepared myself not to be surprised if it does happen
2265295 being able to bring in a player like mark teixeira is something positive and it shows commitment by the management and everyone in the front office
2265296 hes definitely talented and well have to pursue that when the time comes
2265297 right now our goal is to bring a world championship to southern california and being able to add a player like mark teixeira makes it that much better
2265298 we can talk about contracts and there will be plenty of time to do that in the offseason
2265299 i heard a couple of things on espn but i just went about my business it was out of my control i didnt stress on it a whole lot
2265300 im going to green bay for brett favre straight up
2265301 this is so out of our hands and even this year its out of our hands i just think this team needs to take a step past that and focus on playing baseball
2265302 its easy to point a finger that that is the issue so the issue has to change in here
2265303 i dont think were planning on any caped crusader coming in here and saving our asses
2265304 if its oppressive on a daily basis it can wear you down
2265305 if you have a veteran team and it rolls off their back that doesnt necessarily matter but if you have a young team it could have a diminishing returns effect you need to know when to put the foot down and when to back off
2265306 this is the point we could try to romanticize the situation sensationalize it but we dont care what the red sox and yankees do
2265307 that is the right approach to take through all of this well figure out at the end of the year where were at
2265308 we need to focus what weve got at this moment and thats the only place we can be we know the power that lies in the present the better we do that the better were going to be down the stretch thats what we were doing earlier this year we werent chasing pennants or first place we were just playing
2265309 their nerves are probably a little more calm than ours
2265310 thats going to be our battle staying calm weve got to do it however we can
2265311 theres not a need for experience so much as perspective
2265312 having the right perspective allows us to play like ourselves it takes a lot of maturity to do that sometimes its almost like you need to let go downplay the situation we all have the capability of doing that
2265313 we know that weve beaten the cubs three times at home we beat the red sox six times at home weve done well against toronto we lead the season series with the angels 4 2 so we know we can play with anybody
2265314 but you have to be able to play with anybody in september
2265315 he gets less out of more than any player in the game
2265316 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier
2265317 were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
2265318 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
2265319 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
2265320 hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
2265321 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
2265322 its a good deal for pittsburgh they got four good players
2265323 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
2265324 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
2265325 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
2265326 we can talk about contracts after the season these are all hypothetical questions i know tony and angels owner arte moreno have a great relationship with scott boras im sure theyll talk in the future
2265327 were in it to win a world championship this speaks volumes to that
2265328 a world series for me would make this trade successful
2265329 but we dont want to do the manny papi thing we want to do a tex vladdy thing
2265330 you cant wait for the middle of the lineup to come around and make it happen
2265331 i think we certainly expect a deep lineup as weve been swinging the bats better the last 30 or 40 games the contributions have been coming from top to bottom thats what you need to do in order to pressure the opposing team every inning until you break through
2265332 if were going to keep it going its going to have to happen 1 through 9
2265333 a lot of people said we need that extra bat in the lineup
2265334 i would look at any opportunity to make us better
2265335 that scenario is unlikely but i would look at it
2265336 a world series for me would make this trade successful
2265337 i dont see anyone that can come in here for two months and hand me a world series trophy
2265338 im just here to get my ring and big contract
2265339 as i sit with my granddaughters sipping away not only is the tea warm but so is my heart
2265340 the name of the group refers to the desire to create music that doesnt sumbit itself to the standardization of the masses you can cut off the tail of the gecko but it will just grow back and the rhythmic pulse of the group the geckos tail continues to swing even after you cut it off
2265341 a fantastic book for young adults and for more middle aged ones too
2265342 a bittersweet story of first love with a disability twist
2265343 i would recommend this book to the young perhaps not the very young because of the references to sex and the young at heart

2265347 the problem with miracles is that we tend to get mesmerized by them focusing on gods responsibility and forgetting our own miracles let us off the hook they appeal to the part of us that is all too happy to let god feed the crowd save the world do it all
2265348 send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves
2265349 not me but you not my bread but yours not sometime or somewhere else but right here and now
2265350 stop waiting for a miracle and participate in one instead
2265351 and all ate and were filled and they took up what was left over of the broken pieces twelve baskets full

2265353 the seeds of heaven sermons on the gospel of matthew
2265354 the kingdom of god is within you and among you
2265355 our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
2265356 the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field when a man found it he hid it again and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field
2265357 the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls when he found one of great value he went away and sold everything he had and bought it
2265358 the reason i speak to them in parables is that
2265359 i have said these things to you while i am still with you but the advocate the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you everything and remind you of all that i have said to you
2265360 you stiff necked people uncircumcised in heart and ears you are forever opposing the holy spirit just as your ancestors used to do
2265361 let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches
2265362 let anyone who has an ear listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches
2265363 who shall stand in his holy place those who have clean hands and pure hearts who do not lift up their souls to what is false and do not swear deceitfully
2265364 prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment
2265365 bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of god

2265367 the repertoire of early choro musicians consisted of dance music imported from europe especially the waltz and the polka serenades and other local popular genres over time a new genre arose also known as choro which combined aspects of choro performance practice with the formal and harmonic structure of the polka thus we can speak of norms and tendencies in harmony melody rhythm form and structure that define the choro genre many of which are direct outgrowths of choro performance practice in terms of harmony the early choro was thoroughly grounded in contemporary european practice indeed the choro has never been harmonically progressive its attraction was in its expressive and rhythmic character and its showcasting of instrumental virtuosity as in choro style the distinguishing features of the choro genre are found in the melodies and the rhythm choros are easily identified by their melodies many of which are idiomatic to the instrument for which they were originally composed melodies and wide leaps arpeggios based on the harmonic progression and chromatic sequences are common most choros are modeled on the form of european dances from which the genre developed sections of regular and approximately equal length are typical and may be arranged in simple structures such as aabb aba and most commonly example abaca rondo form within these structures harmonic motion is predictable choro is of course more than its musical components
2265368 i think that a novel about love is as valid as any other

2265370 from the sky they could see just as god saw them the ruins of the very old and heroic city of cartagena de indias the most beautiful in the world abandoned by its inhabitants because of the sieges of the english and the atrocities of the buccaneers
2265371 they flew over the lake dwellings of the trojas in cataca painted in lunatic colors with pens holding iguanas raised for food and balsam apples and crepe myrtle hanging in the lacustrian gardens excited by everyones shouting hundreds of naked children plunged into the water jumping out of windows jumping from the roofs of the houses and from the canoes that they handled with astonishing skill and diving like shad to recover the bundles of clothing the bottles of cough syrup the beneficent food that the beautiful lady with the feathered hat threw to them from the basket of the balloon

2265379 a trav s de referendos hemos logrado en los a os del neoliberalismo defender las empresas petrolera telef nica de electricidad y de agua para que sigan en manos del estado y beneficiar a la sociedad
2265380 es un s ntoma de que las derechas en todo el mundo no apuestan por la participaci n de los ciudadanos hacen foros y hablan de la democracia pero en el momento de respetarla y llevarla adelante le dan la espalda
2265381 es realmente algo muy peligroso para la democracia cuando los representantes del pueblo no respetan la opini n del pueblo y pasa que los ciudadanos les d n la espalda y no los reelija
2265382 como latinoamericano lo que siempre valor fue que en la d cada de los 30 el gobierno mexicano hubiera recuperado para el pueblo la producci n petrolera y me parece que ser a un retroceso que aquello que se recuper ahora tenga que revertirse en funci n de los intereses del sector privado
2265383 tenemos que defendernos de la voracidad de las multinacionales y de los sectores privados locales de querer quitar al pueblo los recursos que tendr an que beneficiar a toda la sociedad
2265384 creo que s habr una respuesta clara en t rminos de movilizaci n y reclamo cada vez m s fuerte
2265385 pienso que lo mismo debe ser en m xico y en todos los pa ses que tenemos petr leo tratar de recuperarlo para que as se mejore la educaci n la salud y las condiciones de vida de la gente
2265386 el pueblo se levante y en alg n momento haga justicia
2265387 excelente iniciativa digna de ser imitada por muchas fuerzas pol ticas de am rica latina
2265388 si la consulta aun no siendo vinculatoria arroja un resultado abrumador por parte de la ciudadan a para mantener su industria petrolera como hasta ahora y es considerada leg tima pues obligatoriamente quienes toman las decisiones deber n tenerla en consideraci n
2265389 el crimen del gobierno al intentar privatizar el patrimonio de los mexicanos es m s grave cuando se ve que en el mundo la tendencia es aumentar la participaci n del estado en la industria del petr leo no disminuirla

2265392 pero si tuvieran algo relevante ya lo habr an presentado
2265393 contra todas las expectativas la consulta ciudadana sobre la reforma de petr leos mexicanos ha sido exitosa satisfactoria y sobre todo un proceso limpio
2265394 pese a la campa a permanente de desprestigio a la abusiva publicidad del gobierno en favor de la iniciativa de felipe calder n y a no tener acceso a la televisi n para llamar a la participaci n los resultados obtenidos son muy buenos es un xito
2265395 si no hubiese habido toda esa campa a en contra del ejercicio c vico f cilmente se hubiera duplicado la participaci n ciudadana
2265396 estamos muy contentos los resultados son los m s altos que se han tenido en una consulta de este tipo y sobre todo ha sido un proceso limpio
2265397 dije que si nosotros logr bamos un mill n de participantes nos sentir amos satisfechos si logr bamos mill n y medio ser a un xito y arriba de eso todav a ser a mejor sos son los par metros que podr an ser factibles porque no tuvimos acceso a la televisi n porque no hubo programas en favor de la consulta y s en cambio toda una campa a permanente de desprestigio y frente a eso es indudable que tiene que haber un impacto
2265398 no tenemos informaci n que nos preocupe ya vemos declaraciones del pan dicen que tienen videograbaciones de irregularidades en la jornada ciudadana qui n sabe cu ntas cosas dicen francamente no creo que tengan nada relevante si tuvieran algo ya lo hubieran presentado
2265399 estaban esperando grandes acarreos en delegaciones del distrito federal como iztapalapa pero se quedaron esperando ya que el proceso fue pulcro limpio y hubo vigilancia exhaustiva por parte de los medios de comunicaci n sobre todo en la capital y la zona metropolitana
2265400 pese a los embates los resultados obtenidos son satisfactorios lo m s preocupante es que nuestra consulta se hubiera podido ensuciar y no hay ninguna informaci n en ese sentido el ejercicio ciudadano lo hicieron partidos y organizaciones sociales y en contra de todo lo que esperaban los detractores no ocurri nada de eso fue un proceso limpio porque a todos los uni la defensa de una causa importante la defensa del petr leo
2265401 esta participaci n no puede ser como la de una elecci n constitucional todo mundo lo sab amos nuestro punto de referencia son otros ejercicios similares por ejemplo el ltimo que se hizo en la ciudad fue la consulta verde y participaron 300 mil personas el gobierno del estado de m xico convoc a una y la asistencia fue de entre 5 mil y 10 mil participantes los par metros son otros
2265402 gea aisa la encuesta m s sesgada en favor del gobierno da 45 por ciento de ciudadanos en contra
2265403 nos va a obligar a todos no nada m s a las fuerzas progresistas sino al pri y al pan a que demos un paso a lo que se ha venido ofreciendo desde hace mucho tiempo por lo menos desde hace 15 a os que es el establecimiento de mecanismos de democracia directa ah est n las iniciativas en el congreso una de ellas la firm felipe calder n cuando fue diputado federal
2265404 se hizo con un m nimo de recursos las 25 mil personas que participaron no recibieron sueldo y se me parece un gran m rito
2265405 desde las 9 30 de la ma ana pas por calles de la colonia roma de la condesa cuando fui a votar y vi mucha gente en la primera estaban instaladas las casillas fui por san cosme por ju rez y vi gente que iba con sus hijos a votar
2265406 en polanco en las lomas no hab a tanta gente pero ah estaban las casillas la gente pasaba tranquila me di cuenta de la tranquilidad en la que transcurr a la consulta sin violencia ni acarreados no hubo desorden hasta ahorita me informaron s lo de un desorden en hidalgo donde unas monjitas dijeron que la consulta era cosa del diablo no obstante que la televisi n no pas programas de la consulta y a las declaraciones obtusas de germ n mart nez dirigente nacional del pan hubo ciudadanos que salieron a manifestarse fueron a pronunciarse como dice manuel camacho es un aprendizaje
2265407 los datos apenas est n llegando pero no todos los que participaron votaron por el no hay una alta votaci n por el s no fueron acarreos para decirle no a las iniciativas de calder n los ciudadanos fueron a votar seg n su convicci n
2265408 yo esperaba que todos fueran a decir no pero es notable el hecho de que haya salido gente a decir s a las reformas de calder n esto es un ejercicio ciudadano es una consulta ciudadana y es muy importante para m que haya ido gente a decir s

2265506 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company
2265507 this was probably the new fuel saving initiative by the company management to save money

2265509 relaying my opinion on the reduced fuel load and my suggestion not to compromise fuel loads in and out of florida
2265510 because in an attempt to abide by the new fuel conservation procedures just adopted by the company not enough fuel was put on the aircraft to handle a simple delay in an effort to save money an aircraft had to divert the aircraft arrived at its destination two hours late finally the pilots had to get off their trip early because of fatigue and because they would have flown nine hours and 40 minutes if they had continued on
2265511 ten minutes of hold fuel remained unchanged because management is pressuring dispatch to fly with limited hold fuel to reduce costs
2265512 ten minutes of hold fuel into an airport with marginal conditions because the dispatcher does not want his her name on the fuel list for the week printed and hung by management contacted dispatcher and after captain requested it fuel was begrudgingly added to
2265513 the problem is that with all the great minds that focus on the issue none can figure out what the problem is
2265514 we dont know when we will know smart people are working on it

2265547 this is a play about family wounds and healing welcome to the family
2265548 bring together students that may not be part of the mainstage family and to give them an opportunity to perform and produce plays that they wanted to do
2265549 to reach out to the audience and widen their worlds and let them glimpse into worlds that they may never encounter in their lifetime
2265550 topdog underdog fulfills this mission by showing such a world that most of us will never experience a world of poverty and desperate times
2265551 the world of topdog underdog is a world that is presented raw and upfront with unapologetic honesty and biting humor
2265552 you wouldnt normally see a play of this style on the mainstage in my opinion
2265553 the audience should know that these characters are a product of the society that we live in they are creatures of tragic proportions that are disillusioned and angry at the institution that has been forcing them to live on the edge of humanity
2265554 for me this performance is a gift marking the first time in this department that i have had an opportunity to play an african american character rather than a colorblind role
2265555 i want the audience to feel a connection with the struggles of the characters and more importantly i want the audience to appreciate the words of the mastermind suzan lori parks
2265556 i dont want to influence anyone before they have a chance to see the piece for themselves this piece is so incredible and multifaceted so everyone will take away something completely different such is art
2265557 the characters in this comic tragedy are defined by their history but throughout the course of the play i believe the characters find ways to break free from the attachments of their history
2265558 to know if we are defined by history we must confront history by watching this show i want the audience to answer this question for themselves
2265559 ill put this on your tab pay me next time

2265589 every time they do that they are showing an implicit trust in whoever wrote the application and most people dont know who that is
2265590 social networks really dont care if you get pawned or not
2265591 people know if they go on a computer and download a program they could get a virus they dont have the same view of how dangerous that can be on a social networking site
2265592 once the content is moved from their site they have no control over that

2265621 as we have stated all along chicago is fully committed to building the entire program
2265622 popejoys decision moves us one step closer to realizing that goal
2265623 chicago has failed to show how they plan to pay for this misguided billion dollar boondoggle
2265624 if chicago cannot prove there is an adequate funding mechanism bulldozing our town will be a wasteful unnecessary and cruel burden on the people of bensenville

2265638 the school was insured so the computers will be replaced by the insurance company minus the deductible of course but its just a shame that this happened
2265639 here we are trying to create a wonderful learning environment for children and someone does this its disheartening
2265640 it all started about seven years ago when my generation of friends went to a village hall meeting and persuaded the members of the board to build the skate park
2265641 after a couple years i noticed the people who used to attend the skate park were not going as much anymore thats when i realized we not only had to create an effort to bring back the skaters but create something to engage the community
2265642 the competition gives skateboarders in the area something to look forward to
2265643 its a great opportunity for those who have signed up to practice their skills and show off some new tricks and their talents
2265644 we will be judging on style quantity of tricks and technique
2265645 we are going to treat everyone equal that means we are going to root for the beginners just as much as the experts
2265646 we will have first second and third prizes for skateboarders per each division of beginners intermediates and experts
2265647 if a skateboarders second run is not as good as their first run we will judge the better score
2265648 we want people to realize that skateboarding is a sport and it takes a lot of hard work and practice for competitions like the one we are hosting
2265649 we hope to change a few perspectives and bring a more skate orientated environment into antioch

2265668 when our boeing orbiting space colony becomes really really huge do you think that our descendants of both we the current space colonists and of the new colonists still to be sent up by boeing and microsoft and the other space companies of king county i mean do you think they will build space monorails or will they continue to float and glide themselves and their equipment through the zero gravity of space as we do now
2265669 my precious but high priced sonja i think that our descendants will continue to develop our abundant solar power and manufacturing capability and will experiment with monorails but to make economic sense monorails require a lot and lot of people in a really small area
2265670 to be profitable monorails require a huge number of people who use them regularly and around the clock
2265671 isnt that what we are building here in this colony
2265672 down on earth i found the expensive subway under montreal both exciting and depressing but i found the expensive monorail of vancouver canada uplifting
2265673 american cities are usually of such low population density that there is not a high enough concentration of people to enable the users to pay for the publicly owned transit systems privatization and competition might be solutions
2265674 since the government has promoted urban sprawl by way of hight restrictions on buildings the transit users have been spread out over a huge area of low population density therefore the government transit systems turn out to be real money losers the tax payers end up paying for the loss to lessen the burden on the tax payers i wanted the people to build beautiful high density communities filled with sky homes better than in vancouver canada i wanted to abolish building height restrictions and high permit fees i wanted to make it easy to build sky high condominiums and apartment building i wanted to decrease housing costs by increasing the supply of housing in the air to get rid of rush hours i also wanted to build 24 hour never stop go go cities in king county
2265675 true but up here in the high sky of orbital space our descendants should exercise their muscles for a long time by walking a lot in the gravity corridors to balance out the time they spend playing floating and gliding around in zero gravity
2265676 i felt like we were really spending time with cher i like actors and actresses who imitate great people and sonja might be an actress to start the movie making industry up here in orbital space a poem about sonja and space monorails just popped into my mind
2265677 oh who will pay for our fun and frenzied riding times
2265678 please please stop our dollars and dimes will not be enough let us avoid frenzied transit monorails paying for transit trips will be too tough
2265679 i dont think sonja is going to like your poem
2265680 but dave i suspected that sonja would like a poem about her
2265681 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
2265682 the design was done in korea at the sparkling new state of the art design center in namyang with regular design reviews from both our american and european design staffs that was also true for the chassis development you asked about sachs in germany was directly involved in suspension design and tuning there were sachs engineers at the kia america technical centers in irvine california and superior township in michigan every few weeks to finish the five link geometry springs and sachs asd amplitude adaptive damping details wendell collins was our lead chassis engineer and we are very proud of what he accomplished the final set up includes a 35mm anti roll bar at the front of both models and 18mm rear bar for the v8 and 17mm for the six trw co developed our electro hydraulic power steering components and i saw a lot of the country during the testing and refinement process i would be driving with two trw engineers in the car with laptops making incremental changes in the programming
2265683 jason ingersoll photo collection is a literal treasure trove of information and they reveal the sequence of events that led to the staging of light pole 1 on route 27 headed southbound while giving an incredible look into the details as they unfolded
2265684 one of these images is possible evidence that the pole
2265685 the contraction will be in the order of magnitude of minus one per cent
2265686 bear in mind though that this is partly a correction after the exceptionally good first quarter

2265696 tonight they will discuss that fateful week at chateau marmont
2265697 i am certain that this is the end of my writing career
2265698 i just think that this would be a waste of taxpayers dollars
2265699 if a site allows any kind of links at all then what a user does after they follow that link is really out of control of the social networking site
2265700 they can keep blocking the links to malicious sites as they pop up and they can try to educate their user base but thats about it facebook is likely at the mercy of the security of each users home computer
2265701 it doesnt say cox unless i say it tastes like cox
2265702 pointers and handles a story of unchecked assumptions in the windows kernel
2265703 most people will turn and run or get mowed down but i will not go quietly into the night im fighting back
2265704 creating and managing a multi domain search solution that comprehensively addresses user requirements present a number of security technical and usability challenges
2265705 her hair is so soft its like silk and shes sooo good her eyes are blue just like your grandmothers and your mothers and aubreys shes starting to get chubby too
2265706 i wonder whether those of our political masters who have been put in charge of the defence of the country can distinguish a mortar from a motor a gun from a howitzer a guerrilla from a gorilla although a great many of them in the past have resembled the latter
2265707 honouring him in death as they did in life were field marshal manekshaw the three service chiefs all of whom belonged to the same course and at whose passing out parade from the joint services wing father had presided the gracious chief minister m veerappa moily and c k jaffer sharief minister for railways representing the president as the supreme commanded of the armed forces
2265708 indian government screws up field marshal manekshaws passing away rites
2265709 how could you ask him if he was in tea business dont you know you are sitting next to field marshal manekshaw
2265710 no of course i did not know otherwise i would not have asked my stupid question
2265711 more geese than swans now live more fools than wise
2265712 it is going to come down to the individuals decision
2265713 if you think that im here in minnesota that im going to throw my white sox under the bus its not going to happen
2265714 in terms of magnitudes of scale the less power we use the more efficient we are that will probably have a bigger impact on the environment than anything else
2265715 weve seen a lot of h1b people come in from india thats a concern of mine since some of my friends have been laid off
2265716 now companies will argue that were getting these folks because theyre the only ones who can do the job
2265717 i dont believe that i see qualified people ushered out the door
2265718 im happy for obama breaking the racial thing if hes elected hes my president
2265719 ill support him and pray for him but ill have a hole in my heart that this country is morally going off of the deep end
2265720 he started out like a regular guy like us a single mother stuff like that
2265721 we noticed he had cracks in his shoes we liked that its important to have regular shoes
2265722 they were normal shoes i thought theyd be all fancy he seemed down to earth it was something
2265723 lots of folks ponied up 28 500 and had a few bites of dinner with him probably a lot more than were in there having breakfast this morning ill guarantee you that that was his main purpose of being here was to raise money
2265724 suburbs have been able to dodge that bullet a bit longer than urban schools because they are both less diverse and have fewer of the high risk students as a group that was probably next in line to be flagged it was probably suburban schools
2265725 it might have been english language learners or special education students
2265726 you have to look in general at your school site we dont have that many districts or schools that have chronically underperformed
2265727 so you have to look at the total package if you will before you get real concerned
2265728 if youre going to have these penalties they better be showing that theyre doing what we want them to do as it appears right now they take resources from the school and lower the scores id say thats indicative of whats happening so id like to see a change in it
2265729 who can protest and does not is an accomplice in the act
2265730 well you shouldve called the cops to get an incident report
2265731 well theres no point having just one i shant bother at all
2265732 its certainly a really good sign that the community are going to stay focused on their indoor water saving as we ease restrictions and its a great boost of confidence i guess in terms of future relaxation of restrictions at other dam levels
2265733 my bosses dont respect my side of the story when something goes wrong

2265747 its almost exactly the sort of cover you could expect to find on the front of national review
2265748 privately some mccain types admit they find the cover funny and how bad can it be for your campaign when a national magazine in an effort to take a shot at fox news and talk radio portrays your opponent like this

2265753 dont expect your baby or toddler to like your family pet much or at all in china it is rare to treat animals as part of the family and young chinese children can often be scared or impatient with animals they will warm up eventually but be careful not to force the relationship
2265754 infants from the orphanage are not accustomed to silence while they are sleeping
2265755 air conditioning could make your child sick until they grow accustomed to it
2265756 now for my most important advice of all please do not try to bury your childs negative memories with false fantasies of what you hope would have been their life before you let them have their memories talk them through when they can and learn to get through the hurt your child may have had a wonderful orphanage or a loving foster family but they may have lived through something that you can never imagine to hide or skip over those emotions fears or resentment could cause more damage to an already fragile spirit seek counseling if you think it necessary but take off your rose colored glasses and open yourself up to the harsh reality of third world orphanages i wish your children long lives of love protection and success you are blessed to have them so treasure your gifts
2265757 sporty aggressive and modern not words you commonly associate with genesis coupe doesnt try to be a muscle car in the vein of the american concept it busts through those doors to create something thats a combination of sport and a bit of luxury that will still appeal to those who want power
2265758 our design objective for the concept was to create a tuner version of the production car this allowed us to exaggerate the front and rear fascia designs as well as introduce more aftermarket design details in keeping with a tuner image
2265759 this is one of the best arguments for a separate brand i think hyundai had considered that exact proposition there are a number of reasons why they didnt follow through hyundai hired an outside consultant to estimate the cost of launching a standalone brand and the number they quoted was 250 million with a break even point 13 years hence for a company focused on delivering a lot for a little and not selling cars at a loss thats a large number to spend in the unscientific arena of penetrating brand consciousness which is what this would come down to and we assume that is the necessary number only if the brand succeeds as intended other standalone brands have spent much more than that to launch in the u s and arguably still havent met their objectives beyond hard cash is the softer marketing driven reason azeras

2265762 when people purchase an expensive apartment a famous architect is extra validation theyre making a good choice
2265763 the selection of an international architect or planner is driven by the unique needs of the project for instance the 325 acre mahindra world city project is one of the largest such developments under implementation and to that extent the width and depth of on ground implementation experience is currently available only with international firms who have conceived and implemented such projects in different parts of the world
2265764 foreign firms can visualise and handle massive scale also their designs are very innovative they create landmarks and not just buildings
2265765 working with foreign firms gives us exposure to international standards there is a lot to learn from their use of detailing and modern materials
2265766 i spend more than three months a year in india familiarising myself with the ground situation
2265767 its a unique design challenge recreating the same sense of community that exists in their current housing so that people dont want to return to the slums they left
2265768 education and social interaction are both important to indians so our designs will reflect these needs so residential units would have schools nearby and public spaces for people to interact
2265769 i am constantly studying the history and traditions of india hoping to integrate some of its characteristics in my buildings and though my work is definitely contemporary the clues from the past are integrated in a modern vocabulary

2265847 i awoke and thought of a stressful event to deal with this day and i became anxious i felt the pain of anxiety come into my gut and my stomach then thinking in terms of front and back i thought pain just doesnt belong here and still in bed i moved this energy back into my spine and away from my organs and it became strength my resolve to stand up to the events of this day so i dont know but the metaphor has its uses what do you think about that
2265848 thanks for sharing that what do i think i think that its great that this metaphor works for you and affords you the means to work with conflicting emotions like anxiety and find a means to transform that emotion into strength we all use different methods right whatever works and is appropriate at that time for where we are at for myself when something like anxiety arises then i simply allow it fully into awareness as much as im able not pushing it away not seeking to transform it not in any way trying to grasp or reject it but allowing awareness and what arises to mix fully when im fully and deeply aware of this arisen emotion i tend to see it for what it is simply appearance mirage like appearance devoid of any solidity location or attributes in any way its there yet its not there a dance of illusion seeing thus what seems to have arisen simply self liberates its runs its course and melts away without struggle without conflict without grasping or rejecting just what is without the hooks into the psyche with that ease is neither won nor lost different flavours play and flicker but what actually changes well thats the way i go or sometimes try to go one thing ive found very useful is when an emotion arises to see what is going on physically emotionally and at the level of storyline or thought not analysing any of them just allowing it fully into awareness and watching if you like at all three levels doing thus takes all the bite out of the emotion allows us to see the way we habitually react to that which we dont want to experience and allows those patterns to dissolve in the sun of awareness weakened and less able to hold us in their habitual grip many thanks for your sharing and very best wishes to you

2265855 this tendency for motion or for rest to maintain itself steadily unless made to do otherwise by some interfering force can be viewed as a kind of laziness a kind of unwillingness to make a change

2265860 we just have concerns that the language now is overly harsh and provides too little latitude to property owners
2265861 theyre telling us that theyre not interested in revoking everyones license on the first call and that the language is there so that it has teeth
2265862 well we think they should either enforce it how its written or change the language to reflect what theyre telling us because folks are getting scared
2265863 if theres one bad tenant in a 100 unit complex and the owner loses his license do the good people in the other 99 units have to find a new home or will they only restrict the owners license to rent that one unit for a year
2265864 it is easy also to understand why protest becomes a distinctive moral feature of the modern age and why indignation is a predominant modern emotion to protest and its latin predecessors and french cognates are originally as often or more often positive as negative to protest was once to bear witness to something and only as a consequence of that allegiance to bear witness against something else
2265865 but protest is now almost entirely that negative phenomenon which characteristically occurs as a reaction to the alleged invasion of someones rights in the name of someone elses utility the self assertive shrillness of protest arises because the facts of incommensurability ensure that protestors can never win an argument the indignant self righteousness arises because the facts of incommensurability ensure equally that the protestor can never lose an argument either hence the utterance of protest is characteristically addressed to those who already share the protestors premises the effects of incommensurability ensure that the protestors rarely have anyone else to talk to but themselves this is not to say that protest cannot be effective it is to say that it cannot be rationally effective and that its dominant modes of expression give evidence of a certain perhaps unconscious awareness of this

2265867 this award is particularly gratifying for our team who started with a world class car listened to customer feedback telling us they wanted an improved interior and went to work to make the 2009 stand up and stand out against every other car in its class

2265874 electric vehicles are the future and the driver of the industrial revolution
2265875 clearly i am just looking at some of the significant seizures last year and i think the biggest one was about 100 kilos or so of ecstasy so you are talking about the biggest seizure last year
2265876 generally the production of ecstasy is european based i note this one was intercepted en route from italy or another part of europe for instance holland has been traditionally an area of narcotic production but we are also seeing production in our asia pacific region particularly the asian region increasing as well
2265877 to actually understand how effective it is you need to know what the total market size is and to understand how much then you are seizing what percentage you are seizing
2265878 now what we dont know is if catching this much what has got in around the other side or some other way demand and supply economics will dictate that when supply is restricted the price will increase
2265879 it is hard to know what will happen it never did hit the streets we would estimate this would be a significant dent in the availability of ecstasy on the streets
2265880 often what we find is when you hear about overdoses and unfortunately some fatalities that occur people think they are taking ecstasy or thought they were taking ecstasy a lot of time and they havent
2265881 they have been provided with another drug even though they were told it was ecstasy
2265882 it is still not as prevalent as cannabis or anything like that which is the most widely used illicit drug but its use has been increasing whilst cannabis and heroin and a range of other drugs has been decreasing
2265883 we know that methamphetamines and ice the use has stabilised but ecstasy still holds in the minds of lot of people particularly young people holds a position of it being a relatively safe drug or a safer drug to use
2265884 it is viewed positively and that increases peoples desire or propensity to use that drug
2265885 i think that is why we have a bit of a battle on our hands with ecstasy more so than we do with methamphetamines and ice which i think people are recognising now as being quite problematic in terms of their health and psychological impact on people
2265886 this is an area an industry that is worth billions and billions of dollars
2265887 it attracts a lot of people into it with the lure of money and when you have that sort of money available it is not something you are ever going to beat
2265888 what it means is that the battle will be ongoing and we need to not only look at restricting supply but also looking at providing demand reduction and harm reduction services as well
2265889 it is not something that you just have a three year plan for a five year plan for it is something we are going to have to deal with over the very long term
2265890 weve lived up the street from each other our entire lives

2265900 rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind
2265901 neither this man nor his parents sinned he was born blind so that gods works might be revealed in him we must work the works of him who sent me while it is day night is coming when no one can work as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world
2265902 is this not the man who used to sit and beg
2265903 the man called jesus made mud spread it on my eyes and said to me go to siloam and wash then i went and washed and received my sight
2265904 he put mud on my eyes then i washed and now i see
2265905 this man is not from god for he does not observe the sabbath
2265906 how can a man who is a sinner perform such signs
2265907 what do you say about him it was your eyes he opened
2265908 is this your son who you say was born blind how then does he now see
2265909 we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but we do not know how it is that now he sees nor do we know who opened his eyes ask him he is of age he will speak for himself
2265910 give glory to god we know that this man is a sinner
2265911 i do not know whether he is a sinner one thing i do know that though i was blind now i see
2265912 what did he do to you how did he open your eyes
2265913 i have told you already and you would not listen why do you want to hear it again do you also want to become his disciples
2265914 you are his disciple but we are disciples of moses we know that god has spoken to moses but as for this man we do not know where he comes from
2265915 here is an astonishing thing you do not know where he comes from and yet he opened my eyes we know that god does not listen to sinners but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind if this man were not from god he could do nothing
2265916 you were born entirely in sins and are you trying to teach us
2265917 and who is he sir tell me so that i may believe in him
2265918 you have seen him and the one speaking with you is he
2265919 i came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see and those who do see may become blind
2265920 if you were blind you would not have sin but now that you say we see your sin remains
2265921 you were born entirely in sins and are you trying to teach us
2265922 i just want people to know that i didnt kill my friend
2265923 i was scared to death i was charged with a murder i didnt do
2265924 i said what do you mean this is a bad idea
2265925 i told 911 that i was charged with murder and i was following the car of the man who had been killed
2265926 the evidence initially pointed to powell the more we collected it pointed to jones
2265927 isnt it funny that donald powell just got out of jail and he stumbles across that car
2265928 i smell a rat we had cars all over jefferson county looking for allens car we had airplanes in the sky looking for it and donald powell finds it
2265929 ive never seen anything like this in my 40 years
2265930 this is the first time ive seen someone charged with murder help solve the case i know the odds of that happening are high but just because someone is charged it doesnt mean he is guilty
2265931 in 1988 we created a plan for the library and said it was for 20 years

2265941 mental projections way outnumber the dust motes you see in the sunlight a great yogi knows what appears for what it is
2265942 at bottom the nature of things isnt a product of causes nor of conditions a great yogi cuts to the core of the issue
2265943 even a hundred men with spears couldnt stop the thought bubbles of consciousness a great yogi knows not to get hung up on them
2265944 you cant lock up the flow of mind in an iron box a great yogi knows mind to be intrinsically empty
2265945 wisdom gods and goddesses dont say no to sensory pleasures a great yogi knows this full well
2265946 the buddhas own hands couldnt block the appearance of objects to the consciousness a great yogi knows there is no object behind the appearance
2265947 may i come to know that which i only understand and may all beings be free from afflictions and struggle
2265948 you can guarantee that more of these will become common in future elections
2265949 more than likely the people who do this are the extremists or people who are in it for a profit campaigns need to become more aware of these kinds of attacks
2265950 obama is paying for advertisements through google on a site that is a typo squatter on a domain name the obama campaign should own in the first place
2265951 campaigns are spending a lot on online advertising and some of this money is really being misspent and going to typo squatters
2265952 if i want to attack supporters of a particular campaign i can easily put malware on my site
2265953 you can target candidates cause confusion pop up ads or re direct computers when they try to log on to a candidates website
2265954 this is a serious problem that spans not only campaigns but every company with email
2265955 some degree of competitive adjustment is probably needed but the huge scale of the shock that is unfolding in spain will almost certainly require a macroeconomic response that spain cannot deliver on its own so what actions would be needed in the very short run a transfer mechanism to provide help for countries in severe distress of course any transfers would have to come with imf style conditions attached
2265956 one size fits all policy has been administered see in particular
2265957 by alan ahearne juan delgado and jakob von weizs cker also on rge last friday
2265958 oh man im going to deliver my baby into the toilet
2265959 my mother pays you so i can have whatever i want
2265960 how is it that you a jew ask a drink of me a woman of samaria
2265961 if you knew the gift of god and who it is that is saying to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water
2265962 sir you have no bucket and the well is deep where do you get that living water are you greater than our ancestor jacob who gave us the well and with his sons and his flocks drank from it
2265963 everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again but those who drink of the water that i will give them will never be thirsty the water that i will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life
2265964 sir give me this water so that i may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water
2265965 you are right in saying i have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband what you have said is true
2265966 sir i see that you are a prophet our ancestors worshiped on this mountain but you say that the place where people must worship is in jerusalem
2265967 woman believe me the hour is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem you worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the jews but the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father seeks such as these to worship him god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth
2265968 when he comes he will proclaim all things to us
2265969 i am he the one who is speaking to you
2265970 come and see a man who told me everything i have ever done he cannot be the messiah can he
2265971 i have food to eat that you do not know about
2265972 my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work do you not say four months more then comes the harvest but i tell you look around you and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting the reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life so that sower and reaper may rejoice together for here the saying holds true one sows and another reaps i sent you to reap that for which you did not labor others have labored and you have entered into their labor
2265973 it is no longer because of what you said that we believe for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this is truly the savior of the world
2265974 it took me a while to comprehend what i was seeing
2265975 there was a big bear chewing on the feeder and busting up the plastic i was just in shock really
2265976 theyre hitting garbage cans and bird feeders looking for something to eat
2265977 i thought you know i love the 50s everything people did it was new it just seemed like such an innovative time
2265978 this is a whole new batch of kids who havent experienced the 50s
2265979 this is the first big musical ive done with them every day i learn something new from them
2265980 ive taken several of their ideas and put them into the show i encourage their ideas one of the things i love i can act goofy with them and get them to laugh and they make me laugh as well
2265981 a friend cares enough to tell you when youre going the wrong way dont be afraid to confront a friend and be willing to listen when a friend confronts you its one of the many reasons why god gave us friends to help us grow a friend never gets in your way unless you happen to be going down
2265982 theres a lot of things you can do with a spread offense
2265983 we can run the ball throw the ball we have our slots slots are like running backs who can run routes so we can have them in the backfield or spread out as receivers we have a lot of things we can do well be able to make up the slack
2265984 the primary goal for the whole team is winning the centennial conference
2265985 and thats the top priority for our defense too to be the best defense in the centennial conference
2265986 when we had those great years we kind of set the bar pretty high and maybe that became my own worst enemy in that regard
2265987 but when the bar was set high our opponents pursued the bar we slipped a little bit thats the past im optimistic about the future i want to move forward
2265988 in the recent past since we were good we havent played like a team
2265989 weve been playing like individuals this young group that we have they really seem to enjoy each others company
2265990 definitely weve got to get some people back for the losses we got last year
2265991 obviously id like to be going later at this event
2265992 the strides we have made as a program are still fragile
2265993 our total roster is still a bit smaller than we would ideally have it and we arent deep in terms of experience at several positions we are poised to make a serious run at the centennial conference health will be a factor but it is more a matter of maintaining that attitude that we saw over the final three games
2265994 the mind that clings to emptiness dissolves in its own ground
2265995 ive put together these lines that they may last for aeons to come
2265996 it brings with it a little more drama that way theres a little more heart to this than the movie
2265997 i fell in love with the music before ever seeing the show
2265998 he was crazy and wild he was always getting drunk and getting into trouble
2265999 its easy to play a drunk its hard to play the emotional scenes when swann is not drunk
2266000 its fun you get to play with it and have a good time you need to have all your lines down cold
2266001 i want that benjy should bring alan swann home to dinner in brooklyn
2266002 its the first time ive ever done this ive been watching my children all do this for years
2266003 i never realized how much work it is i just thought they were having a good time
2266004 im acting with many other people that have a lot of experience
2266005 isnt it nice to say you have done so much for gurnee that we should honor you at the start of gurnee days
2266006 they see what we have and show up with friends neighbors and family
2266007 the issue of civilian casualties is hugely sensitive in afghanistan
2266008 the latest claim of civilian casualties puts yet more pressure on the afghan authorities and international forces to get it right when carrying out operations
2266009 the concern of the board all along has been trying to preserve as much parking as possible
2266010 its fair to say overall the board is happy with the new design were able to bring a lot more natural light into the building
2266011 they can e mail ahead and well have the materials waiting they wont have to tie up a parking space
2266012 theyre tying it in to the existing building and softening it up its a nice plan
2266013 the community really opens its arms to having athletes there which is nice
2266014 its an exciting event just to see people of all ages competing in the triathlon out there biking and swimming for a couple hours
2266015 it just gives athletes of all abilities a chance to participate in this type of race
2266016 when the story was in about the fresh foods suit we got an e mail from a resident saying thats nice but what about the shell station
2266017 on numerous occasions village officials have met with individuals interested in the property and have offered assistance in finding new businesses to occupy the space including other oil companies however the property has remained vacant and boarded up
2266018 theres a lot of interest out there so we can be really picky
2266019 theyve said most new theaters are maxing out at 14 screens
2266020 they feel that thats the saturation point unless they put out a new batman movie every weekend
2266021 i just think of the rosemont area as being on an island
2266022 some people are scaling back on spending so why would people travel to this muvico theater as much as i love the concept i will not use it on a regular basis
2266023 we had a few trees come down not many power issues
2266024 we were able to clean it up the next day and it was not nearly as bad as some other storms weve had before
2266025 most of the remaining outages dont affect large number of customers
2266026 the extra crews help us get to small pockets of customers
2266027 repeated addition is a way to calculate multiplication not a meaning of it
2266028 the string of bad cyclical news coming out of spain in recent weeks has turned investors more cautious on the credit
2266029 the number of new homes this year will hit an all time high more than in 2007
2266030 the real estate sector cant turn around quickly it works in the medium and long term so this year the properties started at the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006 will be completed which means the number of new properties on the market will hit an all time high
2266031 spain bubble bursting we now expect a full blown recession
2266032 the real estate sector cant turn around quickly it works in the medium and long term so this year the properties started at the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006 will be completed which means the number of new properties on the market will hit an all time high
2266033 with united nations population projections pointing to growth of only 300k per year on a high population variant for 2010 15 housing starts could fall considerably further hence the risks to our central forecast of 30 off housing investment by end 2009 are to the downside the correction could be more rapid than expected if not it is likely to persist into 2010 our forecast has housing investment converging to levels consistent with relatively strong population growth a weaker population assumption or some undershoot of the equilibrium level would lead to a worse outcome
2266034 in recent years between 120 000 and 125 000 holiday homes were sold each year this year it will be half that
2266035 she ate cat food eh thats ok poop id worry about but a little kibble never hurt anyone
2266036 this is impressive and obviously there was a lot of community involvement
2266037 it is a unique project compared to what we have seen there are not a lot of memorial parks usually they are ball parks or concession stands
2266038 there was a lot of community involvement and community spirit in this memorial
2266039 to even get a site visit and knowing they took a look at our application and sent judges from southern illinois is enough for us
2266040 our ponies were running every which way in the pouring rain but none of them got hurt thank goodness for that
2266041 but in massive power outages like these the last ones without power are always the hardest ones to restore
2266042 we shot over 250 photos to make sure everything was documented
2266043 from what we can determine the tornado hit the front of the dome and actually lifted the front of the dome at the base
2266044 and the rest kind of deflated from there the staff were huddled on site by the driving range and they could hear the trees coming and the dome ripping
2266045 our main focus is working overtime to pick up debris
2266046 thats probably going to be consuming public works for the next few weeks
2266047 it is not that they are not needed in elgin
2266048 it is just that in this case they are needed in chicago
2266049 if there are other cities experiencing problems that need help i think that is a good use of resources
2266050 given half a chance the schott 50 state report on public education for black males
2266051 we feel that the use of these mobile classrooms segregate our children from the general student body
2266052 we want to know how socioeconomic backgrounds are affecting education
2266053 from what ive seen i think its time for you to move on this thing do it
2266054 we need a firmer cost than what we have here
2266055 it has become imperative that the federal government pay particular attention to the devastating impact of cyber criminality and terrorism in the e commerce and electronic fund transfer landscape to prevent possible loss of confidence in the deployment of it as a veritable tool for accelerated development of the national economy
2266056 there is a need to fortify e commerce security and e payment lapses to shore up confidence in the system
2266057 pa kaj je s tabo si pa lupina nau i se iveti s tem
2266058 sem probala vse sem probala k velikemu u itelju sem hodila da bi me nau il iveti z lupino je rekel da bo sama po ila ko bo as ampak jaz ne morem ve akati tebi je lahko ti nisi po ena
2266059 ah ko bo as bom tudi jaz po ila do takrat bom pa e naprej veselo lupinila po svetu in se zabijala v skalovje ez mene bodo hodili in vozili in ni vrag da se bom enkrat razpo ila
2266060 lupina jaz ne morem ve resno zaleti se vame z vsem sunkom jaz se ho em osvobodit
2266061 ampak to bo umor ne bom se zaletela vate kar sama se zaleti nekam
2266062 malo ponosa pa le imej lupina kak ne pa stresa
2266063 aaaaah kaj naj storim kdo me bo razpo il sama se vendar ne morem
2266064 this is a deserted place and it is already late dismiss the crowds so that they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves
2266065 there is no need for them to go away give them some food yourselves
2266066 five loaves and two fish are all we have here
2266067 alright this non religious girl just asked me to sleep over in her apartment im going to get lucky
2266068 hey you dont have a place to stay no big deal we have the room
2266069 no we didnt have a van thats why we laughed the next day when we found out that they were saying it was a van
2266070 mr sarno says mr sarno mr salerno thats a slip there
2266071 i have not heard one bit of evidence that someone gave an order from the chicago outfit
2266072 how to help the family when chronic mental illness paralyzes the entire family
2266073 there is only so much we can do about it
2266074 she moved in after the trucking company was there and she knew the trucks run at night
2266075 our position is that just because this evidence is not find able at this point does not necessarily mean it gets suppressed
2266076 we can prove its the same blood that was taken from scoliere and was the same blood that was tested we can show we have a tight chain of evidence up to the test
2266077 we dont even know necessarily that that is her blood
2266078 weve lost the opportunity to have our own experts evaluate the sample
2266079 of course our job is to make sure these things all can be prosecuted as successfully as possible
2266080 its just basically human error in my experience the more people involved in these chains of evidence the more opportunity you have for things to go wrong
2266081 critique our practices and suggest ways to improve the way we conduct our business
2266082 that would communicate well and clearly how multiplication differs in some deep way from addition
2266083 you could always ask the children to imagine helium balloons attached to either side
2266084 i model represent and explain multiplication as repeated addition rectangular arrays and skip counting
2266085 multiplication of any two integers can always be reduced to or thought of or defined by repeated addition problem without recourse to multiplication or its inverse division i certainly could be wrong but it seems to me there are two choices if you actually want to
2266086 movements of plane figures that do not alter the shape or size of the figures
2266087 i t does not suffice merely to assert that the two multiplication and repeated addition are for the most part not the same
2266088 look i learned it as repeated addition my kid gets it as repeated addition i did fine in math my kid is doing well in math whats the problem
2266089 doesnt matter wrong is wrong please rewrite it and have it on my desk tomorrow morning
2266090 but kids arent going to get that lets leave it
2266091 maybe comic books arent just for teenage boys with pimples on their faces maybe this graphic novel is the real deal
2266092 he offers fiercely funny and often inebriated scottish fairies a poignant love story as well as insights into the gravity of crohns disease cultural conflicts and the plight of the homeless in this fey urban fantasy
2266093 ask something of me and i will give it to you
2266094 o lord my god you have made me your servant king to succeed my father david but i am a mere youth not knowing at all how to act i serve you in the midst of the people whom you have chosen a people so vast that it cannot be numbered or counted give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people and to distinguish right from wrong for who is able to govern this vast people of yours
2266095 because you have asked for this not for a long life for yourself nor for riches nor for the life of your enemies but for understanding so that you may know what is right i do as you requested i give you a heart so wise and understanding that there has never been anyone like you up to now and after you there will come no one to equal you
2266096 the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in a field
2266097 then every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the head of a household who brings from his storeroom both the new and the old
2266098 its nanas turn wheres nanas toy nana go outside too i nana mommy
2266099 please mom if you just let me go to the movies tonight i promise ill clean my room first thing tomorrow
2266100 doubt is the vestibule through which all must pass before they can enter into the temple of wisdom
2266101 cherish your doubts for doubt is the handmaiden of truth doubt is the key to the door of knowledge it is the servant of discovery a belief which may not be questioned binds us to error for there is incompleteness and imperfection in every belief
2266102 the whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves but wiser people so full of doubts
2266103 unless i see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side i will not believe
2266104 put your finger here and see my hands reach out your hand and put it in my side
2266105 slight momentary affliction that is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen for what can be seen is temporary but what cannot be seen is eternal
2266106 it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye
2266107 blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe
2266108 i myself am made entirely of flaws stitched together with good intentions
2266109 if prices are favorable the fire department board of trustees will want to move forward immediately
2266110 weve known for a while that we need a satellite to better serve the high population in prestbury
2266111 we want a response time no longer than six minutes weve had some responses in those areas that took longer than six minutes
2266112 well have a geothermal system that takes cool air from underground during the summer and warm air during the winter well also have a cistern that will collect rain water off the roof to use for fighting fires and to wash the trucks
2266113 with gas prices at record levels and airlines struggling to survive there is clearly no money from the airlines the federal government or taxpayers to finance this plan if chicago cannot prove there is an adequate funding mechanism bulldozing our town will be a wasteful unnecessary and cruel burden on the people of bensenville
2266114 i implore the court to block all demolition work in bensenville until chicago proves definitively how it will pay for the airport expansion
2266115 decisions this important must be based on the merits of the case not simply on legal technicalities
2266116 this is a ruling on whether or not the children and people of bensenville will be protected from cancer causing toxic materials we will not allow bensenville children to be put in harms way without ensuring every necessary measure is taken to prevent long term health risks
2266117 chicagos claim that it will prevent the spread of toxins into bensenvilles neighborhoods through a process known as water spray is inadequate and without data or testing to back it up
2266118 im 83 years old ive lived here most of my life
2266119 our streets are already becoming desolate and unlivable ive got asthma but im not just worried about myself there are senior centers playgrounds and day care facilities directly in harms way of the toxic chemicals that this demolition will release its unconscionable
2266120 why destroy an entire neighborhood for a project you are never going to build
2266121 even if some magical outside source offered to advance the billions the airlines would have to pay for use of these facilities to pay off the debt
2266122 imposing these massive multi billion dollar costs on airlines in dire financial straits is sheer financial folly
2266123 it would allow us to go after drivers that are way over the speed limit
2266124 it is not like some guy going 7 or 10 miles over
2266125 managing organizational change hrs greatest opportunity in the 21st century

2266127 finally learned to sidestep that unanswerable what is it question
2266128 please stop telling your pupils that multiplication is repeated addition
2266129 amys mum is making 2 pots of tomato soup she wants to put 3 tomatoes in each pot of soup how many tomatoes does she need
2266130 the objective of spammers is to make you curious enough to look and they always pick up on topical events
2266131 we put the challenge out there and bag manufacturers overwhelming responded with innovative products that provide a win win for travelers and tsa
2266132 given tsas use of random screening protocols tsa reserves the right to re screen any bag or laptop regardless of the design of the bag
2266133 angelina jolie for example is unknowingly luring many to eagerly install trojans onto their pcs
2266134 is it that crazy to think britney actually did send me this e mail
2266135 sure wed open an office and expand if we won a big contract government customers want reliable suppliers with established track records some contracts explicitly require vendors to show a couple years commercial track record in order to be considered

2266138 if you own a first generation 2g iphone no matter what you do now you dont have to worry the next pwnagetool will get you where you want even if it you prematurely updated 2g is completely pwned at every conceivable level and youll always be ok but if you own a 3g iphone and are looking for unlock in the near future dont use apples update yet
2266139 i think thats the coolest thing ive ever seen cuz look it looks like a person it really does a child right
2266140 some folks have described it as the shape of a child someone else said it looks like it takes a few steps
2266141 look at the shadow on the floor coming from those lights
2266142 im a logical person and i wanted to be able to explain to these folks or anybody this is what i think it is its a bat flying around here and it casts a shadow but then why is the shadow down here from a different angle and its not in the shape of a bat
2266143 its a ghost of course its a ghost its the ghost of some former student who is really angry with his teacher and has come back to get back with the teacher and hes just making himself known at this time
2266144 first collect the weeds and tie them in bundles for burning
2266145 the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened
2266146 explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field
2266147 he who sows good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed the children of the kingdom the weeds are the children of the evil one and the enemy who sows them is the devil the harvest is the end of the age and the harvesters are angels just as weeds are collected and burned up with fire so will it be at the end of the age the son of man will send his angels and they will collect out of his kingdom all who cause others to sin and all evildoers they will throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father whoever has ears ought to hear
2266148 that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president
2266149 we called her we pretty much straight up called she called back we told her our idea she was into it
2266150 why dont we have a hybrid of both candidates ideas
2266151 we considered the 40 pound cat was one we talked about the montauk sea creature was mentioned
2266152 if we cant manage to protect this kid she will be killed
2266153 our work with young victims would benefit from a constant policy to avoid the situation you just heard about
2266154 our naturalist guided field trips are fun interactive and full of natures serendipity
2266155 connecting kids to the natural world is what were all about
2266156 all of our programs are based on the motto through education understanding through understanding appreciation through appreciation protection
2266157 unfortunately we are the latest victim of our sad economic times
2266158 where the girls are the facts about gender equity in education
2266159 just having these prominent people from all over the world in our little town is amazing
2266160 one of the best things about it was we didnt have to drive we went with a group of about 10 in a limousine that left from the marklund campus in geneva
2266161 we had trouble getting volunteers last year so we outsourced the work and that cost us part of the proceeds
2266162 this year we started recruiting in february we have more knowledge now about making it work better
2266163 clerics can wear any armor clerics may not use magic weapons
2266164 unfortunately house speaker mike madigan has decided to oppose every initiative we propose
2266165 what are you supposed to do to do right by the people
2266166 they kill jobs they kill education funding they try and take away health care from people
2266167 now the governor by doing this risks us not getting anything at all
2266168 many of us are getting sick and tired of this little game it is hurting people
2266169 get to work stop making excuses and earn your pay
2266170 were doing what we can to find out what happened to it it doesnt appear that there was anything done purposefully
2266171 we have our own issues with the blood but were adding the fact that they didnt preserve the evidence as a reason the blood should not be admissible at trial
2266172 in this case there are multiple issues with the blood draw not the least of which is it has gone missing
2266173 with tick bourne illnesses they can happen anywhere at anytime
2266174 this can happen in your own backyard which apparently happened to this individual
2266175 heh maybe my friend will buy me the pair of shoes instead since hed scoffed at the thought of me provisioning it

2266178 128 pages so definitively short and a classic but rather english humour
2266179 i dont know if weve ever had an australian book in the club how about one written by an aboriginal ive not read it but i am keen to check it out i just checked amazon and it appears that this book isnt released in the uk yet so maybe we put it on a backburner for the last quarter of the year
2266180 the first 40 pages of goulds notebook are missing his journal begins on page 41
2266181 that the world did not correspond to anything he had read

2266478 milhares de angolanos ter o morrido nessa revolta s o her is que criaram os alicerces para que outros movimentos se constitu ssem para a contesta o da coloniza o em angola
2266479 o facto de terem morrido mais pessoas no 4 de janeiro n o o torna mais importante do que o 4 de fevereiro ataque a cadeias em luanda desencadeado por nacionalistas e tido como o primeiro passo da luta armada mas sim por ser um marco de refer ncia hist rica da ocupa o colonial que fez os portugueses compreenderem que teriam que engendrar outras formas para continuarem em angola
2266480 com a evolu o da ind stria europeia particularizando a economia portuguesa portugal em posse do territ rio angolano tudo fez para facilitar as suas obras fazendo com que as popula es nativas n o tivessem nenhuma relut ncia para o prosseguimento dos seus interesses
2266481 a expropria o de terras foi um dos mecanismos utilizados pelos portugueses para facilitar a implementa o dos seus projectos e a baixa de cassanje foi dada para a produ o de algod o e explora o de diamantes
2266482 esta obrigatoriedade da produ o de algod o espoletou o dio entre as popula es africanas numa altura em que muitos estados africanos sob domina o colonial tinham j obtido a sua independ ncia influenciando bastante a atitude dos angolanos
2266483 a passagem pela regi o de alguns belgas fugidos do congo veio facilitar a consciencializa o pol tica dessas popula es para a adop o de uma postura violenta de contesta o mesmo com a camuflagem que a pide tentava fazer para esconder o que se estava a passar no vizinho congo
2266484 ter sido tamb m por essa influ ncia do congo e de alguns movimentos nacionais j constitu dos que se deu a revolta dos camponeses da baixa de cassanje em 4 de janeiro de 1961 que culminou com a morte de milhares de angolanos bombardeados pela for a a rea portuguesa
2266485 o 4 de janeiro uma continua o de outras resist ncias foi a resposta mais violenta ao sistema colonial em que se levantaram milhares de camponeses contra o sistema de explora o colonial na baixa de cassanje
2266486 o que se conhecia sobre o que ocorreu na baixa de cassanje era uma simples reivindica o de agricultores de algod o que pretendiam obter pre os mais elevados do seu produto mas a companhia compradora rejeitou desembocando no levantamento que culminou na morte de centenas de pessoas
2266487 um levantamento que se enquadrou na luta clandestina que ent o eclodia em angola
2266488 entre aqueles trabalhadores haviam elementos activos que estiveram na base das manifesta es embora tivesse um desfecho infeliz com a morte de centenas de nacionalistas este momento marcou decisivamente a luta dos angolanos pela independ ncia

2266649 saudi arabia has the largest number of filipino workers 1 019 577 outside the philippines in 2006 alone the kingdom recruited more than 223 000 workers from the philippines and their numbers are still increasing filipinos not only play an important and effective role in the kingdom they also perform different jobs in countries across the world including working as sailors they are known for their professionalism and the quality of their work
2266650 nobody here can think of a life without filipinos who make up around 20 percent of the worlds seafarers there are 1 2 million filipino sailors so if filipinos decided one day to stop working or go on strike for any reason who would transport oil food and heavy equipment across the world we can only imagine the disaster that would happen
2266651 what makes filipinos unique is their ability to speak very good english and the technical training they receive in the early stages of their education there are several specialized training institutes in the philippines including those specializing in engineering and road maintenance this training background makes them highly competent in these vital areas
2266652 when speaking about the philippines we should not forget filipino nurses they are some 23 percent of the worlds total number of nurses the philippines is home to over 190 accredited nursing colleges and institutes from which some 9 000 nurses graduate each year many of them work abroad in countries such as the us the uk saudi arabia the united arab emirates kuwait and singapore

2266656 you dont understand just how much these people hate you mr warden they mean to kill you
2266657 we spoke with kathy robinson for 2 hours she told us what we could do
2266658 for the past 25 years the business of pima county and tucson has been the importation and exploitation of illegal alien mexicans and for 25 years business has been good
2266659 someday federal agents are going to surround your building come into your office and arrest you
2266660 on the issue of illegal immigration there is a concert of action between the tucson city council legal defender isabel garcia and rich contractors to import illegal mexican aliens exploit their labor and exploit their votes
2266661 especially if they are contrary to mine we want to hear the left wing explain just why we need to keep importing and exploiting mexicos poor
2266662 municipal court judges dont have the authority to silence political speech
2266663 youre going up on charges for failure to protect us
2266664 i stand up in support of zapatas dream mexico oppresses its poor i burn the mexican flag in support of mexicos poor
2266665 take off that gun you pussy white faggot and step out here and we will take care of you
2266666 and a host of expletives so vile and so disgusting that a proper sense of decorum inhibits petitioner from setting them forth here
2266667 he spit on me go arrest him hop to it boy
2266668 for the past 25 years you people and your predecessors have loaded up this county and loaded up this country with illegal mexican aliens youve done it for money and for votes and now its all coming to a head

2266671 you probably will be arrested if you return to address the tucson city council
2266672 i t has come to our attention that the defendant recently addressed the city council
2266673 according to a story by lourdes medrano and dale quinn in wednesdays star some 2 500 tucsonans marched in favor of reforming the nations broken immigration laws counterprotestors numbered about half a dozen
2266674 the tucson showing was a high point for anti immigration forces
2266675 if more people truly feel it is in the best interest of this country to deport all illegal immigrants and greatly increase border security then more counter protestors would have gone out to blunt the message of those in favor of immigration reform
2266676 any question regarding infringement of first amendment rights is of the utmost gravity and importance for it goes to the heart of the natural rights of citizens to impart and acquire information which is necessary for the well being of a free society since an informed public is the most important of all restraints upon misgovernment the government may not take any action which might prevent free and general discussion of public matters as seems essential to prepare the people for an intelligent exercise of their rights as citizens
2266677 if two or more persons conspire to injure oppress threaten or intimidate any person in any state territory commonwealth possession or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the constitution or laws of the united states or because of his having so exercised the same t hey shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years or both

2266679 as chief justice hughes wrote in de jonge v oregon 299 us 353 365 260 it is only through free debate and free exchange of ideas that government remains responsive to the will of the people and peaceful change is effected the right to speak freely and to promote diversity of ideas and programs is therefore one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes

2266688 in the first film i had to fight against the suit all the time when i was doing the fight sequences this one was actually more compatible
2266689 it was heavier than the original suit but there was so much more motion also it didnt squeeze my head like a vice so this time i had to act the rage and anger
2266690 i dont mean this in a disrespectful way christian is very private he is quite intense and very private in the way he works
2266691 it was more fun hanging out with heath because heath died people want the dark story in between takes he would sit on the curbside smoke a cigarette laugh and talk about his daughter matilda
2266692 i have always liked the opportunities acting afforded even if i kind of lost enjoyment now and then with the actual acting
2266693 probably i wouldnt be here today without empire of the sun but starting at such a young age is not ideal i wouldnt recommend it for anyone
2266694 beijing 2008 the official video game of the olympic games
2266695 to be with these other athletes who are on the cover with me now i can cheer and watch them at the olympics and then go home and play the video game
2266696 i played the old nintendo olympics game with the power pad where you started out as the turtle and worked your way up to the cheetah
2266697 my family would have competitions against other families who were close friends and wed rock it wed do the triple jump and the hurdles and all of that fun stuff
2266698 like every guy its a major part of my life especially when you travel overseas
2266699 all the guys i know bring a ps2 psp and a controller with them to the international competitions they get into some pretty heated madden tournaments
2266700 olympic track athletes spend a lot of free time trying to be the best in their favorite video games so much so our fingers sometimes get more tired then our legs do in actual races
2266701 beijing 2008 gives kids a chance to experience the fun of being in the olympics when they are sitting right in their own home
2266702 maybe some young kid will play the game and be inspired to go out and train in real life with the goal of really being in the olympic games some day
2266703 i think a lot of people are watching to see whether we will succeed
2266704 if we can do something they havent been able to do up to this point they may follow suit
2266705 if we can feel the love from the fans i would say its o k to leave it
2266706 theyd look at us look around and then say check out the fan subtitles on youtube
2266707 were starting with youtube to show that it can be done
2266708 and the whole heath ledger thing we heard that he was amazing and thats a big part of why we wanted to come

2266713 maddenpalooza a games and music festival will take place on august 11th in pasadena and approximately 10 000 fans are expected at the stadium to get their hands on the game and hear bands like good charlotte play
2266714 it seems like every year madden gets more and more realistic
2266715 when i watch someone playing madden its like im watching a real nfl game the guys look so realistic and the features keep getting better
2266716 madden does give you a feel for who some of the good players are
2266717 the ratings and the rankings are pretty accurate you may know from playing madden that i need to watch out for that guy
2266718 i know with tennessee last year id actually play the video game before going to the field
2266719 its good to be able to know the players youre going to be playing against playing the video game was part of my preparation
2266720 theyre going to really have fun with this game because theyre going to be able to explore the ins and outs and the behind the scenes stuff
2266721 a good woman inspires a man a brillant woman interests him a beautiful woman fascinates him and a sympathetic woman gets him
2266722 there are people who think that honesty is always the best policy this is a superstition there are times when the appearance of it is worth six of it
2266723 lindsay loves it it was nervewracking to hear from her because shes so hugely successful so i was like no dont listen to it i ran out of the room when she listened to it shes really proud of me

2266726 a major limitation in the current version is that if you have multiple tags separated by commas the application doesnt break them up and allow you to filter by them that means your images can only have one tag associated with them dont worry i will fix that shortly
2266727 a bbc report said that when mr paek was asked why north korea had not explained earlier he told mr rammell that pyongyang had not done so because all foreign journalists were liars

2266737 to see what is in front of ones nose requires a constant struggle
2266738 the dsm is more a political document than a scientific one decisions regarding inclusion or exclusion of disorders are made by majority vote rather than by indisputable scientific data
2266739 we do not know the causes of psychiatric disorders we dont have methods of curing these illnesses yet
2266740 the timewhen psychiatrists considered that they could cure the mentally ill is gone in the future the mentally ill will have to learn to live with their illness
2266741 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
2266742 even the most ardent ritalin adhd enthusiasts find absolutely no positive long term outcomes on anything in their research reviews the widespread drugging of these children is a fraud
2266743 whether a sexual predator is on the internet exploiting our virtual borders or is an alien who has preyed on children ice is using all of its law enforcement authorities to identify them and bring them to justice
2266744 we are working with our law enforcement partners to do everything possible to prevent the exploitation of children both here and abroad
2266745 to see what is in front of ones nose requires a constant struggle
2266746 to see what is in front of ones nose requires a constant struggle
2266747 i dont think the public is aware of how egregious the financial ties are in the field of psychiatry
2266748 to see what is in front of ones nose requires a constant struggle

2266751 i have spent a lot of time with the children and i think i now know each of them by their first name children are our future and for that reason i have tried to inspire them
2266752 all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages
2266753 oh thats just because pete doesnt face the competition that lendl mcenroe connors borg newcombe laver etc faced they would just say pete is the greatest
2266754 pete sampras definitely had tougher opponents back then roger federer is a great player no doubt about that but he didnt have multiple grand slam winners to compete with
2266755 but watching federer play even before he wins 14 titles i can safely annoint him the best ever i play competitive tennis and i know what im talking about some shots which he makes ive never seen anybody make before my jaw just drops i cant say the same for sampras
2266756 it is a little frustrating because im a better player now than i was when i was no 1 in the world
2266757 there are a lot of characters to keep up with
2266758 i know we were only going to talk about the first seven pages but i had to read the whole thing
2266759 i like her shes wry and funny shes somebody you want to be friends with

2266761 between 1958 and 1992 russia dumped 18 nuclear reactors into the arctic ocean several of them still fully loaded with nuclear fuel
2266762 f or the first time the northwest passage a fabled sea route to asia that european explorers sought in vain for centuries opened for shipping
2266763 yes but its a wine shop we wouldnt find much of interest in there

2266771 the movie reminds us that our times are a pale reflection of what our grandparents went through
2266772 as comic fans weve known since we were little kids how great comics are with this game we have the opportunity to show everyone else how cool the dc universe is
2266773 if we have a big storyline happening in the summer you might see that in the game later i have a staff position at dc and we have a short list of characters that well update first in the game and then in the comics
2266774 the biggest fantasy players can have is to be an equal of superman not necessarily to play as superman
2266775 when you pick up a bus and throw it across metropolis hundreds of thousands of players will be able to see this and many of them will have to dodge this projectile for their safety
2266776 comic con is now an entertainment event and comics have proven themselves as mainstream entertainment across multiple mediums
2266777 if youre an everyday fan its pretty hard to buy a toy or look at a comic book
2266778 the main rooms are so jam packed its hard to fight your way through them
2266779 it can be stifling and smelly its not as much fun as it was before the studios and networks decided they needed to be there every day
2266780 for certain kinds of movies its as important as sundance or cannes
2266781 that can make it nerve racking but nothing feels better than having a good presentation before these fans which is why i think so many people show up regardless of genre
2266782 not only are we democratizing game development with xbox live community games later this year but were creating an opportunity for aspiring developers
2266783 i am glad we started filming the movie before we came here if we were starting tomorrow after this i would be like i cant satisfy that they want too much they love us too much lets quit
2266784 it became a cultural thing that took on a life of its own there arent many shows period that do that what shows do that
2266785 you have to create in a vacuum of what is good once you start thinking about what is going to be the impact or how your character is going to come across then you are not really coming from a truthful place
2266786 it is really a hot genre thats bringing in families and people that never played games before
2266787 the x files i cant believe this is what they came up with
2266788 sometimes with these big show runners its all hype and no delivery i actually am very happy to say that this one is going to deliver the goods
2266789 its like if you expect something thats going to change your life you know no matter what it is its almost invariably going to be disappointing
2266790 with the attention the show is getting we cant hide behind oh fox didnt promote it
2266791 its no one but us its our fault if it doesnt work
2266792 were trying very diligently to do a show that doesnt require the kind of insane absolute dedication to a series that if you miss an episode you truly have no idea whats going on
2266793 plays it all the time and i probably watched him play more than i should its got a story line more complex than most video game movies
2266794 can we deliver to our fiercely loyal fans and at the same time continue to transform the industry by delivering to everyone
2266795 games are now the leading driver of all entertainment spending
2266796 the games business is the cornerstone of microsofts home and entertainment strategy
2266797 microsoft wants to turn consumers into as big and well developed a market as they have with big companies
2266798 the hard core enthusiast gamers who are going to buy a console have their xbox 360
2266799 we dont have a swimming pool so mom and dad can come in and put the kids on the wii while they work out here
2266800 this is the part that tends to be a little off because people tend to put in the wrong year they were born
2266801 im interested in monsters because much like archangels and angels they represent a portion of the human soul
2266802 the fairies and the monsters have a humanity that is much more the stuff we should aspire to
2266803 in adult movies r rated movies monsters can signify many different things
2266804 but in the pg 13 hellboy mythology they symbolize our imperfections and how we can embrace them if we were more eager and willing to accept otherness things would be better between people
2266805 all we freaks have is each other thats the story of our lives
2266806 it was a lot of catholic scare about sin and hell
2266807 im eager to explore themes that lend themselves easily to metaphor
2266808 the fantastic is the only tool we have nowadays to explain spirituality to a generation that refuses to believe in dogma or religion superhero movies create a kind of mythology creature movies horror movies create at least a belief in something beyond
2266809 his creatures seem really different from us and really scary but they might not be really scary they just look different and act weird but they could also be our friends or actually be cooler than us
2266810 if i didnt feel it jibe with the universe im in i would do something else i have a pretty good record of turning things down no reason to break that now
2266811 it will be the same landscape but painted by another painter then the second movie will evolve into a perfect blending with the trilogy
2266812 bilbo represents a generation of english young men who went to world war i and saw their souls in danger if not lost
2266813 that is a very important theme that im attracted to a character with an unerring ethical sense thrown out into a world full of pride and greed and madness and makes it there and back the ethics and the fate and the character will be tested at the end of the day there will be a tragic sense of loss but there will be the survival of that temperament and belief
2266814 people tend to think that big things only happen to big people
2266815 that 11 year old girl is powerless that 12 year old kid is a nincompoop the great quests the great decisions only happen to great people i think that is not true the small decisions we make every day define who we are and define the world around us im interested in the essential importance of the small decision you can be a cashier at a 7 11 or you can be the person at the kentucky fried chicken counter but i bet to you there is a decision every day in your life where you affect somebody else i bet that is true
2266816 frankenstein is ultimately a very existential creature thrown into the world by an uncaring creator it voices the essential plea of mankind asking god why am i here what is my purpose beyond any religion its a question mankind has voiced forever
2266817 i would love to do the origin but that is not a movie that is a miniseries
2266818 a chronicle of the end of the world from the eyes of a 7 year old it has many things that are magical and terrible in it its the rapture
2266819 you really dont know whats in a banks or insurance companys portfolio until after the fact
2266820 in markets that are very strong and are running very rapidly we likely will tend to lag
2266821 that will allow them to do well regardless of whats going on in the environment around them
2266822 were really trying to understand what makes the company tick in more detail than what you could get from a phone call
2266823 when he left i was surprised because he was very well respected at the company and we thought very highly of him
2266824 so i called him up and tried to understand what it was that he saw at rsc
2266825 having the exclusive mobile game available just weeks before the launch of one of summers most anticipated films is a great opportunity for us
2266826 the death race mobile game offers fans a great way to experience their favorite film both before and after its debut by adding an intense interactive component to the movie
2266827 we have an exceptional collaborative relationship with gameloft and we continue to be impressed by the high quality graphically rich mobile games they produce from our films
2266828 the death race storyline is inherently game ready and we believe that a lot of the films fans will be gamers who will love gamelofts mobile game

2266832 the round that was fired at the security officer went into the building just 2 feet above his head
2266833 it was a dumb move for me to do that to dump his body but i didnt know what to do
2266834 the los angeles county district attorney declined to prosecute for that incident
2266835 i thought a felon with a gun this isnt good
2266836 he was paralyzed he knew it he said he didnt want to live like that so i took him out and laid him under the stars like he wanted
2266837 if he hadnt turned on me i probably wouldnt have shot him
2266838 the obvious thing that needs to be decided is if this is a justifiable homicide
2266839 obviously these residents here do have a right to protect themselves
2266840 we dont have that type a crime in this area so its very unusual
2266841 that was the most exciting thing that ever happened here
2266842 i tell everybody i live in the safest part of the valley ever my kids grew up here i walk here every night man walking with wife shoots mountain lion near new castle
2266843 the husband was carrying a firearm and he shot and killed the lion as it got really close
2266844 somewhere in the middle of the robbery mr rodriguez was shot
2266845 my understanding is that hes in surgery and will recover
2266846 he works every day trying to take care of the family without him i dont know what to do
2266847 you really dont know whats in a banks or insurance companys portfolio until after the fact
2266848 in markets that are very strong and are running very rapidly we likely will tend to lag
2266849 that will allow them to do well regardless of whats going on in the environment around them
2266850 were really trying to understand what makes the company tick in more detail than what you could get from a phone call
2266851 when he left i was surprised because he was very well respected at the company and we thought very highly of him

2266860 i was raised by parents who didnt have much we didnt use whole pieces of paper towel we shared or used rags mom didnt even want us flushing all the time
2266861 think about what this whole culture of celebrity has done to movie stars its made them extinct actors used to carry films because people would have to actually go to the movies to see them it was the only place but now theres none of that mystique and so theres less of a reason to buy a ticket
2266862 i got a letter saying i need something from the court before theyll process anything and i didnt get that before so now i have to go back to my attorney
2266863 britney is desperate for some female companionship shes tired of being stuck in the house all the time and having her father tag along everywhere

2266867 lindsay who was wearing the same shirt that sam wore the day before sat in a chair in the deejay booth right next to her and watched her spin they were very affectionate to one another
2266868 lindsay sat around smiling and talking with friends she was having a great time

2266899 brown fell on top of an iron stove he got up and the two men continued to harass him he went back to the couch where he was sleeping and pulled out a pistol
2266900 hooten jumped on brown and started choking him when he felt like he was going to pass out he fired a shot hitting hooten in the abdomen
2266901 gadberry went outside too hooten was taken by helicopter to the white county medical center in searcy he underwent a successful surgery
2266902 hooten will be charged upon his release from the hospital
2266903 whether or not this is one of those cases we dont know
2266904 the victim stated that when he became physically tired from holding the door he became fearful for his and his wifes lives
2266905 he said i knew the guy was going to eventually overcome me
2266906 he comes in the room and says i want your wallet and your cash
2266907 he is there to protect his residence protect the business under the direction of the owner
2266908 thats against the law she lied to us from the onset of the investigation thats against the law
2266909 you cant prepare for someone to come in and knock the whole front door into the building
2266910 they stole a truck next door came in here and ran it through the door they hit it about three times first time got it in midway then they got the truck completely through the building they came to steal the atm
2266911 i heard this loud excruciatingly loud bang across the street
2266912 i got my gun out of my gun cabinet and told my wife to call 911 i walked outside and fired a shot in the air just to ruffle their feathers
2266913 he pulled out and faced me the truck did i felt at that point im in imminent danger and it scared me i fired a slug through the windshield of his truck and put one in the grill and passenger side door
2266914 you dont expect it in smaller towns like we have we have seen it on tv of course but you just deal with what happens
2266915 we all have a right to come to work to do our time and go home to our families
2266916 and nobody has a right to take that away from us
2266917 and i can only hope that i would have been as lucky and as fortunate had it been me
2266918 they gave my manager a split second to defend himself and he did
2266919 it should show criminals that you may get away with things for a while but its going to catch up to you
2266920 obviously in cases where you have a gun involved it increases the stakes
2266921 its expletive when you cant leave your front door open
2266922 one guy opened up the garage let the van in and then they started going upstairs
2266923 one of the guys kicked the door in and then he started going through dantes stuff
2266924 thats when he came out of the closet and thats when he stabbed the guy in the stomach
2266925 i watch the news all the time and see this on the news all the time
2266926 you just never think that its going to happen to you but hey you cant ever rule yourself out
2266927 just to know that he is ok mentally and physically was just the most important part for me
2266928 it could have happened to anyone you can never say
2266929 i wouldnt want to walk into my house and see somebody in my house
2266930 the ironic part about it is the same time this was occuring we were doing a sting operation on the other side on raymond road another house burglary suspect that had been breaking into houses attempted to sell things
2266931 id just like to know who did it and thats what were working on
2266932 anytime you have a bullet in your body and youre bleeding thats not good

2266934 the virus does not last long if the host animal is dead
2266935 it is extremely dangerous for juveniles or anyone else to take part in armed robberies
2266936 there is always the possibility that the person being robbed is armed and that was the case in this instance juveniles should not have weapons in the first place
2266937 for him the security guard to defend himself this way he had to feel his life was in danger he once again he was a vietnam vet so hes had to deal with weapons and things before im sure this was a life threatening situation to him
2266938 he came back in and said we gotta call 911
2266939 there was a man standing in the middle of the street and a lady screaming you blanking killed him
2266940 as far as coming out with a gun he was well within his rights
2266941 he was in his yard he never left his property he came out with a gun which is his constitutional right
2266942 first i tried to point it up in his face so that he would see that i had a gun so he would take off running
2266943 one of the employees saw two individuals in the parking lot changing clothes and putting on masks
2266944 there have been some cases where this store has been robbed
2266945 the suspects who came to the home apparently did not know that the home was occupied
2266946 the victim confronted the suspects and shot both of them
2266947 i heard commotion right and i stepped outside and i see a cop telling the owner of the house to put the gun down
2266948 he got shot in the back but he was able to beat the attacker down with a bat or something
2266949 he would speak to you but mostly he stayed over on his property
2266950 he came home to check on his daughter when he discovered the window broken out of his house so he armed himself with his handgun and checked the house where he was confronted
2266951 you have to make a good film that would be a good film under any circumstances
2266952 you have to put the narrative first the reality is no matter how many 3 d screens we get you are still going to have a large number of people possibly the majority of people who see the film in a 2 d environment
2266953 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight falcon 1 flight 3
2266954 the legend of nostradamus faulty as it is will survive it all not because of its worth but because of its seductive attraction the idea that the prophet of salon could see into the future will persist an ever abundant number of interpreters will pop up to renew the shabby exterior of his image and that gloss will serve to entice more unwary fans into acceptance of the false predictions that have enthralled millions in the centuries since his death shameless rationalizations will be made ugly facts will be ignored and common sense will continue to be submerged in enthusiasm
2266955 sam came and visited and she was great she just hung out with us just palled around with us and watched the goings on they seem to have a really nice trust with one another
2266956 i didnt see a lot of their interaction sam just sort of watched the scene and then they would go back to hair and makeup or to her lindsays trailer or to lunch
2266957 but no they definitely seem to have a really nice comfortable relationship where theres a lot of trust thats hard to find
2266958 michael thinks lindsay is just going through another phase and that she will end up getting hurt he thinks it is embarrassing

2267001 if you are the son of god command these stones to become loaves of bread
2267002 it is written one does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god
2267003 if you are the son of god throw yourself down for it is written he will command his angels concerning you and on their hands they will bear you up so that you will not dash your foot against a stone
2267004 again it is written do not put the lord your god to the test
2267005 all these i will give you if you will fall down and worship me
2267006 no testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone
2267007 if you are the son of god command these stones to become loaves of bread
2267008 it is written one does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god
2267009 if you are the son of god throw yourself down for it is written he will command his angels concerning you and on their hands they will bear you up so that you will not dash your foot against a stone
2267010 again it is written do not put the lord your god to the test
2267011 the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor and he said to him
2267012 then the devil left him and suddenly angels came and waited on him
2267013 lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
2267014 the city should do everything in its power to make sure this piece is installed
2267015 the work is significant and would be a major contribution to the public art collection of phoenix people shouldnt be afraid of it but welcome it
2267016 if you dont at least have a good guess perhaps you shouldnt be calling this number
2267017 youre the guy who wrote the letter in the weekly fourth item on the page suggesting we call tim bees campaign if we got stuck east of swan

2267019 thats hilarious i couldnt get home and i was very upset so i saw your letter and i called them up the lady who answered gave me your number i asked what it was for then she screamed it at me again and hung up
2267020 s o muitos os homens que amam ideais nobres e elevados e se calam com receio de serem considerados diferentes

2267028 service will continue to be lousy until hein caves in you cant just get rid of us and hire a new police force and you want to be safe right
2267029 we raised police pay just because they asked had we negotiated and compromised youd be getting more for your taxes
2267030 how is it that you a jew ask a drink of me a woman of samaria
2267031 if you knew the gift of god and who it is that is saying to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water
2267032 sir you have no bucket and the well is deep where do you get that living water are you greater than our ancestor jacob who gave us the well and with his sons and his flocks drank from it
2267033 everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again but those who drink of the water that i will give them will never be thirsty the water that i will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life
2267034 sir give me this water so that i may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water
2267035 you are right in saying i have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband what you have said is true
2267036 sir i see that you are a prophet our ancestors worshiped on this mountain but you say that the place where people must worship is in jerusalem
2267037 woman believe me the hour is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem you worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the jews but the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father seeks such as these to worship him god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth
2267038 when he comes he will proclaim all things to us
2267039 i am he the one who is speaking to you
2267040 come and see a man who told me everything i have ever done he cannot be the messiah can he
2267041 i have food to eat that you do not know about
2267042 my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work do you not say four months more then comes the harvest but i tell you look around you and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting the reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life so that sower and reaper may rejoice together for here the saying holds true one sows and another reaps i sent you to reap that for which you did not labor others have labored and you have entered into their labor
2267043 it is no longer because of what you said that we believe for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this is truly the savior of the world

2267051 o fmi exaltou o retrospecto altamente positivo do governo brasileiro na condu o da pol tica econ mica um fator que aliado s condi es externas extremamente favor veis nos ltimos anos deu grande impulso ao desempenho econ mico do brasil e aumentou a resist ncia do pa s a choques externos adversos
2267052 o brasil encontra se hoje numa posi o muito mais s lida do que no passado para enfrentar a deteriora o da conjuntura externa
2267053 a pobreza e a desigualdade tamb m diminu ram resultado das s lidas pol ticas sociais
2267054 al m disso um dos pilares da pol tica macroecon mica do governo tem sido a nfase das autoridades no crescimento mais elevado e sustent vel com o respaldo do pac programa de acelera o do crescimento
2267055 o impacto inicial da alta dos alimentos j come a a se espalhar para outros bens e servi os o n cleo da infla o subiu de 3 4 h um ano para 5 4 em junho
2267056 o volume de importa es continuou a crescer acima de 10 enquanto as exporta es cresceram de forma mais lenta e as remessas para o exterior subiram em parte como conseq ncia do aumento do investimento estrangeiro direto nos ltimos anos
2267057 a entrada l quida de capital totalizou quase 7 do pib em 2007 com um n vel recorde us 35 bilh es cerca de 3 do pib em investimento estrangeiro direto a valoriza o do real em termos efetivos reais foi de 16 5 em 2007 sobretudo como reflexo do desempenho macroecon mico vigoroso do pa s no contexto das rela es de troca favor veis as reservas internacionais cresceram us 95 bilh es em 2007 totalizando us 201 bilh es no fim do primeiro semestre
2267058 pois as press es inflacion rias v o al m do que seria apenas efeito dos choques mundiais nos pre os das commodities e o saldo das contas externas apresentou uma r pida revers o de super vit para d ficit
2267059 um aperto das finan as p blicas contribuiria para o ajuste e ajudaria a aliviar a press o sobre a pol tica monet ria
2267060 por este motivo consideraram acertada a decis o das autoridades de adotar uma meta de super vit prim rio mais elevada em 2008 considerando que a conten o do crescimento dos gastos p blicos desde que se proteja o gasto em reas priorit rias seria essencial para reequilibrar as pol ticas macroecon micas
2267061 tamb m considerou se que a transpar ncia das opera es do fundo essencial para manter a confian a na pol tica macroecon mica inclusive na rea de opera es cambiais que deveria ser coordenada cuidadosamente com o banco central

2267135 in his view greek is a particularly good language to learn as it makes for very transparent prose words that leave little room for confusion or abstraction which is not to say that it is unsuited to metaphysics but that it is as a clear sky to philosophy and thought where german say is cloudy and opaque and french perhaps self regarding and more caught up in the sound of the language than the plausibility of the message an old maxim argues that to acquire another language is to acquire another soul but whatever about that its certainly true that another language does no harm for clarity of thought it wasnt elitism or nostalgia that led the british to run india with a handful of classics graduates but confidence in something that was picked up along with the languages its just a pity that so few people still study the classics in the original i wish i hadnt forgotten so much of it

2267162 dessv rre har du helt fel sd r ett missn jesparti som ensidigt beskyller allt p invandrare
2267163 vanligaste argumenten som invandrarfientliga och fr mlingsfientliga partier brukar f ra fram r att invandrare beg r fler brott n svenskar
2267164 och visst st mmer det att invandrare om vi med invandrare menar personer f dda utomlands och folkbokf rda i sverige r verrepresenterade i brottsstatistiken men fr gan om brottslighet r inte s enkel som den kan verka
2267165 ett intressant faktum som visar sig i statistiken r att verrepresentationen i brottsstatistiken mellan arbetare j mf rt med tj nstem n r betydligt st rre n verrepresentationen mellan invandrare och svenskar

2267276 my body may have not been strong but my faith was strong and the other contestants were starting to get it
2267277 i listened to the holy spirits promptings questions were asked but i didnt preach
2267278 when i said i believed jesus is the son of god i finally realized i didnt understand what belief meant
2267279 it is a firm conviction a full surrender and a lifestyle that reflects that surrender

2267329 my wife needed to get away from the madness that surrounds a coach in new york
2267330 we needed to get rid of the bad food that had been eaten and digested and get it totally out of our system
2267331 he said i have two thoughts why did it take me so long and now i know why i moved to boca raton that was very telling
2267332 it does and yet im grateful for it because if that didnt happen i wouldnt be where i am today i mightve made millions of dollars and become more famous or infamous but i wouldnt be where i am spiritually
2267333 matthew 5 14 had a lot to do with it and really just realizing that i am supposed to do the things ive been gifted to do
2267334 i think i was able to get a comfort level there
2267335 i dont think hes a risk to us in that regard i have confidence in him
2267336 he brings a tremendous amount of credibility to our program because he has been a very success coach at the highest level
2267337 from an xs and os standpoint i think he will be great with recruiting and graduation rates but the other thing helpful for us is his credibility in the community and his name recognition from an external standpoint selling tickets and attracting donors
2267338 theres nothing better than going into the coliseum as a gladiator and trying to come out alive
2267339 he just gives the glory to god and looks to god
2267340 im seeing him do what gods people are supposed to do and thats trusting god its good stuff
2267341 i want to let my light shine and share the passion i have for christ
2267342 go for the gold how to be a champion for god
2267343 because it is a global event you have the opportunity to touch the whole world all at once
2267344 in one minute youre speaking to one person from one country and the next youre speaking to another person from another country your witness has a lot of bang for the buck
2267345 usually people who are there to attend the olympics are very open to talking
2267346 one of our hopes with this particular olympics is that well have the opportunity to engage chinese people
2267347 the volunteers have to be aware of whats acceptable in the country
2267348 thats always an issue but i would say theres more to it this year
2267349 go for the gold how to be a champion for god
2267350 im going to actually highlight some of the unsung champions from the bible
2267351 everybody knows about david and goliath and daniel in the lions den
2267352 i just think people are interested enough in the olympics themselves
2267353 im always looking for opportunities to involve people who wouldnt ordinarily come to church
2267354 were happy for the chinese that they have the olympics because its a really big deal for them
2267355 we saw that it was kind of a once in a lifetime ministry because of the olympics coming up
2267356 we were using the olympics as a draw for people
2267357 once we met them and established a relationship with them then we would slowly start to share when the opportunity became available
2267358 if i was going to be there during the olympics i would feel a little more of a freedom of sharing my faith
2267359 the police are not going to be so much focusing on the christians as they are other groups that may use the olympics to undermine the government
2267360 there is a real evidence of the growth of the christian faith in china
2267361 going over to china on short term trips can really make an impact the relationships that you develop and the opportunities you have to share the gospel with the people who really are hungry theyre hungry for truth and they really are hungry for god
2267362 ill be involved in china probably until i go to heaven
2267363 and i want to take as many of those people with me as i can
2267364 in the true spirit of sportsmanship for the glory of sport and the honor of our teams
2267365 right now it is a very special beijing right now it is the greatest time in china
2267366 here in the city theres been a buzz its been exciting over the last two years to see how the citys grown and to see how theyve built new buildings for the olympics
2267367 i think the government and the people who relate to the olympics specifically are expecting china to have its coming out party these next few weeks
2267368 as a result of that i think it will put china on the world stage
2267369 i dont think id be where i am now without having the faith i have
2267370 i dont know that i would have been able to persevere without knowing that the lord was in control and he had his hand on me and was working through everything ive gone through
2267371 the americans havent won a medal in road cycling since 1984 so its been a long time
2267372 i think well come away disappointed if we dont win one
2267373 i think there were a lot of people praying for me at the time
2267374 i remember being an eighth grader and having a really good understanding of his grace and what it meant to be a christian
2267375 i think my faith was pretty far along pretty early
2267376 i knew there was something athletically special about what i could do but i kept getting hurt
2267377 i could never do enough miles to be competitive i walked to the other side of the track where the bleachers were i climbed to the top and sat there and cried for an hour and a half i sat in the cold i cried i prayed i sat in silence
2267378 all of a sudden you have a really clear understanding of what it means when jesus said to paul my grace is sufficient
2267379 at the time i was going through those four years it was such a roller coaster now when i look back im so thankful for it and i wouldnt change any of it because of how it built my faith and developed a foundation for me for who i am now
2267380 the people that knew me and had been around me knew that something had happened that i didnt do anything
2267381 my worry was more with the people who really didnt know me for me that was the hardest thing knowing that my witness was a little bit scarred in that sense but the people who knew me they knew my faith they knew my integrity and how i walked and that it was never something that i would intentionally do
2267382 i consider myself a christian before i consider myself an athlete
2267383 so how i act how i talk how i race i try to do that as a christian first im not going to put someone in the ditch i try to race with integrity and class i try to do things professionally in a way that hopefully accurately represents christ

2267388 this book can make you fall in love with economics all over again a collection of interviews with 16 eminent economists it presents the attractive face of the field one rediscovers an economics concerned with improving the human condition by putting to good use tools borrowed from disciplines as diverse as mathematics and psychology the book is a labour of love for william barnett the editor of the journal in which these interviews originally appeared between 1997 and 2005 though the interviews were aimed at professional macroeconomists much of the book is of broader interest that is because these eminent economists interviewed by their peers are often able to describe their complicated work in simple terms with modesty and humour and enriched with anecdotes from their lives

2267399 it is gratifying that batman begins is not about shades of grey at all but rather shades of white it is a film not about amorality and evil but good in many ways it is the film that zizek wanted revenge of the sith to be a film that is to say which dares to hypothesize that evil might result from an excess of good wayne is forced to decide is ras al ghul what he claims to be the ice cold instrument of impersonal justice or its grotesque parody the ultimate evil in the film turns out to originate from ghuls excessive zeal not from some hokey diabolism
2267400 you see nobody panics when things go according to plan even if the plan is horrifying if i told people that a gangbanger was going to get shot or a busload of soldiers was going to get blown up nobody would panic because its all part of the plan but tell people that one tiny little mayor is going to die and everyone loses their minds introduce a little anarchy you upset the established order and everything becomes chaos i am an agent of chaos and you know the thing about chaos harvey its fair

2267475 my only beef with dk is that it could be interpreted as an endorsement of redemptive violence
2267476 i can see where some folks have compared the bush administrations vision of america to batman someone has to do the dirty work so america shoulders this cross and takes out the bad guys alone the references to terrorism insurgency are not subtle in the film
2267477 in dk we never are presented with the christ option which is transformation of evil our enemy batman doesnt transform bad guys he brings them to justice hes still an old testament character despite his noble desire not to exactly repay an eye for eye
2267478 now i realize igniting inner repentance isnt the usual m o for comic book characters but if were going to discuss the christian parallels in dk which there are we must also discuss the elements that are missing
2267479 funny i liked iron man more than dk maybe because it had a little more hope in it
2267480 he has shown you o man what is good and what does the lord require of you but to do justice and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god

2267485 we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in peoples lives

2267493 and does the software do exactly what it claimed in the app store description
2267494 this religious tendency is not simply the result of successful marketing by skilled preachers or the draw of popular mega churches in fact it speaks to a hunger thats deeper than that a hunger that goes beyond any particular issue or cause
2267495 you need to embrace christ precisely because you have sins to wash away because you are human and need an ally in this difficult journey
2267496 but what i am suggesting is this secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square so to say that men and women should not inject their
2267497 a way that reconciles the beliefs of each with the good of all
2267498 so before we get carried away lets read our bibles folks havent been reading their bibles
2267499 i was usually exhausted by the time i went home
2267500 in fact i dont think this is the baby at all this is all that was sucked in before
2267501 our government spent vast sums of money fighting these cases when all logic dictated that they were wrong
2267502 while the immigrant council of ireland recognises legitimate concerns regarding marriages of convenience which may have been the reasoning behind the governments incorrect transposition of the free movement directive we are of the view that each application must be considered on its own merits
2267503 debating with liberals is like trying to play chess with a monkey
2267504 ongoing evaluation and review of cellarsensor operations and manufacturing has identified key cost savings that we are pleased to pass along to collectors cellarsensors new lower pricing will make cellarsensor attractive to virtually everyone who has a passion for collecting wine
2267505 cellarcentral has worked extensively over the past 18 months to refine and perfect the cellarsensor product and build key relationships in the fine wine industry
2267506 but be sure of one thing you will never fill them
2267507 you can call your primary care physician today with an acute illness but that doesnt necessarily mean youll be seen today or tomorrow or this week
2267508 were open to all kind of social categories but mainly to youth as they are less constrained by family responsibilities
2267509 czechs and irish people are very connected as far as mentality and lifestyle our common celtic roots make the integration much easier
2267510 people are coming in with smaller budgets but were trying to make the most of what they have to still give them a special experience and if that means losing 100 to 150 for us because of the cost of a better quality of meat thats okay for us
2267511 this is the time to prioritize what you need and realize that there is always something in your budget
2267512 shes so cute i just want to eat her up
2267513 i guess some people dont like traditional fruitcakes very much and perhaps have a real passion for cheese
2267514 it is a delicious thing to have at the end of a big feast rather than something sweet
2267515 the misinformation machine created by george washington was critical to the winning of the revolutionary war
2267516 gute sp tphase mit audioslave belanglosigkeit mit dem zweiten solo album dass es aber noch tiefer geht beweist der gute herr cornell dieser tage ein album mit timbaland klingt dann
2267517 drums and trumpets trombones and french horns cellos violas da gamba clarinets oboes and bassoons glass armonicas hammered dulcimers and organs
2267518 so is it true that because of that gig 3rd ward isnt having bands anymore
2267519 for us art here in south texas is unique in that it represents the texan culture as well as the mexican culture we are so privileged to live in a community that is so artistic and above all incredibly talented it is not often that people get to see works from all over north and central america that deal with topics and issues that people are familiar with but at our museum you can
2267520 if such is the case of a man with his wife it is not expedient to marry
2267521 and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven
2267522 he who is able to receive this let him receive it
2267523 he who is able to receive this let him receive it
2267524 as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren you did it to me
2267525 is a model of the church in the matter of faith charity and perfect union with christ
2267526 cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of self
2267527 i have brought a man into being with the help of the lord
2267528 i have brought a man into being with the help of the lord
2267529 there are more people arriving at the ers and there are fewer ers
2267530 it takes me a month to get an appointment for my own doctor and im a physician for gods sake
2267531 half of people had waiting times of 31 minutes or less
2267532 the er has become the front door to the hospital
2267533 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated
2267534 this report is very troubling because it shows that care is being delayed for everyone including people in pain and with heart attacks
2267535 that is why our use of transplant acceptance inducing cells taics in kidney transplant patients is such an exciting development as it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
2267536 although our use of taics is still in the preliminary stages the results of our clinical trials on 17 kidney transplant patients are promising
2267537 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
2267538 the beginning of studying thousands of diseases in a petri dish
2267539 deriving and quality assessing embryonic stem cells and ips cells is not a trivial task
2267540 wed like an open source model of distributing these agents all over the world
2267541 the hope is that this is an evergreen facility that will only become more valuable in the future
2267542 fluoride lowers thyroid function fluoride damages the bone and fluoride lowers iq all of these have been demonstrated in india and china
2267543 theyve brought together six top experts who have carefully looked at all of the details and they have come to a very clear result that there is not a link that would suggest fluoride is going to cause the problems that some people would suggest
2267544 the fluoride gets incorporated into the enamel of the tooth at the time that the tooth is forming so this makes a stronger coating on the tooth which is more resistant to decay right from the very start
2267545 the change has been large but not as large as people would have hoped
2267546 september probably wont be as good as august but it will be better than last september
2267547 im worried about potential breathing problems of olympic athletes and spectators
2267548 but im also worried about the cancers that the people who live there might be getting
2267549 i have had to take the advice of the medical experts and they are obviously correct ive had a great career in racing
2267550 its the news i didnt want but i have always respected medical opinion these people know best and i will accept their decision 100
2267551 i will be giving up riding with a lump in my throat because it is a game i have loved all of my life
2267552 but i will still be involved in the game in many capacities after all racing has always been in my blood
2267553 his greatest attribute to us was that he wasnt just a jockey he was a team player as far as we were concerned and a great mate his input was enormous
2267554 he obviously was a very very good rider he was very strong and very good at presenting a horse at an obstacle but there was much more to it than that
2267555 weve had a long association but it was very easy as he was always 100 and the owners knew that
2267556 we all became friends and it was easy to work and when you think he rode 762 winners for us which is an awful lot for one yard thats amazing
2267557 he was the archetypal stable jockey and his commitment was 100 to us he was always fully behind this operation and he would like to stay on in some capacity but at the moment he cant ride at all anyway
2267558 but he could always be here as a guide and helper and a brain he has always had the ability to work things out and the homework he did was phenomenal
2267559 he will be very sadly missed over the last 12 or 14 years he been one of my best friends on and off the course
2267560 he was a brilliant jockey good lad and a brilliant talker its sad but obviously after he broke his neck for the second time it was pretty obvious he would not be riding again i think
2267561 ibm is forging ahead in areas that signify major trends in information systems
2267562 second ibm is expanding its open source offering with a websphere version this might keep some software developer and users from trying open source alternatives such as jboss and finding that they scale well enough
2267563 finally ibms direct attack at micorosfts dominance on the desktop is partly a result of the evolution of web based versions of word processors spreadsheets etc from

2267569 protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes such as self defense within the home
2267570 why dont we do away with the court system and go back to the old west
2267571 no untouchable constitutional right guaranteed by the second amendment to keep loaded handguns in the house in crime ridden urban areas
2267572 i believe the framers were trying to say that the militia could not be infringed by the federal government and that the individuals right to bear arms also had this protection
2267573 for the most part the movie industry has placed its bets for 40 years on the people most likely to go to the show teenagers and young adults

2267578 prime minister maliki is the leader of a country and im confident he will act as the president and the foreign minister both told me in the last several days
2267579 it will be directly related to the situation on the ground just as they have always said and since we are succeeding i am convinced as i have said before we will withdraw with honor not according to a set timetable
2267580 this is a super quick way to get some checks coming in now
2267581 in december i got 11 host4profit signups 12 empowerism signups and 15 sfi signups
2267582 in december i got 11 host4profit signups 12 empowerism signups and 15 sfi signups this gave me an instant 400 ill also get 194 residual monthly income added on to my total so thats an extra 194 every month as long as people remain a member this doesnt include extra income i receive from sfi for upgrades and success university its been quite a good month especially considering that i did almost no promotion in the past 30 days
2267583 have you heard a song one that moved you one that made you sing along your dreams and hopes will all come true if you believe that every vision begins with you shine for singapore this is your song deep inside your heart where it belongs itll always stay strive for your goals you will achieve with visions so bold
2267584 look at my bicep i have a bug bite on it
2267585 looks fine to me just a bite on the bicep
2267586 but look at the other bicep it looks kinda weird too do you think something is wrong with my muscle
2267587 your muscles are fine they are just old please go away and leave me alone
2267588 this is the first finished genome sequence of an extinct human relative
2267589 but for the first time weve built a sequence from ancient dna that is essentially without error
2267590 contamination has been a constant dark cloud hanging over the field of ancient dna sequencing it has tainted our work
2267591 people have been too busy evaluating the accuracy of the neanderthal sequences to really think about what these sequences actually mean if they are real
2267592 the near complete absence of human contamination is enormously encouraging and bodes well for the neanderthal nuclear genome sequences that have been generated from this sample
2267593 we are on course to publish a complete one fold coverage by later this year
2267594 whatever it was that sparked the emergence of human behaviour 30 000 40 000 years ago im convinced it was not genetic
2267595 major solution over the past 10 years has been to allow these patients to sit in the hallways in the er
2267596 both prophylactic and therapeutic regimens proved successful apparently the sirnas kept hiv from entering most t cells and kept it from replicating when it managed to slip inside
2267597 overall i see this work as an exciting proof of principle
2267598 this is a strategy that can be developed for clinical applications in humans
2267599 this approach is likely to help in bringing down the viral load in patients that dont respond to standard haart highly active antiretroviral therapy
2267600 the advantage of this method is that only a single application of genetically modified cells is adequate to continually generate hiv resistant cells in the body
2267601 its the best thing to happen to long island since de la soul
2267602 any time is a happy time for a birthday party
2267603 well im finally at the damn gate it took me twenty five minutes to get through security you know what those damn security guys took away from my ass

2267612 can you believe the poop came out of hannahs diaper that is so gross
2267613 thats an interesting question but im not sure lets go look it up
2267614 thats an important question but with all this traffic i cant explain right now lets talk later after dinner
2267615 i think its something you eat that makes you act funny
2267616 they deserve credit for just saying this could happen this is the direction things could go if we continue in this way
2267617 in part the advertising is so effective that you find the more people watch tv then those individuals diets are more likely to reflect what they see advertised
2267618 i understand that companies have to advertise to make money but i think they should appeal more to adults the commercials basically are brainwashing the kids
2267619 its not doing research that actually helps kids get better
2267620 you dont instantly become fat the moment you watch commercials
2267621 you watch commercials over days months years and they incrementally change your attitude toward food and your idea about what feeling good means and over a period of years you develop attitudes and behaviors that put you at risk for becoming obese
2267622 im not that psyched that some of these things became prophetic
2267623 if childhood obesity continues to rise then advertising bans of certain foods are likely to become widespread
2267624 opportunities and threats in the context of escalating childhood obesity

2267650 my husband teases me because in the 5 years since my mothers death i have grown nostalgic for many of the things that used to drive me crazy to the point of fury
2267651 i found a love letter tonight from my deceased husband and laughed because he said he just couldnt wait until saturday night it would be in the paper who would be at the totem pole it was glen millers band we were going to brockton high school and started dating at 15 amp 17 after knowing each other all our lives and were married for 42 awesome years before he passed away from cancer what wonderful memories of that place we went as often as his pitiful little grocery store job paycheck would allow thank you for the memories you made my day as i was sitting here missing him so much tonight

2267655 deceived congress with fabricated threats of iraq weapons of mass destruction wmd to fraudulently obtain support for an authorization for the use of force against iraq and used that fraudulently obtained authorization and then acting in his capacity under article ii section ii of the constitution as commander in chief to commit us troops to combat in iraq
2267656 then certainly lying to the american people about invading iraq
2267657 they meant well and sadly turned out to be wrong which is different from intentionally lying
2267658 if attorneys general are protecting me against terrorists who is protecting me against them

2267665 if i as president know where osama bin laden is i would go get him
2267666 at some point probably when the missiles have launched the pakistani government has to know they are on the way
2267667 that profits of crime and war which are destructive of human life of labor of happy healthy neighborhoods whether in the us or in afghanistan africa and iraq are in effect a keystone of the global economy and a determinant of the success in a ruthless competition is a compass needle for human civilization one cannot expect to follow the recipe for roadkill stew and produce a cr me brulee

2267712 in every competition we have to respect every team in the same way and play every match with the utmost concentration
2267713 the team has been talking and analysing the coachs plans in each session weve also analysed the way our opponents play to find the most effective strategy

2267728 our iraqi security forces in general police in particular in many parts of iraq i have to admit have been penetrated by some of the insurgents some of the terrorists as well
2267729 i cant deny this we are putting in place a very scrupulous very meticulous vetting procedure in the process of recruiting a new batch of police and iraqi army which will if you like clean our security forces as well as stop any penetration in future from the insurgents and terrorists
2267730 gave its tacit approval to a series of bomb attacks in italy in the 1960s and 1970s
2267731 following the directives of its government wanted to create an italian nationalism capable of halting what it saw as a slide to the left and for this purpose it may have made use of rightwing terrorism
2267732 i believe this is what happened in other countries as well
2267733 those massacres those bombs those military actions had been organised or promoted or supported by men inside italian state institutions and as has been discovered by men linked to the structures of united states intelligence
2267734 you must abandon your policy of bringing all the political forces in your country into direct collaboration
2267735 claimed that he played a critical role in the fate of aldo moro
2267736 jolted into action by the fear that moro would reveal state secrets in an attempt to free himself
2267737 prepare the italian public for the worst and to let the red brigades know that the state would not negotiate for moro and considered him already dead
2267738 the decision was made in the fourth week of the kidnapping when moros letters became desperate and he was about to reveal state secrets
2267739 it was an extremely difficult decision but the one who made it in the end was interior minister francesco cossiga and apparently also prime minister giulio andreotti
2267740 containing damaging criticisms of prime minister giulio andreotti by murdered christian democratic leader aldo moro
2267741 francesco pazienza a former financier linked to several criminal cases in italy and licio gelli the former grandmaster of the so called p 2 masonic lodge
2267742 well thats not such a healthy choice tee hee but how bad can it be
2267743 terrorist hunt suspects id d rescue efforts go on white house originally targeted
2267744 no signs of survivors recovery efforts intensify fbi launches grid search
2267745 the idea that mohamed attas passport had escaped from that inferno unsinged tests the credulity of the staunchest supporter of the fbis crackdown on terrorism
2267746 most people pay cash for pizza these hijackers paid with a credit card that was an odd thing
2267747 in the end they left a curiously obvious trail from martial arts manuals maps a koran internet and credit card fingerprints maybe they were sloppy maybe they did not care maybe it was a gesture of contempt of a culture they considered weak and corrupt
2267748 whatever trail was left was left deliberately for the fbi to chase
2267749 never perform s one of the most basic tasks of a police manhunt he never runs almihdhar or alhazmi through the ncic computer
2267750 i m no hijacker i m an stc electrical engineer fbi s hijacker is alive and well in saudi arabia
2267751 they gave my name and my date of birth but i am not a suicide bomber i am here i am alive
2267752 this is a respectable family i know his sons and theyre both alive
2267753 very normal fathers say 9 11 suspects showed no warning signs
2267754 saudi pilot alshehri i saw my picture on the television and american investigators contacted me
2267755 there are suggestions that another suspect khalid almihdhar may also be alive
2267756 we have several others that are still in question the investigation is ongoing and i am not certain as to several of the others
2267757 five of the hijackers were using stolen identities and investigators are studying the possibility that the entire suicide squad consisted of impostors
2267758 the men who brought the world to brink of war
2267759 as i have indicated before one of the initial responsibilities of that investigation was to determine who the hijackers were we at this point definitely know the 19 hijackers who were responsible for that catastrophe
2267760 the names were those listed on the planes passenger manifests and investigators were certain that those were the names the hijackers used when they entered the united states
2267761 issues recede in 08 contest as voters focus on character
2267762 looks like everybody in this whole round world is down on me
2267763 stupid man bringing pregnant wife and 1 year old daughter to summit mount monadnock is struck by lightning

2267766 the original leg and arm warmer for children and adults
2267767 death or such other punishment as a court martial may direct
2267768 intrusion by government into the content of programming occasioned by the enforcement of the fairness doctrine restricts the journalistic freedom of broadcasters and actually inhibits the presentation of controversial issues of public importance to the detriment of the public and the degradation of the editorial prerogative of broadcast journalists
2267769 so far not one single house democrat has signed our petition for an up or down vote on broadcast freedom and now we know why
2267770 unfortunately mcdonalds has chosen to side with militant homosexual activists over people with traditional values
2267771 the company has further escalated the controversy by lodging a personal attack against the tens of millions of americans who support traditional sexual morality and legitimate marriage while referring to christians and other people with traditional values mcdonalds spokesman bill whitman arrogantly told the washington post that hatred has no place in our culture thereby suggesting that people who support the historical definition of marriage are simply motivated by hate this insult is highly offensive and anyone who supports traditional marriage should boycott mcdonalds and tell the company why theyre doing so
2267772 the government of the peoples republic of china to immediately end abuses of the human rights of its citizens to cease repression of tibetan and uighur citizens and to end its support for the governments of sudan and burma to ensure that the beijing 2008 olympic games take place in an atmosphere that honors the olympic traditions of freedom and openness
2267773 cases of forced abortions surface in china reported that women in china have been forced to have abortions as late as nine months into their pregnancies the full article can be found at
2267774 for years we have sought to protect women and children in china because it was morally wrong to support chinas forced abortion program now the democrat majority in the house has voted to change existing law and send millions of dollars to unfpa and turn a blind eye to the egregious human rights violations that unfpa promotes in china this is a despicable policy change
2267775 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california

2267784 its true i have never seen you and we have never met never shaken hands or even truly hugged and yet i know for sure you care for me by the kindness that you give and our keyboards keep us together doesnt matter where we live so i give you this gift to put a smile on your face and to let you know in my heart you have a special place
2267785 regardless of any executive proclamation i do not want the flags at the north carolina standards laboratory flown at half staff to honor jesse helms any time this week
2267786 dont blame us we were only being avaricious slothful shortsighted and forgetful
2267787 when gas prices spiked in 1980 the u s was making very big gas guzzling vehicles so they were very vulnerable to competition from the japanese and european manufacturers who were used to selling fuel efficient cars in a market where gas prices were much higher so you would think the u s automakers having lived though that experience once might be guarded about letting that happen again
2267788 the long term challenge is to develop truly competitive hybrid or hydrogen cars we need to make the investments now so that they become available in 15 or 20 years
2267789 in the short run we need to incrementally improve fuel efficiency and help people switch to more efficient cars
2267790 i expect eventually to see hybrids offered across every manufacturers full range of models one good thing is that they are expecting a more permanent shift in consumer demand so they are actually closing down truck and suv capacity and working hard on these new technologies
2267791 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession
2267792 we may have a recession we havent had one yet
2267793 you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline
2267794 weve never been more dominant weve never had more natural advantages than we have today
2267795 neither of the two main opinions in heller link would pass muster as serious historical writing
2267796 what is sometimes called law office history in which each side engages in shamelessly and shamefully selective readings of the historical record in order to support what one suspects are predetermined positions
2267797 if i want to recycle or not that is up to me and no one is going to tell me otherwise
2267798 the extinction and suffering of countless human beings the united states
2267799 attempted to overthrow fifty governments many of them democracies and to crush thirty popular movements fighting tyrannical regimes in the process twenty five countries were bombed causing the loss of several million lives and the despair of millions more
2267800 who controls the past controls the future who controls the present controls the past
2267801 it never happened it didnt matter it was of no interest
2267802 im not talking about blind optimism here the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just dont talk about it or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it im talking about something more substantial its the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the mekong delta the hope of a mill workers son who dares to defy the odds the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that america has a place for him too in the end that is gods greatest gift to us the bedrock of this nation a belief in things not seen a belief that there are better days ahead
2267803 post world war two leadership of president truman dean acheson george marshall and george kennan
2267804 craft ing a new order that married woodrow wilsonian idealism to hardheaded realism an acceptance of american power with a humility regarding americas ability to control events around the world
2267805 signaled a willingness to show restraint in the exercise of its power
2267806 to spread in obamas words its totalitarian brand of communism
2267807 wilsons troops murdered destroyed reinstituted virtual slavery and demolished the constitutional system in haiti
2267808 the african race are devoid of any capacity for political organization
2267809 an inherent tendency to revert to savagery and to cast aside the shackles of civilization which are irksome to their physical nature
2267810 while supervising the takeover of haiti and the dominican republic wilson built his reputation as a lofty idealist defending self determination and the rights of small nations with impressive oratory but there is no contradiction because wilsonian doctrine was restricted to people of the right sort those at a low stage of civilization need not apply
2267811 the united states considers its own interests the integrity of other american nations is an incident not an end
2267812 it was in americas interest to encourage the self determination of all peoples and provide the world a legal framework that could help avoid future conflicts
2267813 buil ding the most formidable military the world had ever known
2267814 american leaders such as franklin roosevelt harry truman and john f kennedy managed both to protect the american people and to expand opportunity for the next generation what is more they ensured that america by deed and example led and lifted the world that we stood for and fought for the freedoms sought by billions of people beyond our borders
2267815 must succeed or the masses this time reinforced by the disillusioned middle class will again turn to the left
2267816 we have about 50 percent of the worlds wealth but only 6 3 percent of its population in this situation we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity to do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day dreaming and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives we should cease to talk about vague and unreal objectives such as human rights the raising of living standards and democratization the day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts the less we are hampered by idealistic slogans the better
2267817 the final answer might be an unpleasant one but we should not hesitate before police repression by the local government this is not shameful since the communists are traitors it is better to have a strong regime in power than a liberal government if it is indulgent and relaxed and penetrated by communists
2267818 occasional encouragement of tyranny when it served our interests obama audacity of hope p 279
2267819 the disastrous consequences of that conflict for our credibility and prestige abroad for our armed forces which would take a generation to recover and most of all for those who fought have been amply documented but perhaps the biggest casualty of that war was the bond of trust between the american people and their government and between americans themselves as a consequence of a more aggressive press corps and the images of body bags flooding into the living rooms americans began to realize that the best and the brightest in washington didnt always know what they were doing and didnt always tell the truth increasingly many on the left voiced opposition not only to the vietnam war but also to the broader aims of american foreign policy in their view president johnson general westmoreland the cia the military industrial complex and international institutions like the world bank were all manifestations of american arrogance jingoism racism capitalism and imperialism those on the right responded in kind laying responsibility for the loss of vietnam but also for the decline of americas standing in the world squarely on the blame america first crowd the protestors the hippies jane fonda the ivy league intellectuals and liberal media
2267820 bond of trust between the american people and their government
2267821 at moments of great peril in the past century our leaders ensured that america by deed and by example led and lifted the world that we stood and fought for the freedom sought by billions of people beyond their borders
2267822 is the nub of the propaganda the brainwashing if you like that seeps into the lives of every american and many of us who are not americans
2267823 and even if we did have only christians in our midst if we expelled every non christian from the united states of america whose christianity would we teach in the schools would we go with james dobsons or al sharptons which passages of scripture should guide our public policy should we go with leviticus which suggests slavery is ok and that eating shellfish is an abomination how about deuteronomy which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith or should we just stick to the sermon on the mount a passage so radical that is doubtful our own defense department would survive its application so before we get carried away lets read our bibles
2267824 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
2267825 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
2267826 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of god
2267827 for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you
2267828 you have heard that it was said to those of old you shall not murder and whoever murders will be in danger of judgment but i say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment
2267829 but whoever slaps you on your right check turn the other to him also
2267830 give to him who asks you and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away
2267831 love your enemies bless those who curse you do good to those who hate you
2267832 take heed you do not do your charitable deeds before men to be seen by them
2267833 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
2267834 whatever you want men to do do also to them
2267835 our own defense department as if the u s pentagon was and is some sort of generally understood paragon of global peace and justice
2267836 the american moment is not over but it must be seized anew
2267837 we must lead the world by deed and by example
2267838 we must retain the capacity to swiftly defeat any conventional threat to our country and our vital interests
2267839 but we must also become better prepared to put boots on the ground in order to take on foes that fight asymmetrical and highly adaptive campaigns on a global scale
2267840 i will not hesitate to use force unilaterally if necessary to protect the american people or our vital interests wherever we are attacked or imminently threatened
2267841 we must also consider using military force in circumstances beyond self defense
2267842 in order to provide for the common security that underpins global stability to support friends participate in stability and reconstruction operations or confront mass atrocities
2267843 its time to stop spending billions of dollars a week trying to put iraq back together and start spending the money putting america back together
2267844 whether civilian dead between the invasion of 2003 and mid 2006 before the worst year of civil war level violence even hit was in the range of 600 000 as a study in the british medical journal the lancet reported or 150 000 as a recent world health organization study suggests whether two million or 2 5 million iraqis have fled the country whether 1 1 million or more than two million have been displaced internally whether electricity blackouts and water shortages have marginally increased or decreased whether the countrys health care system is beyond resuscitation or could still be revived whether iraqi oil production has nearly crept back to the low point of the saddam hussein era or not whether fields of opium poppies are for the first time spreading across the countrys agricultural lands or still relatively localized iraq is a continuing disaster zone on a catastrophic scale hard to match in recent memory
2267845 the corpse on the gurney the success mantra in iraq
2267846 iraq has been killed never to rise again the american occupation has been more disastrous than that of the mongols who sacked baghdad in the thirteenth century only fools talk of solutions now there is no solution the only hope is that perhaps the damage can be contained
2267847 cherry pick the bible to create a jesus and god who are always loving and compassionate such christians
2267848 often fail to acknowledge that there are hateful passages in the bible that give sacred authority to the rage self aggrandizement and intolerance of the christian right
2267849 a story of gods ruthless terrifying and violent power unleashed on nonbelievers
2267850 denounce the biblical passages that champion apocalyptic violence and hateful political creeds as long as scripture blessed and accepted by the church teaches that at the end of the time there will be a day of wrath and christians will control the shattered remnants of a world cleansed through violence and war as long as it teaches that all non believers will be tormented destroyed and banished to hell it will be hard to thwart the message of radical apocalyptic preachers or assuage the fears of the islamic world that christians are calling for its annihilation
2267851 to assuage the fears of the islamic world that christians are calling for its annihilation
2267852 a problem from hell america and the problem of genocide

2267854 smes cant afford to do much submetering but they can afford a power consumption monitor that they can plug selected equipment in to see how much electricity is being consumed by a range of representative equipment
2267855 virtualization offers significant economic benefits to the enterprise and were pleased to add this powerful new capability that our data center customers demand
2267856 this emerging mix of virtual and physical servers is adding a new layer of complexity to it management and its becoming a huge management issue for our customers avocents enhanced software lessens that complexity because it provides a single platform for combined access and control of both physical and virtual servers thereby eliminating the need for a separate set of tools for managing the virtual world
2267857 the findings provide compelling evidence that green initiatives will play a significant long term role in data center planning and design
2267858 our goal for this survey was to determine whether the greening of the data center is a passing fad or represents the emergence of a deeper trend in technology that will permeate the industry for years to come
2267859 these new additions to our range of switching solutions have more advanced features and better pricing than any similar solution on the market today
2267860 building on the enterprise cyclades acs console server family we have now brought this best in class technology to our customers who manage smaller environments so that they too can more easily manage their complex multi platform it equipment
2267861 thats a great way to make sure the cold air in the cold aisle doesnt start mixing with the hot air in the hot aisle any sooner than it needs to
2267862 manufacturers just cant stick up their hand and say this is an energy efficient product he said
2267863 this is how we do it here whos going to take anything
2267864 the principle behind all this is simple and straightforward our private lives belong to us not to either the telephone company or the con artists
2267865 it is also possible because telephone companies may not be doing enough to protect consumer privacy and i will make it clear that companies owe their customers a duty to privacy and need to devise new ways to foil pretexters
2267866 fraudsters are inventive and always try to stay one step ahead as soon as the carriers implement mandated security measures these fraudsters will immediately try to figure out a way around them
2267867 while hardware health monitoring is an important attribute of service processors it is the power management capability that has grabbed the attention of our customers today
2267868 embedded service processors send alerts that signal hotspots in a data center and enable remote power cycling to easily and quickly power down servers when theyre overheating or if a server is not in use it can be powered off to reduce utility costs adding a service processor strategy to the overall data center management strategy also cuts costs because you are leveraging a technology already paid for when the server was purchased
2267869 with the current estimates that 10 to 30 percent of it budgets go toward paying for power we recognize the need to provide innovative efficient power solutions
2267870 based on our vendor agnostic approach of assessing recommending and offering the solutions that best fit our customers needs eatons market leading power technologies were a critical addition to our portfolio
2267871 our ability to offer these niche products in conjunction with broader reaching power solutions is an important market advantage for directnet
2267872 in the coming quarters we expect to continue adding products that meet the unique needs of our customers

2267878 off atwater beach wis this place should be an underwater desert but as the three researchers wearing scuba tanks and lead weights drop through the water the landscape of rounded stones 30 feet below is disturbingly full of strange new life in just a few years the gravel and white boulders that for centuries covered the bottom of lake michigan between chicago and the door county wis peninsula have disappeared under a carpet of mussels and primitive plant life the change is not merely cosmetic in the last three years or so scientists say invasive species have upended the ecology of the lakes shifting distribution of species and starving familiar fish of their usual food supply

2267880 at paypal we are in the process of reimplementing controls which will first warn our customers when logging in to paypal of those browsers that we consider unsafe later we plan on blocking customers from accessing the site from the most unsafe usually the oldest browsers he declared barrett only mentioned old out of support versions of microsofts internet explorer among this group of unsafe browsers but its clear his warning extends to apples safari browser which offers no anti phishing protection and does not support the use of ev ssl certificates
2267881 apple unfortunately is lagging behind what they need to do to protect their customers
2267882 love to say that safari was a safer browser but at this point it isnt

2267892 this is the largest oil accumulation in the lower 48 it is also the largest continuous type of oil accumulation that we have ever assessed
2267893 of the current usgs estimates this is the largest oil accumulation in the lower 48
2267894 it is also the largest continuous type of oil accumulation that we have ever assessed
2267895 we know theres a lot more oil in the bakken shale so does the usgs
2267896 under todays technology that cannot be recovered with tomorrows technology it likely could
2267897 it makes some sense and would provide some comfort i think to those who would like to make longer term investments especially in an oil refinery i hope our state would be interested and the private sector would be interested so we could have a new refinery or a very significant expansion of the refinery that exists

2267900 we are asking them to live up to that proud legacy and treat their workers the same way they wanted farmworkers and immigrants treated
2267901 when it comes to their own workers they just believe they know whats best for them
2267902 its classic paternalism they think of themselves as good people on the side of righteousness and for their workers to question that is hard

2267913 research at yale indicates that people who have more men in their in groups have lower self esteem probably because men provide less ego boosting support than women having a male supervisor also leads to lower self esteem than having a female boss

2267916 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2267917 we respect bretts decision that he could no longer remain here as a packer
2267918 we appreciate the tremendous passion shown by our fans we like them always will see brett favre as a green bay packer and our respect for him never will change moving forward we are dedicated to delivering a successful 2008 season for all packers fans

2267940 that doesnt mean that the kids doing better are doing so because they entered later that might be misleading to policy makers
2267941 if you have a summer birthday private schools will frequently say youre too young you need to wait a year
2267942 when you give kids a little bit more time to develop they find the tasks associated with school developmentally more appropriate and so they are more successful with them than they would otherwise be
2267943 people in the world who feel good about themselves are more effective adults and more effective adults have higher income
2267944 sometimes developmentally it makes sense for them to wait a year particularly for boys
2267945 youre never doing a bad thing by waiting a year
2267946 the perception is its a childless white couple that adopt from overseas but thats not what i found
2267947 more women get custody of children in divorce cases so after a divorce the mom is living with her kids and she meets a man and they get married and he adopts her children
2267948 this is the very first national data weve had on mens lifetime adoption experiences
2267949 from a public health standpoint thats not going to help the consumer or the doctor to treat their illness
2267950 acting with an abundance of caution we are recalling the product from distribution channels until we can determine whether illnesses in virginia are connected to our operations or have some other original source or cause we wish to express our sympathy to those taken ill and we are working diligently to correct the situation
2267951 there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death
2267952 watch the disease progress in a dish that is to watch what goes right or wrong
2267953 i think well see in years ahead that this opens the door to a new way to treating degenerative diseases
2267954 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
2267955 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
2267956 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools
2267957 i think the road is long before we reach that point
2267958 one hypothesis is that they mount an immune response that protected them
2267959 if youre gonna be playing promoting repeating and multiplying music into the world slow down and make a commitment know about it provide it in an authoritative way and give people something coherent so that if theres one other person in there who understands whats being said then theres communication happening which in my mind is the underlying goal of all artistic practice
2267960 how do you share music your audience might not understand without peddling exoticism or rudely ignoring the specific verbal content of the lyrics
2267961 the clothes are so cute the stuff is great i am so happy to be able to do the campaign
2267962 she still manages to keep her nails and feet done and is still very pretty
2267963 she really needs to go to rehab based off what i saw with my own eyes
2267964 watching my loved one become violent and an incoherent stranger certainly tested my faith my very close family member has bipolar disorder which is a mood disorder a disease of the brain
2267965 the lower figure on teens having sex means the risk of sexually transmitted diseases is lower
2267966 young teen mothers and their babies are at a greater risk of both immediate and long term difficulties
2267967 i think the hiv aids epidemic and the efforts in the 80s and 90s had a lot to do with that
2267968 other would bes i have to admit when i first heard her i did not like her however as i kept listening to her music i was like damnnn this chis is hot i started trying to sing like her at home of course
2267969 all my life ive been in a bunch of junk where men were jealous of me
2267970 i said damn hes cute and then i left it alone because i thought he and latifah were a couple
2267971 i didnt know for sure what was going on so i went to work we all hung out later that night and we got to know each other better
2267972 i was like give me a gun and ill just blow my brains out because im at the point of like i said my spirit is dead there was a lot of pain so i ran straight into more self destruction i was thinking about the wife i was thinking about the kids and i was thinking i just dont want to be responsible for that
2267973 gods got to be done with me the low moments and all the insecurities of the past
2267974 your kid is around you 24 7 when you have stepchildren they come around and then they go home my child is going to be watching me go up and down on the days that i go down i dont want my child to feel what i felt when i was coming up what it was like for my mother to hurt all the time so i have a probably one of my biggest fears a fear of my child suffering you know with that energy
2267975 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season he has had a great career with our organization and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
2267976 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
2267977 the packers and brett favre are continuing their discussions the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
2267978 if he was given his release theres no guarantee hed go anywhere to play however hed have the freedom to choose if he should decide to play
2267979 the rift between quarterback brett favre and the green bay packers is escalating and hes giving the team until tuesday or wednesday to work out a trade or he will report to their training camp
2267980 source confirmed the internet reports that favre asked the packers on saturday whether he could come in and compete for his starting job against aaron rodgers but was rebuffed
2267981 favre also said hes signed his letter of request for reinstatement but has not yet faxed it to the nfl offices
2267982 the packers issued this one sentence statement shortly before 5 30 p
2267983 we must keep reaching across the table and in the tradition of martin luther king jr and coretta scott king feed each other
2267984 i connected with her spirit so strongly i am in direct contact with her spirit and that has given me so much peace and so much strength
2267985 we need a mental health court judge to deal with cases just like this
2267986 on thursday paris was ordered to attend a 9 a
2267987 this decision sends the message that no individual no matter how wealthy or powerful is above the law
2267988 i have learned a great deal from this ordeal and hope that others have learned from my mistakes
2267989 im very sorry and from now on im going to pay complete attention to everything im sorry and i did not do it on purpose at all
2267990 put in context you take a sample but a sample done in a smart way so you can extrapolate the data
2267991 what this study says is that this is a problem for the country its your kid my kid the neighbor across the street
2267992 these things can be stigmatizing but loose sexual behavior is not the reason for the higher rates
2267993 once the community risk is higher even if your behavior is not higher the chances are greater
2267994 theres an aggregate of a whole bunch of community factors each doing a little bit making it a little more prevalent
2267995 a lot of kids think he she looks healthy im in love he or she doesnt have any symptoms and therefore are not at risk
2267996 we have to tell our kids you have to be careful out there
2267997 and what can i do for madame that will lighten her load
2267998 sufficiently specific to inform the participants or beneficiaries of the actual charge s to their accounts and enable them to distinguish the administrative services from other charges and services that may be assessed against their accounts
2267999 does not believe that it is necessary or particularly useful for participants to have administrative charges broken out and listed on a service by service basis
2268000 opportunity to reiterate its long held position that the relief afforded by section 404 c does not extend to a fiduciarys duty to prudently select and monitor designated investment managers and designated investment alternatives under the plan
2268001 fiduciary breach or an investment loss in connection with the plans selection of a designated investment alternative is not afforded relief under section 404 c because it is not the result of a participants or beneficiarys exercise of control
2268002 as an interpretive matter that erisa section 404 a 1 a and b impose on fiduciaries of all participant directed individual account plans a duty to furnish participants and beneficiaries information necessary to carry out their account management and investment responsibilities in an informed manner
2268003 small plans will benefit from the proposal because it will clarify what information must be disclosed to plan participants
2268004 likely to benefit from reduced search time and corresponding reduced costs
2268005 are expected to result in the payment of lower fees for many participants
2268006 it is likely to have an effect on the economy of more than 100 million in any one year
2268007 plans may employ service providers for making disclosures and that these service providers are likely to spread fixed and start up costs across many plan clients

2268035 whats this whats going on here whats in here rock on
2268036 clade c vaccine products certainly warrant further investigation in light of several recent publications regarding potentially novel properties of the c envelope and because more than half of the global hiv 1 infections are clade c
2268037 this complicated network of causation has confounded efforts to understand cd says carol nacy ph
2268038 since among other things multiple studies identified the pathogen in tissues of cd patients treating some of these patients with antibiotics that target mycobacteria provided relief from symptoms
2268039 the data collected through this project will assist designers and engineers in developing more sophisticated assistive aids for individuals suffering from various neuromuscular diseases and musculoskeletal injuries
2268040 better orthotic technologies could ultimately help people suffering from this disease greatly enhance the quality of their life
2268041 by understanding how master transcription factors turn micrornas on and off we now see how these two groups of gene regulators work together to control the state of the cell
2268042 micrornas are a special class of molecules because they not only contribute to cellular control but they play important roles in disease states such as cancer
2268043 knowing where genes start is essential to understanding their control
2268044 based on our knowledge of microrna gene start sites we were able to discover how these genes are controlled by the master transcription factors
2268045 we now have a list of what micrornas are important in embryonic stem cells
2268046 this gives us clues of which micrornas you might want to target to direct an embryonic stem cell into another type of cell for example you might be able to harness a microrna to help drive an embryonic stem cell to become a neuron aiding with neurodegenerative disease or spinal cord injury
2268047 we and others are finding that the overall gene circuitry for embryonic stem cells and cancer cells is very similar
2268048 now that we have connected the circuitry to micrornas we can begin to compare micrornas that are regulated in embryonic stem cells to those in
2268049 why did knitting belts survive when knitting sheaths died out

2268053 hut sut rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla brawla sooit
2268054 we have no definite plans to ask for reinstatement right now we have until the sixth week of the regular season and brett has made it pretty clear that he is not willing to come in as a backup if he asks for reinstatement and they start fining him 15 000 a day for not reporting to training camp well that just doesnt make sense were going to let green bay decide what they want to do its their move
2268055 espn com has confirmed that the packers have filed tampering charges with the nfl against the minnesota vikings alleging inappropriate dialogue with offensive coordinator darrell bevell a close friend of favres and a former packers assistant
2268056 the vikings according to a source are expected to contend bevell may have had conversations with favre as a friend but had no involvement in discussing a job with the vikings
2268057 vikings coach brad childress has said in recent days the franchise is content with tarvaris jackson as their starting quarterback what the packers contend is that favre and bevell may have discussed favre coming to the vikings
2268058 i have found for the first time my patriotism challenged at times as a result of my own carelessness more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears about who i am and what i stand for
2268059 i will never question the patriotism of others in this campaign and i will not stand idly by when i hear others question mine
2268060 when favre and winters entered the lambeau field atrium they were met with the loudest and lengthiest of cheers from the packed sold out crowd not a single jeer or boo was heard
2268061 he received even more cheers and then an enthusiastic standing ovation
2268062 favre made a point of embracing the packers storied past thats the thing with green bay its a special place said favre theres a lot of tradition you think of the packers you think of all these great names to be a part of that is a special thing from a public relations standpoint favre was on his game he even wore a sport coat for the occasion so you knew this was no ordinary night
2268063 takes an engaging approach combining gripping history with tools to help contemporary travelers discover historic sites the great outdoors and family attractions along the trail today
2268064 were telling a little known but fascinating and important historical tale including the actual locations where young george washington british general john forbes and their men struggled to make headway and identifying places people can visit and relive these events today great modern day family and outdoor activities are included as well making this book a comprehensive guide to history travel and adventure along the forbes trail
2268065 hey s e meine federn gl nzen mehr mein schnabel ist l nger und verdammt ich hab auch noch die eier mich fast selbst umzubringen
2268066 spitting lies just to find theres a reason why were never satisfied from the long walk home to the reasons why we go to bed alone
2268067 so this is the new year and i dont feel any different the clanking of crystal explosions off in the distance so this is the new year and i have no resolutions for self assigned penance for problems with easy solutions
2268068 ich find alles schei e will eure gesichter nicht mehr sehen und das zeige ich euch verdammt noch mal auch
2268069 oh he is such a nice man he is so caring

2268071 liam is really good the thing about liam is you havent heard the half of it if he could even be bothered to finish some of the songs he started honestly theyre amazing
2268072 but he suffers the curse of the gallaghers its like f ing hell cant finish it ive got demos of his at home with about 40 tunes which if he could be bothered would be amazing
2268073 theyre free to get in but youve got to pay 75 quid to get out
2268074 its a very good time remind western reporters that there are such tools
2268075 it is in the blending of these differences great or small where things become exceptionally visually interesting
2268076 what is art if not a label we must learn to appreciate the work before we govern it with labels it is the viewers biggest challenge the work must be allowed to speak for itself so it can be heard appreciated and understood
2268077 lisas just like that you cant trust her to keep a promise
2268078 ms benilde gonz lez fern ndez has a fascination for abstract design taking color shapes and textures she creates dynamic explosions which continue a thread of communication with their source of origin
2268079 wordpress has always respected the importance of your writing with auto save and now were taking that to another level by allowing you to view who made what changes when to any post or page through a super easy interface much like wikipedia
2268080 gears is an open source browser extension project started by google you can install gears for firefox or internet explorer with support for safari and opera pending
2268081 now when you select a theme it pops up a window that shows the theme live with all your content instead of immediately making it active on your site
2268082 when you digg a story you tell the recommendation engine two things that you recommend the story to other users and less obviously that the users who dugg the story before you are good at finding content the recommendation engine keeps track of users who dugg particular stories before you did and it recommends you the stories they dugg the more content you digg the smarter the recommendation engine becomes
2268083 every time you digg a story the engine matches you with other diggers who dugg the same story and keeps track of all your diggs in common with them
2268084 once the engine has determined your diggers like you your recommendations consist of stories that your diggers like you have already dugg minus the stories you already dugg or buried there are some extra steps like the diversity rules and the promotability constraint described below but this is the basic idea
2268085 since the recommendation engine works only with upcoming stories all the stories you get from the recommendation engine are
2268086 to make sure that your recommendations are diverse the engine imposes limits that keep things from getting too focused it makes sure that no one digger like you determines too many of your stories
2268087 deafside will not be a place for vblogs with a lukewarm reception to asl
2268088 unabashedly support asl and other signing languages and have a strong deaf cultural center
2268089 i ts unfortunate that there is always a small portion of the deaf community that feels the need to protest the most trivial things in life
2268090 id rather seats go to deaf people first once that happens then and maybe being nominated its not my place to be making decisions for deaf people
2268091 whats the hubbub about hes just acting for petes sake
2268092 next to rush limbaughs pain killer addiction as big time
2268093 shutdown halt by root shutting down due to power loss
2268094 it is the next chapter and you said youd explain all about ascona and why were going there but you get sidetracked so easily youre so flighty and anyway i had a dream i was speaking sanskrit and couldnt speak anything else i could see what was going on around me the others were stunned carl jung was there very interested a day passed two days i shed my clothes and nearly naked took up residence on the lakeshore in the manner of an indian ascetic i ate nothing but a handful of rice and didnt sleep sort of like now i was reminded of that naga who ate only rice and scarcely slept yet had a perfect physique
2268095 you know i used to think every little thing i did was crazy but now i think the karma cops are coming after you
2268096 jung was in there i think because it was at an eranos conference those were these things they had in ascona after its original heyday and people like mircea eliade came and jakob wilhelm hauer who did this presentation about kundalini yoga and later became a a bigtime nazi and founded the german christian church which sounds like it was the german christian church but it wasnt it was some kind of blood and soil throw the jew down the well arrangement thats where borat got the idea for the number he does in that texas roadhouse and gets all those dumbfuck rednecks to sing along
2268097 that was later the reason all those posers came in the first place was because of all the people whod already gone there and mixed it up like lenin and trotsky and bakunin and kropotkin and herman hesse and stefan george and rudolf steiner and mary wigman and isadora duncan and hans arp and paul klee and emil jennings and emil ludwig and erich maria remarque and otto gross and like that even annie besant and jiddu krishnamurti came into it somehow and then olga froebe kapteyn and alice bailey had a big set to about who was going to get control of lake maggiore and monte verit which are either right near ascona or synonymous with it and it seems olga won by getting heinrich zimmer to come and talk about hindoo gods and shit
2268098 we should lock up all those damn drug users no excuses they hurt america and make me sick

2268102 this may be the first time a physical signature for a personality disorder has been identified
2268103 for the first time to my knowledge we have a specific brain association for people with a personality disorder
2268104 its new and different because its not a lesion or injury to the brain but it is a difference in perceiving information that comes from an interaction
2268105 its not just a matter of bad attitudes or a lack of will
2268106 we have great strength in the area of personality disorder s through our relationship with the menninger clinic
2268107 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all
2268108 its not in the realm that you would expect it to be if these interventions were really performing
2268109 while national treatment recommendations have focused on aggressive management of ldl c levels mainly through statin therapy we have found little change in hdl c levels and an actual increase in triglyceride levels
2268110 this is not good news as these factors are important components of cardiovascular risk
2268111 a big challenge for biological therapeutics is that they are broken down rapidly in the body the technology developed by asterion ltd is based on basic structural biology work that has provided us with the knowledge necessary to develop longer acting drugs this is a major advantage for patients as it means monthly injections rather than daily injections
2268112 our patented and versatile therapeutic platform technology profuse tm could also tackle major diseases such as some cancers anaemia infertility and diabetes under normal circumstances hormones of the type known as cytokine hormones growth hormone for example circulate in the blood and are bound to proteins that prevent them from being degraded the basic structural biology work we have done in the past means that we can see the interaction between the hormone and the binding protein in exquisite detail our understanding of this structural information means that we can rationally design drugs that consist of this pairing of hormone and binding protein that still allows them to activate the cell surface receptor in this situation the hormone portion of the drug is better protected in the circulation from degradation and so it has a much longer effective life in the body
2268113 when are the midges going to be active and what can we do to put a barrier between our livestock and these midges
2268114 the benefit of these techniques is that until very recently midge surveillance relied upon the use of light traps that sometimes do not represent what is happing on animals particularly well
2268115 all of this work contributes to the aims for better knowledge about culicoides that were set out in the european food safety authoritys scientific opinion on bluetongue published a couple of weeks ago
2268116 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients
2268117 here we found a mutation that affects only the eyes suggesting that this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
2268118 the new information that the nphp4 gene can be involved in eye diseases only can shed light on the etiology of some low frequency eye diseases in people where similar mutations may be involved
2268119 if there were no proper control here blood leaving the mothers blood vessel would trigger release of serotonin platelets would aggregate vessels constrict and the fetus wouldnt get what it needs
2268120 we believe that 80 percent of women experience postpartum blues because of this effect of interleukin 1 beta if our hypothesis holds true lowering interleukin 1 beta levels may be a better treatment option
2268121 we enroll women who are without housing who are living from place to place we often see women who are medically high risk in combination with social and environmental challenges
2268122 we are thinking that one of the things that is missing immediately following delivery is the placenta and that this initiates a cascade of events leading to
2268123 it is clear that our health care system isnt giving americans the health care they need and deserve
2268124 the disorganization and inefficiency are affecting americans in their everyday lives and its obvious that people are looking for reform with the upcoming election there is great opportunity for our leaders to hear what the american people are saying they want from a health care system and to respond with meaningful proposals
2268125 there is no one policy or practice that will make our health care system run like an efficient well oiled machine
2268126 this is going to take strong national leadership and a commitment from all of the players in our health care system but with that and the strategies outlined in this report real progress could be made
2268127 setting out on an academic path at qualification with a cloud of debt overhead is a brave move
2268128 and one that a diminishing proportion of graduates have been prepared to make
2268129 our results show both the left and right sides of the rowers hearts are larger and function at an enhanced capacity compared with those of controls
2268130 the causes of this are not completely clear it could be due to the production of growth factors such as igf 1 during training
2268131 people do have different levels of igf 1 naturally although elite athletes do tend to have higher levels
2268132 when i tell people i attend benedict they comment well youre not black

2268146 some conservatives were unhappy with the perceived liberalism of the rsv but felt that the nasb was too literal they also considered the trend toward gender inclusive language in the nrsv to be a detriment rather than an asset so they sought permission from the national council of churches to revise the 1971 edition of the rsv permission was granted and the resulting translation was named the english standard version
2268147 i survived pinochets dictatorship i had no idea that the same things were happening on the other side of the world

2268150 like all government agencies we are not only faced with specific mandated endpoint configuration requirements but are required to use scap validated tools to verify validate and demonstrate compliance against fdcc requirements
2268151 using scap ready solutions is a priority for nasa allowing us to reduce exposure to operational and financial risk by standardizing endpoint and application configurations based on industry best practices not only does the scap validated security configuration solution reduce the cost of system and application maintenance but it gives us a top down baseline of the security environment for standardizing and automating risk management compliance reporting and security measurement
2268152 by standardizing and automating secure configuration settings government agencies not only benefit from significant security threat reduction but also realize considerable cost savings from a decrease in system and application maintenance fees
2268153 with its scap validation agencies can rely on lumensions vulnerability management solution as a cost effective way to continuously monitor their systems verify that the fdcc standardized settings have not been altered and remediate both software and configuration vulnerabilities if necessary to mitigate the threats associated with mis configured endpoints
2268154 chee soon juan to end death penalty become a democracy
2268155 you are a prime example of a pathetic individual who has left the church if you were ever a part but just cant leave the church alone
2268156 praise to the man i say praise to the fraud
2268157 i am aware that the first vision was told to several different audiences
2268158 brothers and sisters i stand before you today with a humble heart to tell you that i know that a young boy even a 17 year old boy went to a grove of trees and prayed and he was forgiven his sins on that day by one angel and i know that that 17 year old boy went on to look into a hat and read the book of mormon story from a stone and i know that gordon b hinckley is the successor to what that boy created i know joseph smith was a martyr and that he died an martyrs death because he didnt deserve to die after smashing up that printing press and marrying 33 wives including young girls and married women for polygamy is the highest order in heaven i know this church is true because the spirit tells me etc etc
2268159 and these details make me uncomfortable and the spirit tells me to find a different path but my family doesnt understand my concerns and quite frankly they dont even know that a 17 year old boy could see an angel or see christ without god they dont know that peepstones were in hats and plates were never witnessed except with spiritual eyes they suggest i write a letter to boyd packer to voice my concerns and ask for answers my family thinks by believing this story about a 17 year old boy seeing an angel i have lost the spirit but i am here trying to preserve my relationships with them
2268160 i know joseph smith said he saw an angel in the grove when he was 17 i know joseph smith married a 14 year old girl and i believe
2268161 im a very flawed human being im not a spokesperson for any movement
2268162 i just took the line that you dont question your priesthood leaders
2268163 it opened me up to this idea of the world of ideas that i hadnt ever experienced before
2268164 i really hope the membership has the privilege to raise these concerns and not be silenced
2268165 i dont want to attack the church im not an enemy of the church i dont want to hurt the church or destroy anyones faith i want to do things to strengthen the church
2268166 he was motivated through ethical concerns not to ruffle feathers or to create a situation of animosity
2268167 the tone of it was really concerned about the betterment of the human condition

2268169 but when it is really difficult that is where there is room for miracles
2268170 they received the word with all eagerness examining the scriptures daily to see if these things were so
2268171 as long as they do not hold the expedition as an enemy
2268172 say by any chance do you have a mushroom problem in undercity
2268173 theres a great deal of mold but no one seems to care about it why do you ask
2268174 the swamp keeps trying to take over the refuge the druids are having a bit of trouble working with it they say its because theyre dealing with an alien world with a very strange ecology did you notice the workers up on the roof
2268175 they go up there every few days the wood in kaldorei buildings is still alive so it heals itself but only as long as we scrape off the mushrooms first
2268176 theres been much confusion i hate to sound petulant but the expedition cant seem to decide on a role in zangarmarsh tauren and elf alike are driven half mad by the humidity the tauren also thought we should build the refuge out of indigenous materials the elves figured itd be fine to bring in a foreign seed so long as the druids made sure it couldnt reproduce which they did unfortunately the mushrooms seem determined to grow on every wooden surface
2268177 you said the tauren wanted to build using local materials how do you build structures out of fungus
2268178 oh im not really sure you should probably ask one of the druids
2268179 ah zangarmarsh is still a great mystery the spirits here do not give up their secrets easily still we are learning to answer your question the great big mushrooms called zangarstalks have all kinds of uses they start off small but quickly grow while they grow theyre encapsulated in a white ball called the universal veil
2268180 the principles the same just on a bigger scale zangarstalk veils are like leather or hide and can be used for canvas anyway the mushroom eventually breaks the veil as it grows it develops a very hard sheath that encircles the stalk and the underside of the cap this sheath is as strong as wood the alliance expeditionary force made buildings out of it
2268181 the flesh of the fungus is full of air sacs which keep it light sometimes the zangarstalks fill up with water which causes them to collapse in these cases the bottom of the mushroom bursts and the rest topples thats why we periodically drain the zangarstalks around the refuge if they collapse here people could die
2268182 orcish legends say that a terrible and wicked giant lived here until he was slain by one of their heroes the mushrooms sprouted from his rotting corpse
2268183 it is not for me to question the wisdom of the orcish ancestors
2268184 in truth i am a bit troubled i am not sure that all the kaldorei here really understand that we are in an alien world cenarius never walked these swamps im not sure if his powers really apply here
2268185 ive seen druids here shapechange and use other abilities they dont seem to be having any trouble
2268186 our individual powers remain unaffected yet interacting with the local environment is very difficult were this azeroth wed have established a much larger colony of living buildings by now yet the marsh fights us every step of the way
2268187 do you think the problem lies in using azerothian seeds to grow the buildings
2268188 i believe so yes the druids must earn the trust of nature in outland this ecology does not yet know us as protectors
2268189 in my time ive seen our great queen consort with demons survived the sundering waged war with insect monstrosities and watched as nordrassil died forgive me if i sound jaded but an ambulatory corpse doesnt strike me as all that remarkable
2268190 phosphorescence seems to be a common trait in zangarmarsh the sporebats come out at night which is why we named them after bats
2268191 i sometimes forget where i am what is your name
2268192 destron allicant delendius told me that you acted as an unofficial liaison with the lost ones im trying to learn as much about this world as possible do you think you could take me to one of their villages
2268193 hmm umbrafen village is safe enough i suppose the madness is not as deeply rooted there as it is elsewhere in the swamps its a hard journey are you sure you would be up for it many from your world are not
2268194 the pure ones who you call the draenei say i was once like them in truth i do not remember none of us do all i can remember is the marsh
2268195 perhaps as far as i can remember sull has always been my name sometimes i like to think my name was vuunos that is a good name there is a draenei priest named vuunos in telredor who visits cenarion refuge he is very kind to me
2268196 everything behind me is blank i can fill it with whatever i please many lost ones do and some entirely believe it but i know that my name was probably not vuunos
2268197 do your people have any contact with other outland races
2268198 only the ones that vuunos calls the broken they made contact with us though we did not wish it many broken lived here in zangarmarsh the wrekt tribe they called themselves
2268199 the wrekt their warriors came to our village swamp spirits at their beck and call they said that the spirits demanded blood nothing but blood would appease them so of course these wrekt they say that the blood of lost ones will nurture the spirits
2268200 the wrekt gutted us in our villages tore us to pieces
2268201 we could not gather our senses together at times great rages seize the entire tribe but we have no control over it lost ones are poor fighters poor in everything
2268202 i do not know their warriors used to appear every month one month they simply stopped
2268203 did the wrekt have any enemies or allies for that matter
2268204 i do not know much of the world beyond the swamp there was a tribe of broken to the east the dreghood and they were friends with the wrekt yet i only saw a few dreghood here the pure ones did nothing to help us they said they were too busy hiding from the orcs no orc ever hurt me as far as i remember only the broken hurt me
2268205 we made the village in the early days of our curse since then it has decayed it is hard to build things our minds cannot stay on task
2268206 how long has it been since you were last here
2268207 we are the lost isolation is our fate we think only of half formed memories delusions and hatreds the umbrafen stay together for protection not for comfort there are no friends in the tribe
2268208 not really the lost ones cannot hunt or make farms a few of us fish but they only do so to feed themselves plenty of mushrooms though zangarmarsh indulges our madness food is never an issue here if it were wed have all died
2268209 what is that then it looks like it took a great deal of effort to build
2268210 the spirit taps those were not of our making the wrekt built them the shamans sought greater power over the spirits their hope was that the spirit taps would capture the entities of water and air letting the shamans control them
2268211 no it failed vuunos tells me that the pure shamans speak with the spirits and bargain with them the broken want domination to use the spirits as tools
2268212 clearly you hate the wrekt is this sentiment shared by other umbrafen
2268213 all of us hate the broken not just the wrekt all broken vuunos says hatred destroys the spirit but hate is the only spirit i have
2268214 perhaps we are the lost ones lie in filth and care not for the outside world only when the outside comes to us bearing iron and flame are we roused should i not hate i do not know we lost ones ask for nothing yet the broken kill us just the same
2268215 how could we have ever felt otherwise this vuunos does not understand maybe he lies when he says that lost one and pure one are related
2268216 at first i think in a childs first year love may exist between it and the mother but only then after that it fades and both go their own ways survival here is easy a lost one reaches adulthood in three years much faster than the pure ones
2268217 i think so those children will leave vin in another year at most do you see why i spend my time in cenarion refuge i do not know the things they do there but something in their souls is stronger i feel less empty when i am with them
2268218 sull i am very sorry for taking you here you should have told me i dont want you to suffer like this
2268219 some i think the suffering around me is causing that
2268220 hmm just like the pure ones say it is hard for me to imagine that you care perhaps you are only pretending
2268221 we learned from the wrekt the lost ones could always hear the voices of the swamp but we could not understand them our shamans are mad vuunos believes that they actually taint the spirits with their minds
2268222 i think they wanted to use lost one shamans as weapons they had many uses for us i am sorry if that disturbed you the madness of the shamans is spread to us when they are near
2268223 i see them i do not know what could rouse them like this
2268224 no some have already passed us by i think they are headed in the same direction as us though
2268225 the wrekt and the dreghood they are slaves now just as they turned we lost ones into slaves a greater power has made them into slaves
2268226 they killed many of the wrekt and enslaved the survivors truly this is glorious a race of serpent warriors conquered them
2268227 sull you must listen to me the naga are wicked they are the enemies of your friends in cenarion refuge
2268228 we received reports of naga activity just a few days after you left i do not know what they want from zangarmarsh but it cannot be anything good
2268229 i am sorry that sull did not return i have no idea what happened to him
2268230 you are not at fault destron sull made his own choice you say that the naga use the broken as slaves
2268231 thats what sull told me i do not think he knew of the alliance between naga and lost one prior to our arrival
2268232 the broken are in better physical and mental condition than the lost ones i suspect that the wrekt only used the lost ones as slaves for a lack of alternatives
2268233 the people of telredor are glad to welcome you fellow traveler in the most holy light to gain access simply stand on the platform to your right it is enchanted and shall lift you to telredor proper
2268234 thank you lorus my name is talus corestiam im an itinerant mage and scholar im hoping to learn more about draenic history here
2268235 telredor is a good place for learning we stored our records here while we recovered from the orcish attacks many of those records went to shattrath but some remain please follow me our guests typically stay in the temple though i will happily set you up elsewhere if you would prefer
2268236 its a beautiful piece of work when was it built
2268237 quite recently around the time that velen reclaimed the exodar and our anchorites returned to shattrath before then we lacked the resources for such a project gracious renewal shows how through community and faith faith being a prerequisite for a strong community we were able to rebuild from even the worst disaster look close do you see how little the children in the fountain resemble the woman
2268238 the designers did that to indicate that the woman is not the mother of the children however all three are part of the most holy light something that transcends family most likely their biological mother is dead as are her biological children yet they stand together boldly facing the future
2268239 i thank the infinitely holy light every day that i live here there is much camaraderie here in telredor the result of having survived so much suffering
2268240 in shattrath city yes most of my collective was killed in the orcish attack i was barely able to escape with my life
2268241 all draenei experienced loss during that time there was nothing special about me besides i feel joyous living here telredor is a spiritual sanctuary as well as a physical one here i can wait until i grow stronger and am able to better serve the most holy light
2268242 a noble goal have you ever returned to shattrath city
2268243 no i am reluctant to leave the community here do you know of the ashem
2268244 i am not ashem nor are the other permanent residents here however the horde war shook our faith this is an unforeseen generational problem a few of us who were born and raised on draenor could not adapt to the trials of warfare and persecution older draenei are used to hopping from world to world here we had settled in and felt comfortable
2268245 far from common but my generation does have difficulty those affected are called kodei or confused ones the sages believe that we kodei became too attached to material things like cities and comfort we reacted badly when deprived of them
2268246 i fear that the kodei were still there is good news weak though i am my faith grows stronger every day
2268247 im glad to hear that do you intend to leave eventually
2268248 yes i have already visited telhamat and the cenarion refuge one day when i know i can look upon an orc without feeling hatred in my heart i shall go back to shattrath city
2268249 you must understand that my duty is to bring the broken back into the joy of the infinitely holy light however speaking of the wrekt nation is quite painful for them i cannot allow them to slide back into misery that is why i must be present to help if needed
2268250 we broken left telredor into a world of fear and confusion none of us could find the light we were once draenei but no longer
2268251 you are still a brother in the light dear makon
2268252 among us was a broken who had once been a vindicator koshen was his name he said that we had to make things right to punish those who persecuted us koshen led us to orebor harborage
2268253 orebor harborage is an old draenic fort built by our people during the ogre war
2268254 i swore fealty to koshen to establish ourselves we fought the ogres to the north yet we knew that the true enemy the orcs resided in the south koshen said that we had to strengthen our position before we assailed the horde his words inspired us to conquer the lost ones
2268255 did you know that the lost ones were related to you
2268256 the lost ones who seek help receive it makon you know that
2268257 the lost ones have fallen further as you said but the way of the light is not to kill them we must take care around them lest their misery spread to us but those lost ones receptive to the light should be taught
2268258 i apologize brother talus i think this interview must end if you would go to the foyer and wait ill explain more
2268259 we sent an anchorite over to orebor to convince the wrekt to stop their violence i do not know if she ever reached them
2268260 i suppose you would not have really had the resources to send more than one
2268261 you are correct makons story ends with the naga coming to zangarmarsh to their credit the wrekt refused to join illidan most are now slaves
2268262 it is but nobundos partial redemption has proven that the broken are undeniably a part of the most holy light we can accept small groups of them our goal is to cultivate joy in their hearts and when the time is right return them to their brethren hopefully the light will spread from there
2268263 what about shamanism from my understanding the wrekt already practiced a corrupted form
2268264 a foul and nearly unrecognizable form farseer saamo one of nobundos disciples teaches them shamanism that is compatible with the most holy light
2268265 making the broken leave was a terrible thing but we had no choice happiness was in short supply during that time and we could not afford to lose any of it
2268266 i know a girl called elsa shes into alka seltzer
2268267 as long as real estate values continue to decline banks will continue to frantically reduce their exposure
2268268 this is why it seems irrational in the extreme to anticipate a bottom in financials before the bottom in housing is in
2268269 everything i believe in is telling me that i want more
2268270 now were back in leicester we dont see nearly so much of them i havent seen liam in probably six seven months
2268271 i speak to noel more i saw him for a drink when i was up in london a couple of weeks ago it was a civilised night no major carnage to report
2268272 its going to take a lot of people by surprise
2268273 its their best record in years incredible rock amp roll and raw as f its mega
2268274 it felt good to make it at the time and i had fun
2268275 no i wasnt thinking about so and so when i made the piece actually
2268276 explanations are the traitor of art serious art defies easy interpretation and artists should resist the call to explain themselves
2268277 no serious art is easy to interpret nor is there ever a single valid interpretation of art if art is good there are many things to be said about it and much that will remain unsayable
2268278 the pictures i contemplate painting would constitute a halfway state and an attempt to point out the direction of the future without arriving there completely
2268279 heck what artist wouldnt like to be relieved of the pressure of explaining their artwork
2268280 you have talent when you are older you need to go to paris because that is where all the famous artists go

2268285 what issue in this election is most important to you and why
2268286 shes out because shes not on my side and she upsets people
2268287 you need a cheap cigar you gonna talk like that
2268288 my people were polish jews i grew up in brooklyn
2268289 alright so were going to italy ok but greece is the way we are feeling
2268290 now you can see that point a has become locarno
2268291 its a relative thing you understand point a can be in different places sort of like algebra or quantum mechanics one of those things
2268292 and now i can see ascona too just to the south and west of it
2268293 ill tell you all about it in the next chapter
2268294 im looking forward to that because as of now i have no fucking clue why were going there
2268295 i tried to show you but it said we could not calculate driving directions between alexandria egypt and genoa genoa liguria italy so no dice on google maps i guess
2268296 probably for the same reason that were having to take a boat
2268297 see where it says al iskandariyya down here in egypt
2268298 and anyway al iskandariyya al iskandariyah whats the fucking difference its alexandria to white people
2268299 you know what i mean people who just happen to be black arent necessarily black people you feel me look at condi look at clarence thomas
2268300 i just meant you wouldnt be calling it al anything but perhaps wed better not take this any further lest the wrath of allah the gracious the merciful should befall us
2268301 good catch i think its just possible some of the valued readers are from that region and were in deep enough shit as it is with the joan rivers thing
2268302 were just passing by greece look you can see it out the porthole
2268303 i love baseball bruce springsteen stephen colbert and long walks on the beach

2268306 lets look at scary fascinating sharks together lets watch them circle menacingly and chomp on bloody fish lets hear about the most gruesome shark attacks and worry about the next time we dip a toe in the water
2268307 when i break out of these damn ropes youre gonna be sorry
2268308 it was a good dinner right and it didnt cost you anything
2268309 i had to draw an entire chinese junk on the bar wall so he could be reunited with this mistress who ran off to hong kong last year took me three hours he wanted all the details to be just so
2268310 and you had to wait for him to bring her back through
2268311 and how would that look big black brute like you torturing a helpless little thing like me
2268312 smiles on their faces and a teardrop in their eye
2268313 i have to go see a guy about a boat
2268314 and from there we can take a train to locarno
2268315 the long tail by chris anderson by now you probably already know the books
2268316 experts agree that there is a high probability of another influenza pandemic occurring but it is impossible to forecast its exact timing or the precise nature of its impact
2268317 should be sufficient to treat all those who fall ill in a pandemic of similar proportions to those that occurred in the 20th century
2268318 you might want to ask the question for example what happens if many of our heavy goods vehicle drivers fell victim to that influenza and werent able to perform their jobs
2268319 do we have enough back up to be able for example to deliver food to the supermarkets
2268320 i have great faith in the public and they would prefer to have information because the thing that causes fear is ignorance of things
2268321 footyhead mostly for fun and as an online outlet to do some performing away from my other shows and work as the season progressed the adlib and spontaneous nature of doing weekly youtube clips was lessened and planning went into what was going to be done each week
2268322 why do the professional knitters in the shetlands use knitting belts rather than knitting sheaths
2268323 ill give you six credits if you read it cover to cover
2268324 christian spirituality combines a sense of the awe and majesty of god with a sense of his intimate presence this is hard to describe but easy to experience
2268325 the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the fellowship of the holy spirit be with you all
2268326 systematic theology involves collecting and understanding all the relevant passages in the bible on various topics and then summarizing their teachings clearly so that we know what to believe about each topic
2268327 brings together charismatic renewal and classic evangelical theology better than anything i have read
2268328 was impressed with the erudition of american baptist theologian howard ervin
2268329 only a theology centered on the person and work of christ his incarnation earthly ministry atoning death triumphant resurrection and second coming will adequately nourish the church in this or any age
2268330 i will use the categories in which systematic theology was first presented to me these seem as useful today as 30 years ago a classical progression of thought from creation to final redemption
2268331 some overzealous types have fallen prey to such reductionism or into the error of bibliolatry worship of the bible i have seen charismatic preachers hold up the bible and say this is god no it is the word of god and there is a big difference however the expression biblical revelation is still useful because it points to the unique role the scriptures have in preserving and communicating divine revelation
2268332 through his infinite knowledge and power god can be in complete control of everything and still give us authentic freedom of choice he is also able through his infinite knowledge and his transcendence of time to know the contingencies of the future as contingencies and to foreknow our free choices of course only his grace can enable our decision to receive his offer of forgiveness and salvation but there is still a divine human reciprocity he does not coerce this decision and it is an authentic choice god will not violate our personhood by far the most satisfying treatment of divine omniscience and foreknowledge that i have found has been that of thomas c oden
2268333 in broadest terms evangelicals tend to take one of three approaches to the creation science problem some emphasize miracle only in a literal six day creation some ten thousand years ago others combine miracle and process over a long period of time as in progressive creationism still others put even further stress on process as in theistic evolution the last two of these three approaches are the most closely aligned but all three share a strong conviction concerning god as the creator and humankind as uniquely created in gods image in short all seven theories outlined above can be considered as evangelical even though the appearance of age theory may be somewhat tongue in cheek while we aspire to be intellectually rigorous we should at the same time seek to be personally generous tolerance has never been our long suit when a modern scientist refers to the big bang and the christian recites the words of genesis 1 1 3 they may be saying two different things but they are also surely referring to the same mysterious moment that awesome epoch when god by divine fiat literally spoke the universe into existence
2268334 did adam and eve die spiritual death was immediate physical death came later again a half truth from the evil one had tricked them augustine in the city of god rightly asserted that the death against which god had warned them was threefold spiritual physical and the second death of the final judgment this same comprehensive conundrum of death confronts humankind to this day
2268335 did jesus actually think of himself as god could he be both god and a man at the same time if so what does this tell us about the nature of god himself we naturally wonder about christs own beliefs concerning himself did jesus himself have a christology
2268336 david wells makes a helpful distinction between self consciousness which is a psychological concept and self understanding which is an interpretation of who we are and the meaning of our lives we will never fully fathom jesus self consciousness but there are abundant biblical evidences as to jesus self understanding his stated and implied interpretation of who he was
2268337 the puritan pursuit of piety is a paradigm of the christian life puritan is a helpful term because these stalwart believers often maligned and misrepresented by historians provide perhaps the best theology and example of what christian living is all about all of life both public and private is to be related to god christ is seen as lord of culture preventing any kind of retreat into a privatized faith holiness piety is something the christian must actively pursue personal sanctification and social ethics are not seen as antithetical but as complementary how far we american christians have drifted from our roots
2268338 even though i embrace the premill position some of my favorite books on eschatology have been written by amillenialists my one problem with these brothers and sisters is their handling of revelation in general and the two resurrections of chapter 20 in particular
2268339 whatever our millenial view we should remain centered on christ himself and strong in our optimistic and certain hope of his return after all the clear overriding purpose of revelation is to provide us with a transforming glimpse of the grandeur of our conquering savior whose return we all eagerly await
2268340 in our discussions concerning the spiritual gifts we often miss the forest for the trees we debate the nature of the individual gifts dogmatic in our conclusions when in all honesty there is little in the texts themselves to provide the precise definitions we defend we also debate which gifts are still extant assuming our lack has a theological explanation rather than a spiritual one we disagree on the number of the gifts when paul clearly is giving us representative lists not exhaustive ones most important we too often are blind to the attitudes presented as the seedbed of all our gifts and ministries to repeat these character issues foundational to all authentic ministry in the spiritual gifts can be summed up with the slogan unity within diversity love and humility
2268341 i hope this work will prove to be evangelical in the most comprehensive sense of the term encompassing reformed arminian pentecostal charismatic and ecumenical perspectives utilizing insights and illustrative materials from leading popular writers i have attempted to produce a volume that was both contemporary in style and classical in substance a comprehensive theological survey that might actually be read and loving the preaching ministry the way i do i wanted to serve preachers with materials to enhance their pulpit ministeries
2268342 fees work as a scholar who happens to be pentecostal and vice versa has not only opened the door for an entire generation of pentecostal and charismatic scholars who want to take scholarship and their spirituality seriously it has also opened the eyes of those not within a pentecostal tradition to see that a faith that embraces the experiential dimension can also take seriously the role of scholarship
2268343 the commentary on i corinthinians 1987 perhaps afforded him the most visible opportunity to speak as a scholar on issues germane to pneumatology especially in his analysis of i corinthians 12 14 but even here his primary concern was to produce a commentary on i corinthians his approach was first and foremost that of a new testament scholar
2268344 scholars within fees tradition respect his work as a new testament academic and they welcome his voice as having secured pentecostalism an entree to the guild they seem frustrated however that fee does not bear the banner of the pentecostal intellectual tradition into the academys camp
2268345 the baptism of believers in the holy spirit is witnessed by the initial physical sign of speaking with other tongues as the spirit of god gives them utterance
2268346 there is no express teaching on such matters as which charismatic phenomenon is to be in evidence when one receives the spirit
2268347 at the writing task on the average of twelve hours a day six days a week for a period of fourteen months
2268348 to maudine mark cherith craig and brian who taught me that exegesis is not an end in itself but must always be applied
2268349 after this paul left athens and went to corinth there he met a jew named aquila a native of pontus who had recently come from italy with his wife priscilla because claudius had ordered all the jews to leave rome paul went to see them and because he was a tentmaker as they were he stayed and worked with them every sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue trying to persuade jews and greeks
2268350 corinth was one of athenss ancient rivals the capital of achaea it had long since surpassed athens roman corinth was the political and economic center of greece still proverbial for its immorality
2268351 like tiberius an earlier emperor claudius expelled the jewish community from rome possibly around a
2268352 in the ancient economy people of the same trade did not compete with one another as they do today
2268353 by this period the term translated tentmaker was also applied to leatherworking in general
2268354 many foreign nations had settled in corinth including egyptian religions mushrooming in popularity by the second century an inscription from a corinthian synagogue has also been recovered near the agora central marketplace where paul probably worked its location suggests that some members of this synagogue had wealth and social status see vv 7 8
2268355 luke introduces aquila as being from pontus in asia minor but evidently aquila later became a resident of rome
2268356 pauls ministry in athens seems to have discouraged him but it is certain that the immediate christian fellowship of aquila and priscilla gives him tremendous encouragement not only do paul and they share the same faith but also the same trade they are tentmakers the word tentmaker
2268357 as usual paul first preaches in the synagogue but he seems to limit his ministry to every sabbath through the week he works at his trade but each sabbath he preaches to jews and god fearers at the synagogue for several sabbaths he reasons with the jews and from the outset his minstry at corinth proclaims the simple gospel in full reliance on the power of the holy spirit cf 1 cor 2 2 5 the verb persuade epeithen may be translated as a conative imperfect as in the niv trying to persuade but it may be also rendered was persuading that is paul convinces both jews and gentiles who attend the synagogue to believe in the gospel
2268358 most of those years i have wanted to share the things i have collected and the information i have gleaned
2268359 it would be a long way to drive to announce the snowboarder or the beehive and in front of a crowd that would likely be disappointed with that announcement
2268360 when i watch him i see a man with his heart in the right place
2268361 i like george bush because he is god fearing and thats how a lot of people in this area feel
2268362 i like that he is for the family that marriage should only be between a man and woman and the war we need to finish what we started
2268363 im not sure of anything hes done but i like that hes religious thats really important
2268364 when you get down to almost 50 percent in utah thats the canary in the mine shaft of all warnings for republicans
2268365 this is a community committed to faith family and freedom and that translates to consistent popularity for george bush
2268366 people here like so much of what george bush has done
2268367 i think hes got support on almost everything except immigration
2268368 for god so loved the world the biblical doctrine of grace
2268369 im mainly just nervous for matt the individual who came out
2268370 i feel like the honor code office reviewers were very receptive to my message
2268371 i participated to raise awareness or increased understanding for individuals who suffer from problems because individuals isolate or mistreat them
2268372 whatever stand byu takes will more clearly define where the university stands
2268373 many of the students i spoke to are not clear on byus stance regarding the treatment of gay people or of the churchs policy this will probably be a defining moment for them
2268374 i was there when they were mingling amongst our students and overheard conversations and our students explained our honor code very accurately
2268375 music and the spoken word is the longest running program on nationwide network radio ksl tv has aired it for 40 years
2268376 from the crossroads of the west we welcome you to temple square in salt lake city for the 4 000 broadcast of music and the spoken word
2268377 you have brought music and inspiration to generations of americans and i wish you continued success in the future
2268378 it represents the collective efforts of thousands of singers directors organists its really quite a remarkable legacy to be a part of
2268379 ill bump into people and if i have my bag with me and it says mormon tabernacle choir on it and theyll go oh youre with the choir
2268380 sunday mornings i look forward to listening to it and it kind of gives you a calmness and something we dont get everyday
2268381 music and the spoken word draws bigger audiences in its rated tv markets than any other devotional program
2268382 i express my heartfelt appreciation for the way in which all involved with music and the spoke word represent the state so prominently and so proudly throughout the world
2268383 all of you who serve in any way in the mormon tabernacle choir accept of our thanks of our gratitude of our appreciation and of our blessing
2268384 lets not be coy when the lds church says jump thousands of utahns ask how high
2268385 we urge our members to express themselves on this urgent matter to their elected representatives in the senate
2268386 there is a real difference that can be made we are a large and thriving community
2268387 we call upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society
2268388 we believe that religion is instituted of god and that men are amenable to him and to him only for the exercise of it unless their religious opinions prompt them to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others but we do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men nor dictate forms for public or private devotion that the civil magistrate should restrain crime but never control conscience should punish guilt but never suppress the freedom of the soul
2268389 we urge our members to express themselves on this urgent matter to their elected representatives in the senate
2268390 she responded well you need to know that this film its being advertised as a christian film but its really a mormon film
2268391 i asked movie theater employees if it was a catholic film would you say this isnt a christian film its a catholic film
2268392 i was kind of riled up and everyone else was kind of riled up
2268393 but i guess thats kind of the point of the protest i guess the way we were approaching it wasnt the most christian way we decided it would look better to turn the other cheek
2268394 dont ascribe to malice that which stupidity or a plain snafu can better explain
2268395 hey we want a disclaimer in there that the movie really isnt mainstream christian
2268396 yes were christians but were not their brand of christianity
2268397 excuse me do you have your phone number ive seem to have lost mine
2268398 one of the problems with flash is people only think of it as being used to do public web sites
2268399 its a misconception a significant percentage of flash applications people are making now are enterprise applications behind the corporate firewall
2268400 rather than pulling out the back end and starting from scratch they just replaced the ui
2268401 no good development tools to develop flash applications in a decent environment
2268402 a union jack must mean that the band were fascists
2268403 dont ask how but we know his marilyn manson bass player twiggy
2268404 we get marched to a spot behind the mixing desk and theres all these american goths and the gigs going on its all screaming and shouting rape and pillage and all that fucking shit
2268405 he comes into the dressing room and liams been watching celebrity rehab so hes going ah theres fucking kenickie

2268407 living as a writer sometimes meaning you walk into a great howling wind that says you just suck and its all you can do to keep from letting the wind pick you up and put you where it wishes which is usually in the not too distant county of so you admit you do suck its a corruption of an indian name
2268408 we wanted to find covers that in some way summed up an era or broke the mould and these 16 are outstanding
2268409 the tour is bigger than anything the band have done before
2268410 they will be on the road for more than a year possibly pushing 18 months
2268411 the dates could easily run into three figures and will take them around the world
2268412 it is on the kind of scale you would expect from
2268413 part of the exercise that ive been going through over the last 15 months
2268414 we spend quite a bit of time with you on the back of the straight talk express asking you questions and what weve decided to do today was invite everyone else along on the ride

2268417 there were a few things that i could see were going to be impediments
2268418 sometimes i imagine that i hear a howl coming from there
2268419 i have been accused of having an obsession with him i am a minor leaguer compared to his obsession with me
2268420 argh no he may be a mormon but that one looks like a murderer in fact i swear i saw that mug shot on crime watch just last week
2268421 oh for heavens sake hes trying to meet woman why is he wearing a tank top
2268422 barack obama is in no way upset about the cartoon that depicts him as a muslim extremist because you know who gets upset about cartoons muslim extremists of which barack obama is not its just a cartoon
2268423 i think ventura could well win hes coming in with about a quarter of the vote and hes not even declared his candidacy that is much better than where he was in 1998 where he started off in single digits and frankly was a joke candidate
2268424 are you the guy whos here to do the hit job on us
2268425 yes i was here before and the food was good but
2268426 the food is good but it is very long i have told him he needs more help

2268431 oh hey guess what tomatoes are on sale this week
2268432 oh because well those trousers are just a tiny bit tight and so a short belly revealing top would perhaps accentuate any parts you may feel less confident about
2268433 because those pants are tight and if you wear one of those belly flopping numbers that flab is so going to hang out for all to see
2268434 well no point trying to sell coming to england to cathy because this is it only bigger with more shops and refills my obsession with refills is actually quite funny because i never actually take a refill the one huge drink is usually more than enough for me but the very thought that should i so desire it is there for free
2268435 this it we have all this only it costs less and is down the road and yes we have refills
2268436 barack has the courage to talk to skeptical audiences not just friendly ones thats why he told a crowd at a rally in texas that gays and lesbians deserve equality and you can imagine in texas that that crowd got a little quiet
2268437 i have a message for george bush were coming youre going and dont let the door hit you on the way out
2268438 well be looking at a more strategic multi platform treatment of stories that moves audiences from radio to the web readers of the web to television and so on
2268439 were heading into a world where were all going to become content providers not tv stations not newspapers not radio stations
2268440 this is a new chapter in marotta history and part of a turnaround that marotta began in 2002
2268441 over the past six years we have masterminded the technical innovations that have changed our company we listened to our customers and built on our engineering capability through substantial investment in machinery and technically accomplished people this has been a highly anticipated delivery and we are proud to release the first mpact to the boeing company completing this phase moves us one step closer to production

2268447 my child children was were born in a hearing world there they will stay
2268448 protest announcement for the upcoming a g bell association conference
2268449 quite frankly if someone is going to protest over something as frivolous as this they are nothing but a whiny ungrateful brat
2268450 many deaf people are being ignorant about what oral approach those day is really like even they are ignorant about many other things thats even sadder on their part
2268451 god forbid they should actually attend the conference and learn something go to an agbell conference and talk to the kids except i know you wont because you might learn something
2268452 those big bad militants and extremists are attacking poor widdle me again
2268453 shut my eyes and cover my ears and itll all go away
2268454 youre going to get me in trouble you know that
2268455 i knew you were going to call me as soon as i walked out the door i thought to myself shes going to ask me to come back do you want me to come back
2268456 i dont think so it feels different like maybe im just in a different place with who i am now
2268457 its my lawn mower and my yard so i can shoot it if i want
2268458 i think i was princess marie von thurn und taxis in a previous life

2268462 the production and management of negative affect remains a central tool of the national security state
2268463 it was in an email i just got from wiley blackwell about a journal called cultural anthropology
2268464 via flash forward into the akashic records brewster kahle will invent it in 1995
2268465 between the times i stop to give thanks to him
2268466 but yeah its only been a couple days any interesting dreams
2268467 i wouldnt call them dreams exactly but i had this long stream of consciousness thing going on
2268468 yeah it was like i was in this graduate level colloquium on narrative or something there was a lecturer or maybe two of them it was confusing the perspective kept changing you know how dreams are
2268469 right so somebody was saying that in the contemporary action adventure genre everything is always linear and purposeful
2268470 yeah purpose driven which is why novels like that are so popular no matter how complicated things get the hero always knows what to do theres always the next thing
2268471 you can always spot the hero at a thousand paces
2268472 come to think of it how are we paying for this
2268473 this wouldnt be one of those popular purpose driven action adventure novels then would it
2268474 i also ordered sweetbreads and chanterelles chilean sea bass with potato risotto artichoke and braised oxtail and breast of duck with foie gras and dates
2268475 did they cover how talking about money is gauche and clueless

2268485 ah yes from the second duino elegy isnt it those almost deadly birds of the soul guy was a pisser ill give him that no wonder the chicks all dig him
2268486 i was thinking we should drop by ascona its in switzerland down near the italian alps
2268487 but he seems somehow related to that general crowd of aging weimar wandervogel
2268488 i can never be in alexandria without thinking of cavafy
2268489 durrell dropped references to him all the time in the quartet
2268490 i dont so whenever i never come here i wonder what it was he wrote about durrell made it out like if you didnt already know you were intellectually and quite possibly spiritually fucked

2268501 we should be glad that an american is coming who people dont have to demonstrate against

2268504 sugar propellant used by amateur rocketry experimentalists worldwide due to its inherent simplicity and safety is not a high performance propellant therein lies much of the challenge of this project
2268505 besides the extraordinary goal of sending a rocket into space there are other equally important and more fundamental goals
2268506 its all fun and games until you realize youre a monkey
2268507 this data structure is good for this and this one for that
2268508 there is something liberating about just having what you need on your bike
2268509 a tent a roll mat a little bit of food a bit of petrol in your tank and a vague idea of where youre going and thats all you need there is something beautiful about that
2268510 i believe opposing gay marriage and seeking a constitutional amendment against it is immoral
2268511 since you have chosen to contradict and oppose the church in an area of great concern to church leaders and to do so in a public forum we will not rehire you after the current term is over
2268512 i have no desire to be anything but a member of the church
2268513 in accordance with the order of the church we do not consider it our responsibility to correct contradict or dismiss official pronouncements of the church
2268514 since you have chosen to contradict and oppose the church in an area of great concern to church leaders and to do so in a public forum we will not rehire you after the current term is over
2268515 should those professors and or instructors be free to challenge
2268516 isnt it a bit naive to think that conservative professors at liberal schools dont face as much pressure to toe the line as a liberal professor at a conservative school
2268517 academic freedom 1 teachers are entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results subject to the adequate performance of their other academic duties but research for pecuniary return should be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution 2 teachers are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject but they should be careful not to introduce into their teaching controversial matter which has no relation to their subject limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment 3 college and university teachers are citizens members of a learned profession and officers of an educational institution when they speak or write as citizens they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline but their special position in the community imposes special obligations as scholars and educational officers they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances hence they should at all times be accurate should exercise appropriate restraint should show respect for the opinions of others and should make every effort to indicate that they are not speaking for the institution
2268518 when they speak or write as citizens they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline
2268519 i sustain the first presidency and quorum of the twelve apostles as lds general authorities however i reject the premise that they are thereby immune from thoughtful questioning or benevolent criticism
2268520 have you ever worked in the private sector for any length of time
2268521 when they speak or write as citizens they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline
2268522 2 teachers are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject but they should be careful not to introduce into their teaching controversial matter which has no relation to their subject limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment
2268523 perhaps nielsen has forgotten it is the role of the
2268524 if we believe in god the creator then the creation is the greatest revelation homosexuality is a natural phenomenon
2268525 i believe opposing gay marriage and seeking a constitutional amendment against it is immoral
2268526 i think everyone has an inviolate right to an opinion on any matter church related or not
2268527 please provide me any evidence of repeated unanimous statements of the fp and q12 on those examples you cite and i am happy to respond
2268528 never mind the fact that blacks and women are the true civil rights battles and have little or nothing to do with the so called gay
2268529 the point that i clearly made and the only point that i made was that the natural existence of an inclination in humans is irrelevant to the question of what god expects of us if you have a problem with that argument take a crack at it but dont infer arguments and connections that i dont make however convenient and irresistible it might be to do so
2268530 you cant logically compare the church and its edicts to congress and its laws there is simply no comprable analogy when it comes to free speech issues congress is obligated to follow the constitution private churches are not are you suggesting churches whether lds or others are not able to proscribe certain conduct of its members
2268531 equality you make several historical remarks and then drop them into the 21st century without any context do you believe that the perfect can be the enemy of the good frail humans like us often need to take baby steps toward perfection if you expect us to become perfect all at once you really damn us all where is the mercy in that
2268532 interesting question yes i think he has i loved what he said but i dont feel that byu should be obliged to retain him he did just slam the president of the corporation of the president
2268533 you can look at your studies and ill look at mine
2268534 you make the biggest flawed assumption of all that there is a god that has any influence on the sexual orientation of even one single human on earth for this you have no scientific proof none not a bit none whatsoever zero nada zilch
2268535 perhaps there is a god but you dont have scientific proof
2268536 its biological i cant help it would i choose this etc
2268537 the guy from abbey road was like ive got it block booked for the exact time you want it
2268538 ioc officials negotiated with the chinese so that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
2268539 i regret that it now appears bocog beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad has announced that there will be limitations on web site access during games time
2268540 if a few web sites are difficult to browse its mainly because they have spread content that is banned by the chinese laws
2268541 the internet is regulated according to law in china just like in other countries
2268542 the channel is smooth for foreign journalists in beijing to report the games and report china using the internet
2268543 coming just nine days before the opening ceremony this is yet another provocation by the chinese authorities this situation increases our concern that there will be many cases of censorship during the games we condemn the iocs failure to do anything about this and we are more than sceptical about its ability to ensure that the media are able to report freely
2268544 the chinese governments controls on the internet are contrary to the free reporting environment promised by the hosts and contradict international olympic commission assurances that the press will be able to operate as at previous games thousands of visiting journalists will now get to experience the censorship that reporters and other internet users in china have to put up with every day

2268789 central auditory development in children with cochlear implants clinical implications sharma a dorman mf m ller ar ed cochlear and brainstem implants adv otorhinolaryngol basel karger 2006 vol 64 pp 66 88 doi 10 1159 000094646 article pdf 349 kb free preview medline abstract id 16891837 abstract a common finding in developmental neurobiology is that stimulation must be delivered to a sensory system within a narrow window of time a sensitive period during development in order for that sensory system to develop normally experiments with congenitally deaf children have allowed us to establish the existence and time limits of a sensitive period for the development of central auditory pathways in humans using the latency of cortical auditory evoked potentials caeps as a measure we have found that central auditory pathways are maximally plastic for a period of about 3 5 years if the stimulation is delivered within that period caep latencies reach age normal values within 3 6 months after stimulation however if stimulation is withheld for more than 7 years caep latencies decrease significantly over a period of approximately 1 month following the onset of stimulation they then remain constant or change very slowly over months or years the lack of development of the central auditory system in congenitally deaf children implanted after 7 years is correlated with relatively poor development of speech and language skills geers this vol pp 50 65 animal models suggest that the primary auditory cortex may be functionally decoupled from higher order auditory cortex due to restricted development of inter and intracortical connections in late implanted children kral and tillein this vol pp 89 108 another aspect of plasticity that works against late implanted children is the reorganization of higher order cortex by other sensory modalities e g vision the hypothesis of decoupling of primary auditory cortex from higher order auditory cortex in children deprived of sound for a long time may explain the speech perception and oral language learning difficulties of children who receive an implant after the end of the sensitive period

2269051 the ability to include more media in calls provides an excellent opportunity to include people with disabilities in online conversational services but too often discriminatory voice telephony services are simply re created

2269149 for those with experience or even knowledge what are signs that a man is married back in mexico i am dating this guy and he says he is single has no kids and is 35 i just dont know if this is even possible
2269150 my uncle actually two of my uncles are in there forties with no kids and never been married its sooo possible
2269151 believe it hes single he hasnt been looking or just doesnt know where to meet anybody and probably doesnt have the time and if you believe in a higher power maybe it was just time that he met someone that just clicked with him
2269152 it is very possible for a man to be 35 and not married or have kids nothing wrong with it he just has not found or wanted the right woman
2269153 i have some mexican in me and very proud of it btw so i cant make racist comments i think you should really try to get to know this guy first go back to his hometown in mexico and visit his family it is very possible that a 35 year old guy is not married and has no children why not maybe he just chose not to be in a committed relationship before he met you if he has a wife back home just mentioning the idea of visiting his hometown will surely make him nervous watch his reaction and to also ask him questions about his life what hes done so far what his family does and where they live etc
2269154 meh give him time he will get comfortable and show his true colors and it will become obvious why he was never married
2269155 ya some people just havent found who they want to marry yet he could be telling the truth it depends how believeable he is and if he is a good liar
2269156 i have some mexican in me and very proud of it btw so i cant make racist comments i think you should really try to get to know this guy first go back to his hometown in mexico and visit his family it is very possible that a 35 year old guy is not married and has no children why not maybe he just chose not to be in a committed relationship before he met your friend if he has a wife back home just mentioning the idea of visiting his hometown will surely make him nervous watch his reaction and to also ask him questions about his life what hes done so far what his family does and where they live etc
2269157 i swear this is true i heard it with my own ears
2269158 she should address urgently the skyrocketing prices of oil which bring 23 million filipinos going hungry for every p1 increase in prices it will affect not only the poor they have already suffered enough but also the middle class these subsidies that gma is talking about the lifeline subsidy rice subsidy etc are mere palliatives we want gma to suspend the ad valorem tax and the expanded value added tax of 12 percent because these taxes have worsened the suffering of the poor we want gma to be accountable for the p7 3 billion that government lost to corruption 2m president diosdad macapagal avenue free port agri fertilizer swine scam telepono sa barangay among others this amount does not include yet the p329 million zte deal we want the prosecution of personalities involved in questionable government deals like jocjoc bolante nani perez among others millions of filipinos are going hungry while gma and her officials squander the peoples money we want gma to prioritize urgent economic bills such as the 125 peso across the board wage increase bill the repeal of the oil deregulation law and the implementation of price control act of 1992
2269159 gma gloria macapagal arroyo should be serious and decisive in resolving the crisis and not just give band aid solutions she should shift her priorities to agricultural development and should provide support to farmers to ensure affordable prices of rice
2269160 gma should address the peoples poor living conditions she must answer first the rising prices of products including that of fuel the cost of fare now is very high my child couldnt go to school anymore because i could no longer afford to send her to school our money is just enough to buy nfa rice every time we buy nfa rice at the store we tell each other that we will not vote for gloria again if she runs in 2010 no one will believe her anymore we are worried that if she remains the president we will start eating bran tahup instead of rice because of the increasing prices if we get sick we dont have money for medicines living conditions were even better during eraps and marcos time she keeps ignoring the increase of prices shes just making herself rich poverty is not caused by god anymore but by the government its the poor not the businessmen who suffer the most some cant even eat thrice a day some would only drink coffee in the morning while others combine their breakfast and lunch
2269161 i do not know anything about sona i open my store at 7 am and i go home at 11 pm sorry i know nothing about that
2269162 president arroyo should focus on the economy she should address the countrys crises the salaries and wages of the employees and the workers the fuel problem the peace and order situation and the rice problem i hope that we will not import rice from other countries anymore and start exporting rice instead
2269163 the president should address our problem on fuel because it has a domino effect if the price of gasoline increases the prices of basic commodities like rice and other staple goods will automatically increase
2269164 sana lifting value added tax on fuel increase taxes on tobacco products and liquor and subsidize rice for the poorest of the poor all must be done immediately
2269165 since president gloria macapagal arroyo has just approved the amendment on the tax exemptions to low earners the president should ensure that it will be implemented it is good news to our poor workers
2269166 talk on corruption in government what happened to the implementation of agriculture modernization law to increase production and food supply we are now net importer of most commodities no production increase due to comprehensive agrarian reform program jobs and poverty reduction she should step down after her term
2269167 the crises on oil and rice must be addressed increase the salaries and calamity funds more jobs for the filipinos housing projects for the poor fight against corruption
2269168 solutions to the high inflation and food prices police impunity comprehensive agrarian reform program carp energy crises expanded value added tax oil food security vis vis carp and agricultural support vis vis renewable energy a k a ethanol and peace
2269169 first on the list for me should be finding a solution on the oil problem i agree with what the church said that the p500 power subsidy could only make more people dependent they should have used the money for a more concrete long term plan then the rice shortage pa talaga dami na kasi lupa na dapat pwede sanang taniman ng palay which were converted to other use
2269170 a few weeks back in a published article a world bank report cited the philippines as the most corrupt country in east asia this is a grave concern of every filipino
2269171 i hope she will solve the zte issue the political killings the continuing poverty and the high prices of rice
2269172 she should address poverty issues because it has been a lingering problem in the philippines that should be the primary thing the government should tackle there is rise in the prices of fuel and rice we cannot control it everybody experiences it we in the police are lucky because the president check on us we have a cheque although its not so substantial maybe other government agencies should also have some kind of subsidies like what we are having how can you cope with the rising prices of basic commodities if your salary remains the same all of us clamor for an increase in salary so the government should address that but where would the government get the money
2269173 land for the landless landlessness is responsible for widespread poverty if the middle class is already affected by the current food crisis what must the poor be eating arroyo should address the peoples issue of landlessness and address peoples needs for food shelter and education recent surveys showed more children are dropping out of school this year
2269174 the current wages simply arent commensurate to the increasing prices of basic commodities particularly rice and oil
2269175 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material
2269176 people have to realise this is one of the poorest counties in the whole nation
2269177 it means we will become self sufficient as a tribe
2269178 dont go in there uncle do not go in there
2269179 thats a pretty bigoted thing to say dont you think

2269201 these are rough lands undead a soft human merchant wouldnt survive a day out in the barrens caravans are too important to be led by anyone other than a warrior
2269202 so in a sense there is no distinction between guard and merchant on a caravan
2269203 any warrior may try but the elders must give their permission a caravan leader must have wisdom know how to deal with others and can be relied get the caravan to its destination in one piece thats why it almost always goes to older warriors like myself the whelps are too eager to shed blood
2269204 is your caravan a private concern or are you doing this on behalf of orgrimmar
2269205 im not sure what you mean all that i do is on behalf of the horde
2269206 im sorry please pardon my ignorance im afraid i do not quite understand what you mean however
2269207 as an older warrior i thought this would be a good way to serve the horde the caravans need to be managed and trade is important to the orcs we do at times have special shipments that the warchief needs to be sent somewhere but those are simple matters this caravan is my own
2269208 its difficult business to be sure i was never much good with a battle ax though so it is not my place to expect too much
2269209 are all the stores here in orgrimmar owned by peons
2269210 where did you get that idea many are owned by warriors it is a common choice for those that have become too old for the battlefield they are honorable and know that past glories will not sustain orgrimmar or the horde
2269211 so to live here you must contribute to the citys survival in some way
2269212 once we made landfall in durotar i did what i could to build a new home for my people i was better than most peons so i was able to get more money i was also better at saving it as i got older i opened up my shop here so long as a peon has no other obligations he is free to try and make his way
2269213 for instance if a peon is at work on the frontier he must stay there until it is settled
2269214 is there any difficulty in competing with warrior owned shops
2269215 yes though such is simply the way of things i did little with my life the barrels i made will be dust before long the deeds of great warriors will echo throughout the generations and the blood of the fallen nurtures this city people would prefer to buy from warriors and i do not blame them none can dispute their honor
2269216 some are we do not compete with the warriors if that is what you are saying an honorable peon will close down his shop if a warrior builds the same kind of shop in the same neighborhood we never forget those to whom we are obliged
2269217 reading and writing is secondary our greatest duty is to teach honor the ways of the spirits and the glory of the ancestors
2269218 in what sense do you teach them the ways of the spirits
2269219 a young orc must learn respect first and foremost it is for the elders and for the idea of honor also important is to revere the spirits that make this world we are in debt to the spirits of azeroth that they accepted us after the corruption of our race is something that we can never repay
2269220 i would not say so all orcs must provide an example for the young i teach them of honor yes but the teaching begins even before they are old enough to enter my tutelage honor is the essence of orcish life
2269221 are all orcs in agreement as to the definition of honor
2269222 honor is not always simple humans often think it only means courage in the face of death it would be more accurate to say that for an orc to be honorable he or she now must be brave in all aspects the courage to put the needs ahead of your own to argue for what is right even when others turn against you to heed the desires of the spirits these things and many more make honor are you familiar with the difference between pack honor and personal honor
2269223 that is one example in the past before the corruption honor meant bravery in battle and loyalty to the clan the legends say that our world was exceedingly dangerous even before the demons came while warriors boasted of their skill and accomplishment they served their clans mostly without question this was the fatal flaw however once the demons began to spread their influence almost no one objected we cannot again allow ourselves to be led astray thus an orc with true honor is not afraid to be mocked if he knows in his heart that he is right he shall not fear
2269224 some beliefs are not worthy of consideration any orc who wishes to return to demonic servitude is without honor and has no place in orgrimmar you must understand that thrall still makes the ultimate decisions for the new horde he is wise and listens to the various elders who often disagree with each other or with him once thrall makes his selection though all must follow
2269225 pardon me but doesnt that create the same situation that existed before the corruption
2269226 no then we were led by fallible chieftains and lesser shamans thralls honor and wisdom are unquestionable
2269227 i do not know i do not think there will ever again be an orc like thrall whoever his successor is we will not be able to trust him in the same way we trust the current warchief i imagine in those days that the elder circle will be more important than it is today
2269228 the smiths here are all warriors but they would not be able to craft the weapons of war without the peons we protect the peons and they support our ability to do so
2269229 i had always been something of a scribbler the ax is my true passion but i cannot always be swinging it as a child id draw images of the orcish legends in charcoal the same way my ancestors did orcish art was always fierce and striking though flat i do not mean any disrespect to our ancestors with that comment it is simply the truth and there is much to admire in that style
2269230 i saw some human paintings that had been in admiral proudmoores possession during the invasion i did not like them i thought that they were stiff and dull but i admired the way they looked like things you would see in real life it was as if the artists hand was guided by the spirits eventually though i learned that it was accomplished with tools like perspective and shadowing i used these tools in combination with the traditional orcish style i wanted to portray the ferocity and power of the great warriors to make it seem as if they could leap up from the canvas and enter the nearest melee
2269231 i had thought it just a trifle at first but artok stoneblade who was then the pack leader of the bloodgaze saw a picture i had done of grom hellscream in battle he liked it so much that he requested i make one for him this sort of thing kept happening until i received the ultimate honor of a request from thrall thrall wanted an image of orgrim doomhammer at his final stand in arathi
2269232 that is quite an accomplishment do you charge for these images
2269233 why would i do that i am a warrior before i am anything else i certainly would not ask payment the warchief he has given the orcs more than they can ever repay at most my images remind orcs of the greatness of our heroes and ancestors my true honor exists in my courage
2269234 the wyverns are not like those overgrown bats you have in undercity or those foolish griffins so adored by the dwarves the wyverns are a great race proud and savage like orcs and i do mean that they are a race a wyvern is as much a horde warrior as i
2269235 they speak to each other the roars and cries of the wyverns contain words they gather in clans across the wilds of kalimdor thrall freed this wyvern clan from the grip of the harpies and they have promised to aid the horde in return
2269236 i do not know the shamans are the only orcs that can truly speak to wyverns and even then they must speak through the spirits
2269237 the bond of a wind rider pair transcends language it is an intuitive understanding
2269238 in your own words how would you explain the relation between wyverns and orcs
2269239 it is simple the wyverns permit us to use them as mounts when needed the young whelps carry warriors into battle while older wyverns take messengers across this wild land they are even magnanimous enough to permit peons to ride them though i cant imagine they enjoy it much
2269240 yes we call him the stormbringer and he resides in the mountains to the north only the warchief is permitted to take the stormbringer into battle i saw him once undead and it was a sight of indescribable glory
2269241 may i ask what brings you to the darkbriar lodge
2269242 simply curiosity i myself am a mage and i was curious to learn more about my trollish kindred
2269243 this is the place to learn more about it i am dajyah an apprentice to great wizard gujomb gujomb is sleeping he is quite old you see but i will try to answer any questions you have im sure that once he is awake he will be happy to see you
2269244 i do have a few questions how long has the darkbriar lodge been in existence was it founded along with orgrimmar or does its history extend beyond that
2269245 the darkbriar lodge is new when thrall began the construction of orgrimmar gujomb saw a perfect opportunity to create a sanctuary for mages
2269246 ive visited stranglethorn and from what i saw it did not seem that there were many mages among the trolls there what exactly was gujombs status in the old country
2269247 trolls do not trust magic we still remember how elven sorceries gutted our cities and killed our people that said magic is too powerful to ignore or dismiss among the jungle tribes wizards lived on the outskirts of villages only those with great need were permitted to speak with wizards usually on behalf of the entire village in times of peace and plenty all would shun the mage the hunters would give him food some of the choicest cuts in fact but they would never talk to him
2269248 every forty years the headman would pick a newborn from the village as the apprentice this infant would be declared dead and treated as a sacrifice before being given into the mages care
2269249 given that mages were so isolated i find it surprising that they would make very good parents
2269250 so you were given over to gujomb when you were a baby
2269251 no though gujomb would have made a better parent than most wizards i think the situation of the mages has changed quite a lot the wizards of stranglethorn few though they were understood the danger brewing in zulgurub they aided senjin when he slew our old chieftain the one who had been bewitched by the gurubashi only gujomb and uthelnay his apprentice came to the islands with the darkspear yet much later when the orcs saved us from the murlocs and we came to durotar gujomb sensed the great power of this spot he cast spells here to speak with the surviving stranglethorn mages to tell them that there was a haven for their kind they had been in hiding for some time and many were dead gujomb arranged for their arrival in durotar and when they set foot in the valley of spirits the darkbriar lodge was truly born
2269252 im gladdened to hear that are the mages accepted here
2269253 the darkspear recognize what we did for the trollish people so they no longer shun us that is not to say that they like us but we take what we can get to speak truly most other darkspear are not all that fun anyway
2269254 my father died when i was very young and my mother did not again take a husband even though many fine hunters proposed this angered the tribe and she was not treated much better than the wizards were then came the trouble with zalazane do you know who he is
2269255 my mother was a bit odd in the head but she never consorted with any man after my father certainly not zalazane but the tribesfolk wagged their tongues and spoke dark things about her for she was unmarried there was no good reason to stay in senjin so she took me to orgrimmar gujomb met me and thought i had potential to be a mage even though i was already eleven years of age at the time
2269256 youve come quite a long way then i commend your courage for being so open about your past
2269257 my mother rests with her husband now and it would shame her spirit for me to lie about the past ive never met a mage who condemned me for it that is why i am happy to live here in orgrimmar
2269258 i do back at senjin they teased me because i look like a human and because id rather learn new things than listen to the boasts of hunters hunters boast here too but its easier to ignore them when they do most dont like coming to this part of the city anyway
2269259 what is the source of the distrust between the priests and mages
2269260 in all our history the priests have never been able to decide if the loa like magic or not im sure in another millennium theyll have figured it out
2269261 isnt there a loa of the arcane bethekk i believe
2269262 yes but the priests want to be the sole medium between the trolls and the elawi they fear that by using the arcane the mages might supplant them at least in bethekks eyes we pay bethekk appropriate homage and respect there is a shrine to him in the lodge even
2269263 say there destron gujomb was wondering if you could lend us your expertise on a matter of some trouble
2269264 the orcs in the cleft of shadow stumbled upon what they think is evidence of a demonic plot
2269265 the orcs have thrown off the curse but the demons dig in their claws and do not want to let go some orcs go back to the old ways from what i understand they pretty much know what it is but gujomb wanted you to take a look just in case theres going to be a council tomorrow in the cleft of shadow uthelnay will go as well
2269266 ah man i like the orcs sure enough but i certainly do not understand them they speak so much of how they overthrew the demons yet here they go and start playing with them again
2269267 they want to fight fire with fire i think magic has its dangers yes but we mages do not speak with demons i suppose that having warlocks helps them figure out how the shadow council thinks
2269268 is the shadow council still a great threat to orcish society
2269269 i used to think so nowadays i am not so sure
2269270 i have been told that members of the brotherhood are still considered warriors is this true
2269271 ha ha ha we are not considered warriors we are warriors only those who pass the warrior tests may be admitted and even then they must pass many other trials we are like the scouts of old fast with blade and spear ruthless to the enemies of the horde
2269272 honorable warriors of the horde we have found treachery in our ranks in our very own city
2269273 do not try to speak like a warrior neeku for you can never hope to be one were your attempts not so amusing i might strike you down for impertinence
2269274 forgive me i shall allow harz to introduce the evidence it is he who found it
2269275 two days previous i sensed a surge in infernal energy coming from the upper part of the cleft of shadow when i went to investigate i found this
2269276 have you damned peons lost your minds that is the shield of a warrior
2269277 and why would a warriors shield be lying abandoned here in the cleft of shadows
2269278 warriors are taught to care for their equipment and i do not think a true soldier of the horde would be so careless as to leave it there i imagined that perhaps a pack of demons had ambushed and bested a warrior though the fact that there were no signs of a struggled suggested otherwise im sure the warriors here take care of their equipment
2269279 very well the fel magic came from this shield i examined it in my study the emblem of the horde on this shield is not as it appears it is made of countless demonic runes written on top of each other so as to create the illusion of an image it is a message one evident to those with fel tainted souls but less obvious to those with honor
2269280 in short it reads the searing blade triumphantly cuts away at the cowardice of the warchief
2269281 how dare you take back what you have said about our warchief
2269282 dosk calm yourself harz is only reading the message continue warlock
2269283 forgive me these are not my words i will gladly slay whoever wrote them the message speaks of a cult called the searing blade that makes its home in ragefire chasm just beneath where we now stand none of the warlocks here have ever heard of this group clearly they are still weak and careless otherwise they would not have left this message in such an obvious place the shield should be examined by the mages and shamans present so they may confirm my judgement
2269284 you have served the horde admirably young harz while your chosen path is distasteful the orcs do not dismiss those who can provide aid the opinion of the other mystics here is unanimous at least in regards to the objects fel origins
2269285 perhaps the warlocks here arent the only ones lacking in ability
2269286 why has the shadowswift brotherhood not taken notice of this do they shirk from our darkest foes
2269287 for all we know the shield was made by the warlocks to discredit us normal peons at least have the lesser honor of labor the warlocks lack even that we should kill them all i am an honorable warrior as are all shadowswift brothers
2269288 or perhaps he accuses the warlocks because his own honor is somewhat lacking as im sure any of your shadowswift brothers could tell you honor is not static one must always strive for it and it is said that those who lack honor are the quickest to defend their own
2269289 what i shall show you honor tarmok you are a noble warrior but i think these warlocks have deceived you with their treacherous magic come face me harz you wretched peon
2269290 it would take someone stronger than you to control the forces at my beck and call
2269291 dosk you have acted in a foolish and dishonorable manner go back to the shadowswift brotherhood and see to it that you get them in shape do not accuse me of being deceived for my honor and wisdom are both greater than yours
2269292 under normal circumstances i would have you flogged for using your demon to attack a warrior even if he did deserve it in light of your skill and service though i will let you off with a warning never forget that you are not a warrior perhaps it does take strength to control a demon it also takes a terrible spiritual weakness to consort with one
2269293 what foolishness was that harz you could have gotten us both killed you can barely even control that felguard of yours
2269294 we are both peons but only you are a cripple the horde will never recognize your abilities and you are a fool to think that it will
2269295 i serve the warchief and i shall do so with strength and honor
2269296 these rebates will deliver up to 600 per person 1 200 per couple and 300 per child
2269297 this package will help american families help me move even more money from the treasury to my friends in the oil business
2269298 i noticed again today that senator obama repeated his opposition to giving low income americans a tax break a little bit of relief so they can travel a little further and a little longer and maybe have a little bit of money left over to enjoy some other things in their pathetic little lives
2269299 obviously senator obama does not understand that this would be a nice thing for these low budget unwashed americans and the special interests should not be dictating this policy
2269300 senator obama wants to raise the capital gains tax which would have a direct effect on 100 million americans
2269301 that means he has no understanding of the economy and that he is totally insensitive to the hopes and dreams and ambitions of 100 million americans whose lives will be destroyed and whose children will be gang raped by his almost doubling of the capital gains tax
2269302 we have to look for ways so we can eat
2269303 we even make suman rice pudding from our pigs feeds milled rice hull for our merienda
2269304 if they dont support us i dont know what will happen to my family my salary is not enough for our needs
2269305 although it is still not enough it would be a big relief for me and my family and the families of workers nationwide
2269306 any increase given to the workers through the rtwpb does not give justice to the workers demands
2269307 if public clamor for wage legislation is very strong lawmakers would be pressured to heed the workers demand
2269308 youre going to need a bigger wheelbarrow for all the money
2269309 hey youre an idiot do you really want to do that
2269310 i have not read the report yet so i can only answer on principle but i can imagine that there are many possibilities of tax evasion in many sectors
2269311 what i can say about forestry is that the commission in charge of setting the minimum export prices for timber has not met since 2000 so the logging companies took advantage of the situation to export timber at a price under its real value it means that the congolese government has suffered losses in terms of foreign currency earnings and taxes
2269312 for years greenpeace has been attempting to tarnish the reputation of danzer group by floating rumours making defamatory statements and spreading half truths but constantly repeating false concocted allegations does not make them true
2269313 the swiss attorney generals office and the examining magistrates office of zug switzerland dropped charges against danzer group filed by greenpeace in 2004 and 2006
2269314 a very unsatisfactory situation made more so by the shadow it casts over the good performances across a wide range of our businesses
2269315 we recognise that we must now deliver a level of performance that meets their expectations for the company and restores value to our shares we are determined to do so and this is our focus
2269316 he would be out of the door quicker than it takes to say abn was the wrong deal at the wrong price at the wrong time
2269317 it would have been better if they had done that

2269326 hey valued customer you just ordered something on our site we took your order but now we cant get you what you wanted dont worry though now we have your details well be sure to get around to sorting you out at some unspecified time in the future of our choosing tosser
2269327 you know when you ordered something and we told you it was in stock well we lied but we know youll sit around waiting so well try to do something about it when we can be arsed and youll just have to guess when that might be oh yeah and heres the date we lied about when we said we would get it to you just so you can imagine what it would have been like to actually get the thing just to rub it in a little bit more

2269431 one of these days someone may need a favor from you be sure to remember when the time comes
2269432 gray was one of the good guys he was knowledgeable gracious easy to work with and you could always count on a hand shake deal to be honored he truly will be missed
2269433 gray called me just about every friday to ask what are you seeing at which time we would discuss the state of the austin bankruptcy market and the crazy outrageous or comical things the young pups were doing gray was someone whose call i was always happy to take because it was almost invariably upbeat and informative he was a great fan of history he knew all about my distant relative being defenestrated in prague and he was an avid birder i hate that i did not call him last week to tell him i had just seen a nesting pair of black bellied whistling ducks on my brothers stock tank he would have told me their range mating habits and maybe their call i always envied grays ability to get an adverse ruling or criticism without over reacting most of the time he would just chuckle and say you may be right ill think about that i could learn from that he will be especially missed by those of us who are his contemporaries a dwindling number
2269434 i tried the first contested bankruptcy matter of my career against gray before judge elliott in 1983
2269435 im not sure that i ever met a man that enjoyed life more fully or exuded more joy in his life than gray jolink
2269436 the last time i talked with gray was after a court hearing one day last week
2269437 gray viewed the practice of law as a profession a way to help people and not just a business to be run for profit and he always conducted himself in that mode always the gentleman
2269438 and to allah prostrates whoever is within the heavens and the earth willingly or by compulsion and their shadows as well in the mornings and the afternoons

2269440 o you who have believed shall i guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment it is that you believe in allah and his messenger and strive in the cause of allah with your wealth and your lives that is best for you if you should know he will forgive for you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence that is the great attainment and you will obtain another favor that you love victory from allah and an imminent conquest and give good tidings to the believers

2269444 1 the claimant must have engaged in inequitable conduct 2 the misconduct must have resulted in injury to the creditors of the bankrupt or conferred an unfair advantage on the claimant and 3 equitable subordination of the claim must not be inconsistent with the provisions of the bankruptcy code
2269445 a claim should be subordinated only to the extent necessary to offset the harm which the debtor or its creditors have suffered as a result of the inequitable conduct
2269446 however the bankruptcy court made no finding of harm and the record does not support a finding that either the debtor or the unsecured creditors were harmed by the november transaction
2269447 because the loan proceeds were used to pay current unsecured creditors unsecured creditors as a class were not harmed when the wooleys obtained security for for the november loan the general unsecured creditors who were paid from the proceeds of the november loan may have benefitted to the detriment of another group of unsecured creditors but this does not mean that unsecured creditors were harmed when the wooleys obtained security for their loan
2269448 deepening insolvency has been defined as prolonging an insolvent corporations life through bad debt causing the dissipation of corporate assets
2269449 a deepening insolvency theory of damages has been criticized and rejected by many courts
2269450 the bankruptcy court found that the insiders conduct harmed herbys outside creditors by significantly increasing their trade credit exposure and by reducing their ultimate dividend in the liquidation most importantly the court found that the insiders had secured an unfair advantage by structuring their cash contributions to herbys as loans rather than as equity capital if the insiders were allowed to retain their ranking as unsecured creditors they would have gained an advantage in the priority scheme by encouraging outside creditors to increase their credit to herbys their efforts were successful those trade creditors substantially increased their credit to herbys during the period in question

2269474 will they help us subvert the constitution by making this law permanent or will they force us to write things down thereby limiting our ability to collect this intelligence and stay a step ahead of the liberals who want to attack us
2269475 we have gotten information from these high value detainees that have helped protect you
2269476 the american people expect their government to take action to protect them from being slaughtered in their beds by the murderous brown horde of evildoers who hate their freedoms and want them to vote for democrats
2269477 have been fully disclosed to appropriate members of the united states congress
2269478 the policy of the united states and the practices do not constitute torture
2269479 i just fundamentally disagree that that would be a good thing for national security
2269480 i think the american people are stupid enough to believe that there are secret needs that the federal government has to keep certain information about what were not doing private we cannot provide more information about techniques were not using its not appropriate
2269481 why should the public have confidence that anything these cocksuckers do is either legal or in the best interests of the united states
2269482 ive had the awful responsibility to have to work with the new york times and other islamofascist propaganda organizations on stories that involve the release of classified information and i can tell you that every time ive dealt with any of these stories i have felt that we have chipped away at the safety and security of our decider

2269486 a new species is arising on the planet it is arising now and you are it
2269487 we are in the midst of a momentous event in the evolution of human consciousness but they wont be talking about it in the news tonight on our planet and perhaps simultaneously in many parts of our galaxy and beyond consciousness is awakening from the dream of form this does not mean all forms the world are going to dissolve although quite a few almost certainly will it means consciousness can now begin to create form without losing itself in it it can remain conscious of itself even while it creates and experiences form

2269490 rejection is a writers best friend if you are not failing regularly gregg levoy observes in the business of writing you are living so far below your potential that youre failing anyway
2269491 tenacity is essential to success in writing while successs as a writer is a great achievement considerable merit attaches to the effort itself as in athletics training is the struggle victory is merely the affirmation of that struggle

2269499 you wont have to worry about paying the fine because im going to send you to jail
2269500 we are greatly encouraged by the thoughts and prayers of american homeschoolers
2269501 it gives us hope to know that there are people who have the freedom to educate their own children at home we so appreciate the letters and notes of encouragement these letters help us maintain our focus and in seeking gods will for our family
2269502 germanys approach to home schooling compromises this european law on mobility and forces families to choose between a job and the best interests of the children the need for family friendly employment policies must be recognized throughout the eu we need to have flexibility in the education of children temporarily resident because of work there is also an issue around the attitude to non german families in the german childrens courts i hope the dialogue between the commission and the german state will resolve this discriminatory situation
2269503 imprisonment or fines in this matter are absolutely excessive in my opinion because homeschooling can provide very high quality outcomes this topic is definitely one which we must work through politically there can be no black white declarations but we must discuss this without ideological blinders on
2269504 this poor simple family is being crushed by unbearable pressure from the german states police power primarily because they are homeschoolers
2269505 this father of nine a woodworker told me how difficult this is and the incredible strain its placing on his children his wife and himself as longtime homeschoolers they have irritated the local youth authorities who needed only the pretext of the hospitalization of the mother and other exaggerated claims to seize the children
2269506 while there are some policy makers in some of the states who are willing to take on this important issue of human rights most couldnt be bothered it is going to take increased public awareness and international pressure to confront german society with this outrageous behavior unfortunately it looks like more parents will have to go to jail and more children taken into state custody before german public policy makers wake up and do something its very disturbing that germany can get away with this kind of behavior with such little public comment by other western governments

2269518 define develop and implement common customer management practices across the general insurance business segments
2269519 our current estimates presume an ultimate loss of about 8 billion on the combined portfolios of the insurance companies investments and the aig financial products credit default swaps
2269520 this compares to reported accounting losses of more than 25 billion over the last three quarters
2269521 this discrepancy implies that significant recoveries are likely but given the stagnant nature of any market recovery it is unlikely that any gains on the portfolios will occur before late 2009 or 2010
2269522 recoveries would emerge in late 2008 however the sizeable capital raise of more than 20 billion during the second quarter diffuses the impact of this likely temporary loss
2269523 about aigs large securities lending program which amounted to 64 billion as of dec 31 2007 aig invested the proceeds of this program in largely subprime and alt a mortgage backed securities with a duration far longer than the liabilities that they support which we consider higher risk than most other insurance company programs
2269524 securities are now experiencing large market value losses despite a large majority still being very highly rated this also is a consequence of the current market disruption and the losses are included in our current loss estimate for the company although the magnitude of the market value losses is large it is reasonable given the size of aigs capital base following their recent capital raise

2269536 how do you come up with your novel plots where do you find those ideas
2269537 were not getting our moneys worth when we have so many complaints about innocent people being shot
2269538 and its unclear whether theyre actually being investigated by the state department because the presidents girlfriend runs that joint and the bitch wont tell us anything
2269539 but we as a private organization cant do any more
2269540 we cant flog him we cant incarcerate him if he was some random iraqi we could shoot him in the back of the head and ditch him in the street and he wouldnt even make the count what do you want from me money
2269541 the presidents girlfriend has made clear that she wishes to have a probing comprehensive unvarnished examination of the overall issue of security contractors working for her in iraq
2269542 which will be much better for us than any kind of investigation of specific events
2269543 tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
2269544 we all got our poison man you just gots to know yours
2269545 were at a crossroads you weaklings pour it on seize the moment and be like us show you have the balls to do what we want and take withdrawal off the table

2269547 so were going to be campaigning across the heartland of america and talking about the issues that are challenging america today
2269548 hes cashing in on 9 11 like its his own personal tragedy its a photo op on a campaign swing for him
2269549 they should have every other single presidential candidate then because this is outrageous
2269550 this is going to be seen across the country as a blanket endorsement from us its totally inappropriate
2269551 if you know rudy giuliani hed be down there paying his respects whether he was invited or not
2269552 this is something that happened to him as a person as a new yorker as a mayor and as an american to say hes politicizing it marone he would never do anything like that and i will fucking kill anyone who says he would
2269553 iowa for good reason for constitutional reasons for reasons related to the lord should be the first caucus and primary
2269554 and i want you to know who was the first candidate to sign a pledge not to campaign anywhere if they got ahead of iowa it was bill richardson
2269555 look that was an off the cuff comment where i was sucking up to the locals so i said iowa and new hampshire should be first because i really want people here to like me if i dont pull at least third place here im toast
2269556 iowa scrutinizes candidates through a grass roots state they are very good at winnowing down candidates
2269557 they dont listen to national polls iowa voters are very independent and issue oriented and theyll never go for a fat half breed if i dont kiss their ass a little bit
2269558 i think its important to stay positive in this campaign
2269559 isnt iowa great god loves you people more than anyone
2269560 i dont like to be typecast im very proud to be hispanic but if i used my mothers maiden name like everyone else it would be so obvious that im trying to just do it for votes

2269565 please check your internet connection your pc appears to be offline
2269566 owch that hurts stop that what are you doing you idiot
2269567 lying down with a good book or a virtual world
2269568 we cannot compete with gunpowder enjoy the show and we will resume when it is done
2269569 if thats what youre passionate about and your gut tells you that theres something there go for it
2269570 this is a very good site maybe you could have more pictures
2269571 gad look at that winner with his own yacht and penthouse and infinite free time wed love to have some of that stuff why arent we brave enough to take the exam and maybe be a winner too
2269572 to keep them damn poah people from votin erhh ah mean from committin election fraud uhh ah mean t keep ennyone from committin election fraud yah thet was it
2269573 well i dunno its true that the state didnt prove that there was actually any election fraud to prevent but on the other hand the plaintiffs didnt prove there were actually any particular number of poor people that would be burdened and even if the law was enacted mostly to disenfranchise poor people there are other reasons they might have enacted it too so whatever the law stands and heres about six thousand previous decisions with the word vote in them somewhere that one of our clerks found for us on lexis nexis
2269574 now hold on we dont want to be so wussy here even if the plaintiffs
2269575 now theres this pesky poll tax decision in harper v
2269576 so since this law does not put an undue burden on voters in general where by voters in general i mean wealthy white voters who belong to my country club and since discrimination is okay because without proof of discriminatory intent a generally applicable law with disparate impact is not unconstitutional the law stands as should every other law that mostly impacts poor people since poor people arent yet a protected class and you know how i feel about any suggestion that we might create new protected classes
2269577 hm but on that thing about discriminatory intent didnt the main opinion say that there might in fact have been discriminatory intent shouldnt we worry about that a bit
2269578 anyone with a proper respect for stare decisis and quidquid latine dictum sit altum viditur will realize at once that in this case look its halleys comet again whoa
2269579 oh for heavens sake the only even vaugely plausible reason the state could give for this law was to prevent a kind of fraud that no one ever tries to commit and by the most conservative estimate tens of thousands of people will be unable to vote because of it the parallel to the poll tax found unconstitutional in harper is painfully obvious sheesh the law is unconstitutional
2269580 yeah what they said im only writing my own separate dissent because i had some time to kill before lunch here are some precedents
2269581 youre right that was dumb that wasnt what we meant
2269582 i dont think you have any way to enforce that
2269583 first i became aware of myself floating upward then i turned and saw my body lying on the bed
2269584 then there was this intense light and i found myself moving toward it
2269585 right right there was this great feeling of calm and i was moving up this tunnel toward the light and there was this ethereal music and a great feeling of
2269586 of love and a gentle voice telling me i had to return
2269587 ya still got some work to do on attitude but i like that ethereal keep it up
2269588 they live down there are born and live and die

2269592 the finding that male sexual orientation can be accurately perceived in such a short period of time is striking
2269593 although previous work has shown that thin slices of behaviour are remarkably rich in providing information about people none have sliced as thin as 50ms

2269607 having an open source os that is adopted by a broad array of device manufacturers allows the manufacturers to better compete for additional business by allowing sales of games music videos apps and other services even on those devices not manufactured by their own company

2269631 i know that most men including those at ease with problems of the greatest complexity can seldom accept even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as would oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions which they have delighted in explaining to colleagues which they have proudly taught to others and which they have woven thread by thread into the fabric of their lives

2269670 loving turns into loving too much when our partner is inappropriate uncaring or unavailable and yet we cannot give him up in fact we want him we need him even more we will come to understand how our wanting to love our yearning for love our loving itself becomes an addiction
2269671 recent construction crane related accidents in the new york city area have raised understandable concerns about the safety of building sites
2269672 with stricter criminal and civil penalties this new law will send a message that we have zero tolerance for any actions that negatively interfere with the inspection and licensing of construction cranes
2269673 two cranes have fallen on the upper east side within a three month period
2269674 it is disheartening that each collapse has been followed by the arrest of a department of buildings employee for a fraud such as falsifying records or bribery thats why we must put laws on the books that will protect us from events like this occurring again
2269675 we need to ensure that construction is being done in a safe way that protects the innocent bystanders who come near these projects
2269676 we believe that aig is simply too large and complex for anyone to fully understand and that the company could eventually need to be broken into pieces
2269677 aig waded into waters it did not fully understand it is typically an insurer but really spread out into different risky assets that have only now come home to roost
2269678 certainly we would expect the company to diverge itself of some assets and focus on its core business
2269679 we expect aig to refocus efforts on its core insurance units
2269680 the question is are they going to sell their winners and keep their losers
2269681 our experiments prove that it can be done and that is the first step but not the only one to developing a system that is commercially viable
2269682 green dragon award recycled papers can put anything up to 20 on a job so depending on size of job this could be significant as for perfect binding i have several printers as suppliers who do this all in house this will save you considerable money as most printers farm out perfect binding
2269683 we are delighted that the minimill has been recognised by the observer ethical awards wheat straw has been used to make paper in the uk within living memory the clean technology provided by the minimill allows this excellent paper making material to be used again without harming the environment
2269684 they would have been able to operate but they would have had to operate under some pretty strict guidelines under the state as far as identification of the animals and definitely a lot more regulations on how the facilities were kept and the type of facilities the animals were kept in so the public didnt have to worry about safety issues
2269685 unfortunately it looks like weve waited too long and well have to be reactive
2269686 probably in light of the current situation it will probably push from both sides the house and the senate next year
2269687 i would say legislation like that would be a step in the right direction
2269688 this zoo in my district is the only opportunity my local kids have for that kind of exposure
2269689 i want to be real careful we provide every protection there can be without the elimination of this exposure for the kids and people who might not ever have an opportunity to see a wild animal
2269690 then jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples
2269691 this is a worrying incident and is the latest in a number of reports of this nature that we have had recently
2269692 the behaviour of the man driving the vauxhall vectra concerns us greatly and we are keen to trace him as soon as we can
2269693 the man behaving suspiciously in this incident is described as being white aged in his late 30s or early 40s of stocky build and as having a shaved or bald head
2269694 we have spoken to a number of possible witnesses in connection with this particular incident and would encourage anyone who believes they may have useful information to come forward
2269695 we are especially keen to hear from two girls described as being white aged between 12 and 14 and with blonde hair who we believe were approached on the same stretch of road by this same man around half an hour before this latest incident took place
2269696 we would also ask anyone else who recognises the description of this man to come forward with their information as it is thought that he may previously have approached other young girls in south telford in areas such as stirchley and ironbridge
2269697 the pedestrian was walking towards the belle vue area at the time and the driver of the vehicle failed to stop we are anxious to hear from anyone who saw the collision or the circumstances leading up to it and would urge any witnesses to call me at shrewsbury police station on 08457 444888
2269698 it was a real pleasure to visit the pub and to see the excellent work that the landlords there have done in giving the pub a new lease of life
2269699 pubs play a vital part in contributing to the life of the community and im very proud to have such an establishment in my constituency
2269700 barden has been doing a lot of work with the borough councils pride in shrewsbury scheme and gillian burvill from the initiative
2269701 when she heard they were looking to get involved with a youth football project gillian sent them our way and the tournament is the result which has been organised by the shrewsbury local policing league
2269702 the company also gave us enough money that we could buy all the kit including balls bibs and goalkeepers gloves
2269703 there will be a trophy and medals for the winning team and also medals for the runners up at least ten teams are taking part and well also be providing refreshments
2269704 jamie adams one of our csos will be one of the referees and other members of the team will also be at the event to help run things
2269705 the scheme has run for a number of years and is attended by a number of young people
2269706 unfortunately last years bad weather hampered things but many young people still turned up and we all got soaked to the skin the one sunny day we did have around 30 young people turned up at lilleshall
2269707 inflatable football consists of a four sided football pitch with walls that keep the ball in play and goals at each end the walls are inflated bouncy castle style and the young people have great fun the more that attend the better so we can split those who attend into teams and leagues and mini tournaments
2269708 three of the scenarios are run by police officers and it seems many of these proved popular with the children who came along
2269709 we were supported by all the bridgnorth section community support officers and various local police officers from the south of the division who pulled out all the stops to get our message across in a fun but impactive way
2269710 the response from the kids at shifnal primary shows just how important these events are and the impact it has had on children
2269711 the stranger danger scenario proved very popular as this was a real life demonstration where the kids were led away by someone claiming to be from spring watch it really showed the pupils how easy it could be and drove home the message for them never to go off with anybody they do not know
2269712 the cat had been let out at around 4 30pm but was found injured around half an hour later its believed the animal was shot with an air pellet weapon
2269713 the injuries the cat received are very serious and we would appeal to anyone with information about the incident to contact us
2269714 kapan lagi bisa menghabiskan uang ratusan juta dalam satu hari
2269715 unfortunately opportunist thieves will take risks and will steal items from vehicle seven if the owner is within sight
2269716 the only way motorists can protect their property is to remove all items of value from sight at all times take satellite navigation systems handbags and wallets out of view and lock vehicles at all times where possible
2269717 the unit is very large and thieves would have needed to tow it away
2269718 we are eager to hear from anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area at the time or who saw the unit being towed
2269719 last years floods damaged many local roads and i know how important it is for communities to get those roads repaired
2269720 we are committed to continue working with affected councils as well as providing them with support necessary to carry out repairs
2269721 last years floods were the worst for a generation with some areas getting two or three months of rain in one day
2269722 so this extra government money to help repair roads and bridges is very welcome support for councils who 12 months on are still working hard to help families and businesses get back to normal
2269723 along with the 31 million i am announcing today for 62 flood hit councils to spend as they see fit the funds weve given to local areas now totals 133 million this is a significant contribution to local recovery efforts
2269724 we are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the vicinity of where this theft took place it is quite possible that the offence happened while people were passing by as the thieves may have been wearing high visibility clothing and looked like they were working normally
2269725 however we would ask anyone who saw any individuals moving a set of traffic lights on this stretch of the a518 outside of normal working hours to report this to us so that we can investigate whether the individuals were genuine workmen
2269726 we were made aware of the email and made some enquiries with trading standards and the local tax office we have discovered that the email is not genuine and is nothing more than a scam
2269727 we are particularly concerned because attached to the email is a form for people to fill in the form asks people for a lot of personal details including bank details and pin numbers as well as the persons mothers maiden name if people fill these forms in they are likely to be fleeced
2269728 we would urge people to delete the email immediately and especially not to provide the sender with any personal details if they do they are likely to find their bank account emptied
2269729 its always very important to have at least one victory against everyone that plays out there so im really pleased with that one
2269730 it was fantastic to wake up on monday after silverstone and see the trophy
2269731 to step onto the podium again was an unexpected but deserved outcome to our british grand prix weekend and i was so pleased to have achieved the result for the team
2269732 however we have to keep our focus and continue to improve the performance of the car as we are fully aware that our result at silverstone was assisted by the wet conditions
2269733 with changeable weather this weekend it can make for an exciting race and overtaking is possible particularly under heavy braking
2269734 the layout changes mean it is a different venue now from the track that i used to enjoy so much however its still a good circuit
2269735 silverstone gave us the opportunity to combine driver experience and team performance to achieve a very well deserved podium finish
2269736 the team worked extremely well throughout the race to take advantage of the opportunities which opened up aided by an excellent drive and outstanding tyre feedback from rubens
2269737 our first podium of the season was of course a big morale boost however it would be unrealistic to expect a repeat of this result in dry track conditions
2269738 but with changeable weather predicted for the weekend as rubens has mentioned it could be an interesting race
2269739 a particular kind of political violence that is usually associated with the use or threat of use of violent behavior to achieve political ends although terrorism can be and often is perpetrated by states the term is most frequently associated with non state entities seeking to overthrow or effectively destabilize a regime
2269740 an undeniable defining characteristic of terrorism is that it often involves the deliberate targeting of civilians as the immediate means towards the ultimate objectives of the terrorist movement
2269741 a key feature of terrorism is that it is a form of psychological warfare
2269742 a common strategy of terrorists is to provoke an overreaction frequently involving excessive measures by governments challenged by terrorists from the end target in an attempt to undermine its morality and legitimacy while simultaneously increasing support for terrorists among their sympathizers
2269743 the psyches of terrorists to reveal what motivates their monstrous acts
2269744 the social milieu in which a person grew up and the internal structure of the radical groups themselves exert a tremendous influence
2269745 in middle eastern cultures extremist political goals frequently are inculcated into young people very early in life
2269746 religiously motivated islamist terrorists were more committed to self sacrifice than were less religious perpetrators

2269768 political leaders seem intent on suppressing and ignoring the strong evidence that biofuel are a major factor in recent food price rises
2269769 rapid income growth in developing countries has not led to large increases in global grain consumption and was not a major factor responsible for the large price increases
2269770 the us biofuel strategy has greatly affected the global grain supply
2269771 now is the time to open up the arctic national wildlife refuge so that we can say to the world we will do our part in increasing oil supply

2269782 you can discuss this avalanche of misogyny without endorsing her campaign
2269783 they think theres no real risk involved that theyll get away with a slap on the wrist if theyre caught
2269784 i really thought i was untouchable and then i got stupid and careless
2269785 those in it for the science and those in it for the money
2269786 in the 80s if you werent in iguanas you werent anybody
2269787 a lot of companies offered all of the bread and butter animals strictly had all that plus a lot of specialty items like little expensive jewels that might make a pet shop stand out
2269788 its like art by god we perfect mutations that are biologically worthless to meet the public desire to own a piece of nature
2269789 if he goes back to jail that would be an accomplishment
2269790 theyve been responsible for bringing in a tremendous amount of new things that breeders wouldnt otherwise have
2269791 there are a lot of great animals in collections and zoos because of these people
2269792 i was breeding rhino iguanas which are endangered and really rare and people started smuggling them in and all of a sudden they are all over the place and they are selling them for a third of what im producing them for
2269793 he was known as a guy who would pay clean take big loads and not ask any questions he would take everything so you wouldnt give it to somebody else he dominated the field by having what no one else had
2269794 id get competitors calling me up and saying how the hell did he get hold of that
2269795 when id ask mike about the animals he would just look me in the eye and i would kind of feel like he was laughing at me hed been getting away with smuggling for so long that he believed nothing could ever happen to him unfortunately once the animals in the country its nearly impossible to prove where it came from
2269796 the source countries for a lot of endangered species are often the same as for drugs
2269797 there is a logistical reason why drugs and animals are lumped together its very easy to get wildlife products into the country if youre shipping something that says its full of snakes its easy to put in a false bottom filled with cocaine we found there was a 5 percent chance of wildlife being inspected by customs and if you are shipping drugs and rare animals together youre making money on both ends
2269798 i sat in mike and rays office and i said man fish and wildlife will have to smack me right out of the sky because right now im a meteorite i wanted to smuggle as many animals as i could as much as i could as far as i was concerned whatever it was i wanted to get it in i didnt care i didnt know anybody who had real trouble i figured if i get caught what are you going to do slap me on the wrist make me pay a fine i had no idea what federal court was about
2269799 the first time i went down there i sold them some stuff and they helped me package my first shipment that i sent to another guy
2269800 but in other countries its just the way they do business now you cant have an american guy go pay off a guy but you give money to an egyptian and he gives the money to another egyptian and all of a sudden youve got your permits thats the live animal business thats the way it goes
2269801 you tell them how much you want to take out and that you are not going to be detrimental to the population
2269802 paraguay was closed and i got the first shipments out last year the only problem is that once you open a place up within six or eight months everybodys jumped in
2269803 i changed the name instead of iguanas i called them blue jewels and i charged 2 more for each iguana it worked every once in a while wed get a batch of iguanas that were electric blue because maybe the breeder fed them different food or something and so wed call them electric blue and sell them for 20 each
2269804 rule number one on the street is you cant beat the government

2269889 outcomes of planned home births with certified professional midwives large prospective study in north america
2269890 we challenge u s physician organizations to acknowledge the findings of this study and others like it and to actively support legislative and regulatory changes that will promote access to out of hospital maternity care provided by professional independent midwives such as certified professional midwives
2269891 had a low mortality rate during labor and delivery similar to rates found in most studies of low risk hospital births in north america
2269892 rates of medical intervention such as epidural forceps and caesarean section were lower for planned home births than for low risk hospital births
2269893 a high degree of safety and maternal satisfaction were reported and over 87 of mothers and babies did not require transfer to hospital
2269894 oh josh sure did know a lot about that one system you know with the operating system they dont use anymore
2269895 now that josh he was a good person he was there for me when no one else was he really opened my eyes and helped me see things from a perspective i hadnt considered before ill always remember the impact he had on me
2269896 welcome any positive proposal that supports network rails board accountable to its members to continue with its objectives of exercising best practice in corporate governance
2269897 network rail has achieved much since it took over from the failed former licence holder railtrack our not for dividend model has delivered year on year improvements for passengers and freight operators network rail has cut the costs of operating and maintaining the railway
2269898 it is high time we ended the fat controller bonuses at network rail where the bosses reap huge rewards regardless of performance failures
2269899 we played against opponent last season and number was an excellent player not sure if she he graduated or not but if not she he will be one of the top players in the state
2269900 its nice to have him fit because players always want to play and it will have been hard for daniel to deal with not being fit for so long
2269901 it must have been devastating for him to be out for almost a whole season
2269902 it is not something i would really know about because i have never suffered that kind of thing but im sure it was very difficult for him
2269903 but i am really glad that he is back and he can help the team to win trophies
2269904 i am sure the manager is happy because it means he has five centre backs to choose from now
2269905 that means we all have to fight for our place but that is the way it has always been at liverpool and this season will be no different
2269906 it is good to have that kind of challenge though i will be fighting for my place and i am sure the other defenders will be doing exactly the same
2269907 at a club like liverpool there is always massive competition to get into the starting xi because of the players we have for each position but that is good and it can only improve the team
2269908 we are trying to fight for every title and we have more possibilities this season
2269909 i always had it in the back of my mind to get freddie back into the team he just needed another game to prove to himself
2269910 hes got through a good game against hampshire for lancashire and hes ready to come back
2269911 i think we are building him up a bit too much i think its a bit unfair on him
2269912 hes not a wizard hes not going to come and sprinkle dust hes just going to come and perform how he can
2269913 but he does have that bit of x factor about him you know when you give him the ball he can create something and in the past when hes gone out to bat hes made things happen he also has the ability to take wonderful catches
2269914 his stature in the dressing room is also important and im sure opposition teams around the world would rather play england without freddie flintoff than with him
2269915 im tired of cooking it depresses me every time i face the kitchen it reminds me of all the changes weve had to make because of my pkd and i hate having pkd
2269916 if they bowl well its going to be hard work but if theyre slightly off line there may well be more opportunities to score than say the new zealand bowlers who were very disciplined but with not quite so much pace
2269917 all it boils down to in the end is how well theyre going to bowl and how clear you are in your gameplan about how youre going to counteract that
2269918 the new zealand series which england won 2 0 tested us in very different ways that attritional type of cricket in some ways is harder to play because youre fighting with yourself a lot of the time whereas against south africa youre pitting yourself against the opposition a little bit more
2269919 theyre trying to get you out youre trying not to give an inch in your own right i think the opening batsmen have got a crucial role to play against their bowling attack both alastair cook and i are aware of that and the fact we need to do well to help out the team and if we do that it will provide a good platform for the others to go out and play their shots
2269920 from my point of view it was fantastic to be able to face them before the test series and start formulating game plans and how youre going to play the individual bowlers
2269921 i was keen to play in that game i thought there was a lot more benefits to playing than possible negatives so it just seemed like the right thing to do and im pleased i did it
2269922 most conventions wouldnt spend 10 on a badge most would probably spend 10 cents

2269925 important people politicians and industrialists and businessmen who toe the line with them will continue to get the best medical care the rest of us will wait in a line the only way the line will move forward is when the dead are pulled out of the line in front of you
2269926 do you know what it takes to perform a brain operation do you know the skill it demands and the years of passionate merciless excruciating devotion that go to acquire that skill that was what i would not place at the disposal of men whose sole qualification to rule me was their capacity to spout the fraudulent generalities that got them elected to the privilege of enforcing their wishes at the point of a gun i would not let them dictate the purpose for which my years of study had been spent or the conditions of my work or my choice of patients or the amount of my reward i observed that in all the discussions that preceded the enslavement of medicine men discussed everything except the desires of the doctors men considered only the welfare of the patients with no thought for those who were to provide it that a doctor should have any right desire or choice in the matter was regarded as irrelevant selfishness his is not to choose they said only to serve that a man willing to work under compulsion is too dangerous a brute to entrust with a job in the stockyards never occurred to those who proposed to help the sick by making life impossible for the healthy i have often wondered at the smugness with which people assert their right to enslave me to control my work to force my will to violate my conscience to stifle my mind yet what is it that they expect to depend on when they lie on the operating table under my hands their moral code has taught them to believe that it is safe to rely on the virtue of their victims well that is the virtue i have withdrawn let them discover in their operating rooms and hospital wards that it is not safe to place their lives in the hands of a man whose life they have throttled it is not safe if hes the sort of man who resents it and still less safe if hes the sort who doesnt

2269929 i think its a fair question for people to ask what do you believe and i think if you want to understand what i believe you could recognize that the values that i have are the same values youll find in faiths across this country i believe in god believe in the bible believe jesus christ is my savior i believe that god created man in his image i believe that the freedoms of man derive from inalienable rights that were given to us by god
2269930 i say to you today my friends so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow i still have a dream it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream
2269931 rather we argue that there is an optimal level of mess for every aspect of every system that is in any situation there is a type and level of mess at which effectiveness is maximized and our assertion is that people and organizations frequently err on the side of over organization most people simply assume theyre on the overly messy and disorganized side of the line and would do well to drag themselves in the direction of neatness and order

2269941 marcus has been an exceptional representative of the nuggets both on the court and in the denver community during his time here and we are greatly appreciative of all he has done
2269942 this trade exception along with the future first round draft choice we received from charlotte last month gives us a number of options and a tremendous amount of flexibility
2269943 i love this acquisition for the current makeup of our team
2269944 we are getting a consummate pro who is maybe the best team defender in the league and who has 60 playoff games under his belt
2269945 i think this is a very good addition for us especially since were getting a player who can really help us without having to give up a player in return
2269946 marcus can play multiple positions and is one of the better rebounders and shot blockers in the league
2269947 with him playing alongside chris kaman i think we will have a pair of excellent interior defenders and that will make us a formidable team

2269982 im committed to adding more minnesota players to the thunder roster
2269983 this youth initiative will help us identify and develop future thunder and lightning first team prospects
2269984 in the united states many high potential athletes are prohibited from taking advantage of professional level training due to financial restraints a goal of the thunder academy is to provide cost reduction and eventual program cost elimination for all players through thunder partnerships and sponsorships
2269985 my goal in life is to have my kid play for the thunder or lightning
2269986 for the good or for the bad right or wrong things have changed dramatically over the last 10 years and player development options are accelerating at an even faster pace its a different world we all live in today if a child parent family wants to play for the cc great and best wishes if a child parent family wants to puruse other options that may inlcude driving across town and writing a bunch more checks great and best wishes whos to say what is right or wrong for another
2269987 for my own benefit i have helped change things dramatically over the last 10 years and and have helped accelerate player development options at an even faster pace its a different world we all live in today if a child isnt very good and wants to play for the cc great we dont want them if a child is really good they should play for me and my club because no one can develop a kid as well as i can so parents need to pay me lots of money and ill look good im right and youre wrong
