2810000 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2810001 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2810002 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2810003 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2810004 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2810005 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2810006 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2810007 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2810008 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2810009 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2810010 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2810011 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2810012 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2810013 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2810014 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2810015 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2810016 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2810017 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2810018 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2810019 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2810020 there you go again thats exactly the politics of division that has led us to where we are in washington
2810021 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2810022 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2810023 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2810024 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2810025 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2810026 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2810027 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2810028 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2810029 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2810030 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2810031 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2810032 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2810033 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2810034 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2810035 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2810036 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2810037 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2810038 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2810039 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2810040 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2810041 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2810042 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2810043 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2810044 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2810045 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2810046 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2810047 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2810048 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2810049 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2810050 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2810051 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2810052 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2810053 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2810054 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2810055 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2810056 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2810057 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2810058 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2810059 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2810060 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2810061 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2810062 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2810063 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2810064 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2810065 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2810066 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2810067 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2810068 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2810069 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2810070 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2810071 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2810072 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2810073 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2810074 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2810075 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2810076 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2810077 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2810078 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2810079 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2810080 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2810081 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2810082 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2810083 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2810084 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2810085 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2810086 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful

2810088 you guys told me it was a skin condition i thought i was talking to a brother
2810089 its presumptuous it demonstrates a continuation of this notion that the african american community unlike any other is completely monolithic that everyone in the african american community does the same thing in lockstep in contrast to any other group i mean i dont remember seeing john kerry on tv and anybody saying to him i cant believe youre not for hillary clinton why
2810090 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2810091 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2810092 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2810093 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2810094 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2810095 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2810096 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2810097 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2810098 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2810099 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2810100 vamos a hacer prevalecer el detalle t cnico que hemos establecido para hacer prevalecer un criterio de igualdad
2810101 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2810102 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2810103 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2810104 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2810105 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2810106 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2810107 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2810108 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2810109 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2810110 n either post national political reporter jonathan weisman nor milbank called the source
2810111 house democratic aides got up thursday morning and decided that the quotes looked bad while not challenging the quotations themselves they said that the quotes were out of context this is interesting because our source who was among the people complaining about the quotes yesterday sent us the quotes in writing in an email wednesday night evidently no recording was made so well probably never know the exact wording
2810112 my colleague jonathan weisman and i believe the quote was correct as written and that this supposed context is a recreation after the fact by democratic aides who were worried about how the quote looked perhaps obama didnt mean for it to come out that way but theres every reason to believe it did
2810113 house leadership aides pushed back against interpretations of this comment as self aggrandizing saying that when the presumptive democratic nominee said i have become a symbol of the possibility of america he was actually trying to deflect attention from himself
2810114 i cant say whether the first rendition was more accurate than the second i can say those providing the second rendition had good reason to supply context that would nullify the first i can also say i trust the suppliers of both renditions
2810115 an understanding going back years that he is giving me privileged information from closed meetings it is by definition on background with someone you interact with constantly there just arent the formalities of sourcing on every conversation and e mail
2810116 unimpeachable when he gives you a quote you can take it to the bank you dont need to go around verifying it with others

2810124 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2810125 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2810126 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2810127 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law

2810136 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
2810137 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
2810138 weve had 35 new competitors coming out of china in the last 18 months

2810147 a large literature has been spent on the american exception but the only exceptionality that really matterssince all nations are in their way sui generisis the configuration that has founded its global hegemony how is this best expressed it lies in the virtually perfect fit the country offers between optimal geographical and optimal social conditions for capitalist development that is a continental scale of territory resources and market protected by two oceans that no other nation state comes near to possessing and a settler immigrant population forming a society with virtually no pre capitalist past apart from its local inhabitants slaves and religious creeds and bound only by the abstractions of a democratic ideology here are to be found all the requirements for spectacular economic growth military power and cultural penetration politically since capital has always lorded it over labour to an extent unknown in other advanced industrial societies the result is a domestic landscape well to the right of them

2810170 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2810171 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2810172 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2810173 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2810174 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2810175 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2810176 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2810177 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2810178 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2810179 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2810180 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2810181 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2810182 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2810183 its something akin to martial law in that particular area
2810184 it got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we didnt do something
2810185 in a way i like it because they shot up my house too
2810186 and in a way i dont like it because a few minutes ago i had to walk to the store and the police stopped me and asked me what i was doing and where i was going
2810187 first such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the united states barring riot insurrection or natural disaster
2810188 not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city
2810189 notwithstanding the city code and curfew order the residents of helena west helenahave the right to sit under shade trees in their front yard to ride their bicycles along the streets protest this policy and drive around the city with the full protections of the first fourth and fourteenth amendments
2810190 i invite them to move in on second street and be up all nightwith people shooting at them
2810191 since this began its more quiet and peaceful around here
2810192 i think theyre doing a wonderful job prior to this the kids were dealing drugs right in the middle of the street stopping cars saying hey hey what you got
2810193 you couldnt walk down the streets your little kids couldnt either we were just that scared
2810194 youre not free and youre supposed to be free you cant go outside and walk the streets look the entire area is empty theres nobody out here
2810195 were grown and the mayors trying to give us a curfew
2810196 ronald scott the citys assistant police chief said police are using common sense whendealing with pedestrians in the lockdown area

2810217 experimental tones for the first time in utadas discography something that would display itself fruitfully in all the heart station eras singles
2810218 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now

2810221 you make me want to be a man junior jack mix
2810222 the younger voters coming on line tend to be postmodern theologically to the extent they are theological at all and tend to lean leftward in their politics
2810223 i think what is diminishing is a secular approach to politics and whats arising is a faith based approach to politics and now i think we have the opportunity in this country for the great debate between a right leaning limited government low taxes anti abortion type of faith based politics and then the more left leaning version of that on the other side
2810224 as a christian i have written a book about another mans faith and im intrigued by his faith
2810225 i want to encourage his faith and i believe he is sincere about his faith now people who share my political vies are upset with me because i have written this book and basically what they are saying is you are too christian you should be more republican than you are christian what i have written is an honest objective evaluation that celebrates faith to the extent it can be celebrated questioned it where it had to be questioned and basically tries to explain it in terms of our times which is something we need by the way as we approach this election
2810226 i have to say that one of my goals for this book besides just the content was to find the tone that i hope will be replicated a bit more in american politics
2810227 this vicious left right fighting that is happening in america is paralyzing us it is keeping up from accomplishing anything and i have to say as a christian it is ungodly my hope was to write a book that would model a certain tone while communicating facts that people need to know
2810228 as well as one of the most successful debut single to be release in the country 13 the success of utadas singles eventually lead the album
2810229 addicted to you the first single from the album breaking the one million mark in its first week and reaching 1 on the oricon singles chart for two consecutive weeks a personal first and eventually netting sales of 1 784 000 copies remaining utadas most successful single of all time
2810230 experimental tones for the first time in utadas discography something that would display itself fruitfully in all the heart station eras singles
2810231 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now
2810232 was released at the end of june 2005 and featured remixes from jj flores and peter bailey
2810233 you make me want to be a man bloodshy amp avant mix
2810234 you make me want to be a man junior jack mix
2810235 i was not shooting with a tripod i was not shooting with a flash
2810236 thomas hawk was forcibly removed from the san francisco moma by two security guards at the direction of the over zealous simon blint director of visitor relations
2810237 i worked with this douche at zeum one block down from sf moma i can attest to his short temper and general lack of people skills he found no trouble in bullying the teens who worked there
2810238 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2810239 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2810240 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2810241 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2810242 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2810243 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2810244 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2810245 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2810246 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2810247 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2810248 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2810249 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2810250 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2810251 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2810252 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2810253 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2810254 i tell you the truth unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
2810255 let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these
2810256 whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me
2810257 i praise you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children yes father for this was your good pleasure
2810258 the fact that we have got light at the end of the tunnel
2810259 that she knew both ruby and oswald and had seen them sitting together on occasions at rubys club
2810260 that several nurses employed at jackson mental hospital who were watching television along with rose cherami the day kennedy was assassinated stated that during the telecast moments before kennedy was shot rose cherami stated to them this is when it is going to happen and at that moment kennedy was assassinated
2810261 shown a group of photographs which included a photograph of jack ruby mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with he person she had observed she was then shown a photograph of ruby and she advised the person in the truck had a rather large round face similar to rubys but she could not identify him as the person
2810262 because i did pick out rubys picture also this report does not mention the fact that the fbi showed me rubys picture on november 23rd the day before he shot lee oswald
2810263 the truck was plain and had no letters whatsoever painted on it
2810264 that affidavit also has me stating with regard to the driver that i could not see him too clearly that is not true i saw the driver very clearly i looked right in his face and he looked at me twice it was jack ruby
2810265 i was not asked to testify before the warren commission
2810266 ruby was unquestionably familiar if not friendly with some chicago criminals
2810267 if ruby killed lee harvey oswald on orders the man to talk to would be joe savella properly civello then head of syndicate operations in dallas
2810268 in fact a pay off or liaison man between organized crime and the dallas police department over half of whose policemen ruby knew personally
2810269 a large narcotics setup operating between mexico texas and the east in some fashion james breen got the okay to operate through jack ruby of dallas
2810270 that in order to operate in dallas it was necessary to have the clearance of jack ruby who had the fix with the county authorities
2810271 the evidence does not establish a significant link between ruby and organized crime
2810272 my verbal statements to you how do you know if i am tell ing the truth
2810273 i would like to be able to get a lie detector test or truth serum of what motivated me to do what i did at that particular time and it seems as you get further into something even though you know what you did it operates against you somehow brainwashes you that you are weak in what you want to tell the truth about and what you want to say which is the truth
2810274 you are weak in what you want to tell the truth about
2810275 since i have a spotty background in the nightclub business i should have been the last person to ever want to do something that i had been involved in
2810276 you tell us what you want and then we will ask you some questions
2810277 well it is too bad chief warren that you didnt get me to your headquarters six months ago
2810278 it is a greater premeditation than you know is true
2810279 you would like to have built it up for my defense but that is not it i am here to tell the truth
2810280 the most heartbreaking letter to caroline kennedy and alongside that letter a small comment in the newspaper that that mrs kennedy might have to come back for the trial of lee harvey oswald that caused me to do what i did that caused me to go like i did
2810281 i never spoke to anyone about attempting to do anything no subversive organization gave me any idea no underworld person made any effort to contact me it all happened that sunday morning
2810282 a little girl she wanted some money that worked for me
2810283 i didnt linger in there i didnt crouch or hide behind anyone unless the television camera can make it seem that way there was an officer talking i dont know what rank he had talking to a sam pease in a car parked up on the curb
2810284 i think i used the words you killed my president you rat the next thing i knew i was down on the floor
2810285 he was a key man over the tropicana down there
2810286 that was during our good times was in harmony with our enemy of the present time
2810287 i even called a mr hold it before i say it headed the american federation of labor i cant think in the state of texas miller
2810288 is there a deutsch i maylor i called a mr maylor here in texas to see if he could help me out
2810289 i knew there was three tippits on the force the only one i knew used to work for special services
2810290 no i am as innocent regarding any conspiracy as any of you gentlemen in the room
2810291 you can get more out of me lets not break up too soon
2810292 when you got to havana who met you in havana
2810293 would you mind telling us anything you have on your mind
2810294 if i cannot get these tests you give the truth tests it is pretty haphazard to tell you the things i should tell you
2810295 that sympathy isnt going to help me because the people that have the power here they have a different verdict get this they already have me as the accused assassin of our beloved president
2810296 now if i sound screwy telling you this then i must be screwy
2810297 a whole new form of government is going to take over the country
2810298 how do you know if the facts i stated about everything i said statements with reference to are the truth or not
2810299 i want to supersede the attorney in stating that i want everything to come out immediately as soon as possible and whoever wants to know the results what the results are i want it to be known regardless of which way it turns
2810300 he had briefly what i call a psychotic depression that is he had evidence of auditory hallucinations and a poorly defined but definite delusional system which waxed and waned during the time of the interview and he had evidence of a severe degree of depression
2810301 yes i do i think that as i have seen him the depressive element has diminished and that the delusional system has become less open and obvious
2810302 the relationship he has with his attorneys tonahill and fowler there are certain kinds of actions and behavior in these two relationships which fit better in my opinion with the continuation of a covert delusional system concerning threats to his race his family based on his presumed activity in a conspiracy than it would with rational realistic appreciation of the factors in his environment
2810303 it possibly could have been his trying to protect in some way an answer from the polygraph
2810304 im trying to be more emphatic with the truth when i close my eyes more than the truth
2810305 in the greater proportion of the time that he answered the question
2810306 i felt that he was aware of the question and that he understood them and that he was giving answers based on an apprehension of reality
2810307 in short he seemed to behave like a man with a well fixed delusional system in which whole areas of his thinking and his behavior are not strongly interfered with by the delusion
2810308 have you an opinion as to what goes on with reference to rubys mental illness that causes him to put faith in mr alexander and no faith in me
2810309 if in fact ruby was mentally competent and sane that there was no indication of deception with regard to the specific relevant pertinent questions of this investigation
2810310 between the assassination and the shooting did anybody you know tell you they knew oswald
2810311 did you first decide to shoot oswald on friday night
2810312 gives worldwide coverage from a european viewpoint with an emphasis on dutch and the not so standard design
2810313 was it wrong to try to get the city back on its feet as quickly as possible
2810314 safety was first and foremost but we werent going to let the terrorists win
2810315 i think that she wanted to push the administration towards regulating greenhouse gases putting caps on carbon dioxide emissions but the white house and the vice presidents office just simply wouldnt allow it
2810316 at times it seemed as if ms whitman had been appointed merely to make the bush administration seem more interested in the environment
2810317 yet if she really disagreed with some of the decisions it seems strange that ms whitman stayed in her job as long as she did
2810318 the you know with regards to bees in particular im not sure whats killing the bees im not sure whats killing the birds or the bees
2810319 we surveyed a few states and figured out that half to three fourths of a million bee colonies have died this is no urban legend it is serious
2810320 the honeybee is so important for pollination of hundreds of agricultural crops because humans have made it so
2810321 we destroyed the natural pollinators plowed up the area they needed to live and continued to replace their habitats with strip malls and housing developments so farmers have come to rely on honeybees because of mushrooming human populations and our own destructive habits to the natural ecology
2810322 other countries are also experiencing serious declines of honeybee colonies
2810323 but we are not certain that the cause behind the losses here in the united states are the same as those causing losses in other parts of the world
2810324 they die over winter lose queens are destroyed by pests or diseases but this is different as the bees are simply gone and do not develop normally
2810325 the bees are dying and humanity will die shortly after
2810326 albert einstein is believed to have warned if the bee disappears from the surface of the earth man would have no more than four years to live
2810327 in the us beekeepers in california florida and texas have experienced the greatest losses up to 90 percent of their bees
2810328 a german study out of landau university provides preliminary evidence that radiation from cellular phones interferes with bees navigation systems
2810329 what they put in the colony was a cordless phone whoever translated the story didnt know the difference
2810330 no one in the organic beekeeping world is reporting colony collapse
2810331 and despite evidence of their efficacy as crop pollinators wild species are not being exploited to any significant extent
2810332 what you can do about ccd support the organic industry and purchase organic foods this helps to eliminate hazardous pesticides genetically modified organisms and factory farming techniques
2810333 weight obsession is a social disease if we cared more about co2 than bmi there would still be time
2810334 well thats one less thing we have to worry about
2810335 horizontal transfer of viral and bacteria dna facilitated by ge organisms
2810336 you cant solve the problems created by mass consumption with more consumption
2810337 true engagement allows a more complex relationship with the world around you whereas the idea of voting with the dollar simplifies and limits that relationship
2810338 economic growth is incompatible with environmental protection national security and international stability
2810339 economic growth is incompatible with environmental protection national security and international stability
2810340 watch out for that bump i would go backwards if i were you
2810341 weight obsession is a social disease if we cared more about co2 than bmi there might still be time
2810342 parents were so afraid to come to the school they called family members and neighbors whoever had papers to pick up their children
2810343 were all in unison we dont want this type of intimidation immigrants are human beings and need to be dealt with respect
2810344 ice just rolls in and tells our police department after the fact
2810345 the students are upset and crying the schools administration said some of the kids are very shook up
2810346 they are targeting schools and we are watching them do it
2810347 are humans actually aware of the world they live in
2810348 anyone who facilitates the entry of an illegal alien is subject to threes year in jail and a 15 000 financial penalty
2810349 anyone who helps illegal aliens to stay in italy for illegal activities or in order to wrongfully benefit from such an illegal stay shall also be punished with up to four years imprisonment and 15 493 70 financial penalty
2810350 any employer who hires a foreign worker bearing no residence permit for work reasons or whose permit has expired unless the alien has already applied for its renewal or whose permit has been revoked or canceled shall be punished with 3 to 12 months imprisonment and a with a 5000 financial penalty for each hired worker
2810351 the president continues to be in denial he says now he believes that global warming is happening and he accepts the science that it is but if that were so if he truly understood that he could not have come up with a proposal that is aspirational he would have to come up with a commitment that is real
2810352 one thing is clear we must agree on a successor to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 as part of a process led by the united nations there will certainly be other meetings and initiatives before then they can even be helpful what matters is that they all eventually merge into the un process this is non negotiable
2810353 i together with most humans on this planet am not as most ecologist willing to sacrifice my lifestyle
2810354 the so called thermal extinction at the end of the paleocene began when atmospheric co2 was just under 1 000 parts per million ppm at the end of the triassic co2 was just above 1 000 ppm today with co2 around 385 ppm it seems we are still safe but with atmospheric carbon climbing at an annual rate of 2 ppm and expected to accelerate to 3 ppm levels could approach 900 ppm by the end of the next century and conditions that bring about the beginnings of ocean anoxia may be in place how soon after that could there be a new greenhouse extinction that is something our society should never find out
2810355 depois de dizer que leslie apareceria em alguns epis dios o co criador da s rie chuck lorre deve ter decidido que ela necess ria trama especialmente porque h chances de leonard n o engrenar o romance com penny
2810356 oh no this is beautiful jewelry but i really shouldnt

2810358 residual config dialogue does not appear that means you do not have any residual config packages on your machine
2810359 for the moment nothing legally would prevent them junta members from running
2810360 but whether the members or the president run it all depends on what the future dictates
2810361 for now we have other problems to surmount and the main one is holding elections as soon as possible
2810362 what he had done risked driving the country toward catastrophe
2810363 he was acting like a dictator like somebody who wants to ruin the nation
2810364 we told him thats not the way to do things the military chiefs have arms and munitions they have men under their command they are responsible for securing the country and you cannot just fire them all like that
2810365 we are a moderate muslim country we dont want terrorism here
2810366 but we cant release him now for the security of the country

2810376 deswegen waren die ersten spiele vor allem f r uns nationalspieler die fast nur im konditionellen und fitness bereich gearbeitet haben nicht ausschlaggebend f r das was nun am sonntag passiert

2810387 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2810388 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins

2810395 those who have had the honour of knowing master cpl roberts describe him as the embodiment of a brother in the truest sense of the world
2810396 truth honour and loyalty were not mere words to josh but the unspoken creed which he lived his life by
2810397 sadly the sun has set on the life of another true canadian son dear friend and soldier let us never forget his sacrifice
2810398 hes the kind of guy we would describe as a soldiers soldier and i know thats a coined phrase but in actual fact he was one of those real guys
2810399 always carrying his share and more and always looking out for his buddies and comrades any which way quite often they may not have realized it but he was looking after them one way or another
2810400 ey du scheis metaler ich mach dich platt ich geb dir so krass stre dass du nicht mehr weist wo dein haus wohnt

2810404 federal law requires clarke county school administrators to offer students the choice to transfer out of low performing schools but educators lost one way to do that this year when four other districts balked at accepting students the law that requires school districts to give students the choice to transfer also encourages administrators to work out an arrangement with a neighboring district when in district transfers dont make sense for instance when every middle school qualifies as a low performing needs improvement school
2810405 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing china
2810406 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2810407 he reiterated today is that we arent trying to impose something western on china that this is something that naturally develops in a society as it matures
2810408 in the future there will be more room for religious believers
2810409 while i cant confirm this specific report were disappointed any time that someone is unable to worship freely
2810410 the different behavior of chinese and american leaders reflects a different culture
2810411 it would be taken as frivolous in china but is taken as genuine in america
2810412 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations

2810432 its nothing like i thought it would be when i was in high school
2810433 as long as we keep progressing this way i think ill be able to play in a game soon
2810434 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2810435 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does

2810437 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps

2810439 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2810440 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2810441 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2810442 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2810443 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts

2810478 that stuffs bad news you can get addicted you can lose your life
2810479 its a problem to do theory when students just want to get up to speed with dreamweaver
2810480 students can evaluate you badly because they just want skills and they dont like the theory that impacts on you if you are not yet a tenured employee
2810481 students often ask me why they are doing agenda setting and framing but later they say it helped them get jobs because their employers tell them i never thought about it that way
2810482 what we teach is obsolete almost as we teach it the shelf life of skill sets is decreasing all the time thats a major reason for learning theory and critical context
2810483 our grads are well known because the theory has taught them to think at an abstract level
2810484 students get freaked out because they dont yet know how to do dreamweaver but but so what if you have nothing to say on the website you want to build so what hence the relevance of understanding and knowledge
2810485 understanding the political economy of producing within the industry helps prepare them for the control they will encounter there
2810486 if students do skills only and dont like the industry when they get there at least theory gives them something else to fall back on
2810487 students should know they came to a university not a technical school
2810488 i tell those students who complain that actually its more work for me to incorporate the theoretical aspects
2810489 do a concept a week and then integrate it with the skill
2810490 dont use the word theory as if it is esoteric
2810491 assign readings so students do the homework outside of class and discuss it in relation to their practical classes
2810492 get students to analyse their patterns of sourcing and why thats when they really start connecting to the theory of symbolic annihilation
2810493 people learn best by doing so theory also needs to be applied in practice
2810494 if we give no points for students showing that they get the theoretical connection then our include theory rings somewhat hollow
2810495 mules are best known for being stubborn and sterile in some ways they illustrate what happens when man begins to play god all too often we have to acknowledge such a description in many churches

2810655 shes a big time piece of me when it comes to football ive been with three different teams last year we spent almost 40 of the 52 weeks away from each thats part of the lifestyle were able to have some things that a lot people our age cant have like a home and stuff like that we just count our blessings and now we have a kid and we are going to go on from there
2810656 we used skype which allows users to make phone calls and have videoconferences over the internet when i was in nfl europe
2810657 we were able to see each other every day thank god we could because she didnt come over with me and i couldnt see her for four months well use that and ill be able to say good night to him and stuff
2810658 i feel a little better about leaving my wife now because she has a little bit of me with her
2810659 im getting treatment three times a day and i can probably get out there but i wont be my normal self like i know i can and thats what i want to accomplish
2810660 why wouldnt everybody want that for me i think everybody would be a lot happier when im 100 i know my quarterback would so i dont see why everybody else wouldnt feel the same
2810661 the coaches and doctors havent tried to push me on the football field or anything like that but like i said they would love to have me out there they know no one wants to get healthy more than me and im excited about being 100 because i have a pretty good idea of some of things i can do to take my game to the next level so to speak i want that for myself more than anything
2810662 i definitely want to be out there but like i said plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress
2810663 thats what im going to do and im going to make all the right judgments as far as my health and as far as my ankle is concerned before going out on that football field ill assess it and when i get out there ill be running 100 miles per hour without any restrictions thats what im trying to accomplish with me being on the sideline and getting healthy its getting healthy and being explosive by jumping in the air catching balls and thats what im trying to accomplish with what im doing right now
2810664 i walk around in them every day and i have them in right now
2810665 so just taking some time to get used to ive been jogging and im going to run some more routes this afternoon
2810666 its putting my foot in a different position a more normal position where the foot is supposed to be and its just taking some time to get used to but ill be alright im just trying to work the soreness out from the orthopedics and get out there and do my thing
2810667 i know with practice im going to be that much better
2810668 me going out performing catching balls and doing stuff like that doesnt worry me i just want to get in good football shape and basically try to not put myself through the same thing i did last year i told myself i wasnt going to go out and do that because in the long run it just hurts me i have to take care of myself and when im ready to go everybody will know
2810669 manningham is making progress and i hope he can be ready in another week
2810670 i think theyre trying to see if olivea will be able to go at some point this week
2810671 we need to be able to have some opportunities to do a few things at the right time
2810672 we didnt get it off in the scrimmage but we did get it off in the jog through portion of it the problem is that there are a lot of guys that can throw the ball the question is can you throw the ball under pressure and realize that if its not there youve got to put it down and run the worst thing in the world is when the other colored shirt ends up catching the ball that guy doesnt make his living throwing the ball but it would be a nice option for us to have going forward
2810673 the only way they can get their jobs done is to collaborate via a virtual office and to get the information via ako
2810674 we already have video blogging and threaded discussions and we are going to add other features like wikis

2810678 amu is a heart wrenching story it is an important film and is very relevant to our times
2810679 we are very pleased that the film can be viewed on dvd and we thank excel for making it possible the cuts made in amu for television by the censors were equivalent to banning the film the indian government is not shielding indian youth from scenes of horrific violence because there are none in amu with the dvd format we hope the film reaches out to a larger audience without loosing crucial scenes
2810680 such a history cannot be buried and forgotten young people cannot make their future or understand their present without knowing the past today twenty four years after an elected government massacred its own people in full view of the world no one has been punished and as a result the cycle of violence has continued what kind of political system is this in which those in power can get away with such crimes again and again this is the question amu leaves the young protagonists with as they walk down a railway track into the future this is why we made amu so that people all over the world will ask the question
2810681 the dvd is a great way of keeping the message alive the movie deserves a wider audience since it will not release on television
2810682 we have made the dvd true to the essence of the film with deleted scenes theatrical trailers making of amu directors commentary recounting the numerous obstacles encountered during the making of the film the dvd also has stalwarts and actors from the industry including aamir khan shyam benegal mira nair naseeruddin shah jaya bachchan hema malini ketan mehta gulzar aparna sen vishal bharadwaj vivek oberoi shaad ali and others publicly endorsing the film
2810683 with such changes the film is meaningless as a result we will not be showing the film on indian television thus losing a significant audience which we hope to make up with the dvd
2810684 aside from market conditions which did not offer barcelona a clear opportunity to sign one of the few strikers with the capacity to compete with etoo his performance in the pre season cannot be underestimated

2810728 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2810729 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2810730 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2810731 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2810732 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles
2810733 the notion that compared with their large and mid cap counterparts small cap active equity managers are more likely to outperform their market segment

2810811 belinda i dont know what you were talking about goofy wolfed his supper as soon as i arrived and has dragged me round the entire neighbourhood

2810813 the whole process of making music has changed the very concept of composition now extends to the creation of sounds and textures im very curious to see how other people will use and manipulate my sounds and how they will use them as tools to create new music
2810814 i like the idea of giving people the opportunity to hear what i hear when im producing a separate candombl percussion track or some painstakingly constructed soundscape if mixing is part of the compositional process its only natural that i try sharing the compositional responsibilities with anyone interested in taking them on
2810815 this is what every intelligent musician should do the idea is to share and allow ones work to be cut up reinvented and who knows transformed into something even better than the original this isnt about generosity its about inventing new ways of creating musical products that go well beyond the world of physical carriers like vinyl and cds

2810824 speedo on mugavam nii vees kui kuival kuna arena toodang saabus alles paar p eva enne starti polnud iget v imalust seda proovidagi aga nelja aasta t htsaim v istlus pole kindlasti katsetamise koht
2810825 ujusin normi speedoga isikliku rekordi samuti olen terve suve speedos harjutanud ta sobib paremini tunnen end mugavamalt proovisin arenat aga ei saanud jalgu kuidagi liikuma peaks olema ainult sportlase asi mis ta endale selga paneb
2810826 aga siin eelistasin arenat speedole v rdlemisi kindlalt n d pean lihtsalt vaatama kuidas tehnika k ige viimane s na enda tehnikaga klappima saada
2810827 ootan mis t nu peatreener meijel a v n d tleb ehk ei juhtu midagi aga ta tegelikult juba palus et ma 100 vabalt arenas ujuksin vaatame
2810828 olen valmis alla kirjutama et arena j i kaks kolm n dalat hiljaks see on fakt hilinemises ei saa s distada ujujaid ega ujumisliitu m istan sportlasi konflikt vajab lahendamist ja nemad ei tohi kannatada
2810829 triin on a normi t itja tema peab saama ise otsustada kui palju kuluvad minu n rvid pole oluline
2810830 v tmek simus on kas meil on sponsoreid vaja v i ei ole enamik koondislasi on j udnud ol mpiale just arenaga n d siin on m nel kolm trikood k es ja nad ei tea mida valida kki polegi arenat piisavalt proovitud kki suhtutakse olukorda eelarvamusega
2810831 r gin arena inimestega iga p ev nad on m istlikud igal hommikul kell pool heksa jooksen ja saan vajadusel trikoosid vahetada loomulikult on meil lepingus teatud punktid ja trahvid aga sellest oleks praegu v ga ennatlik r kida m ni saab siin viis p eva rahulikult valmistuda ja ujub v ib olla arenaga v gevalt ootame kuni supp on jahtunud
2810832 siin ei ole teemat ei tasu otsida intriigi loomulikult on meil inimesi v he aga v he on olnud ka eelmistel ol mpiatel me ei j ua k ikjale oleme ka varem teistelt abi palunud

2810834 s udmise v istluspaigas t rkas minus endise spordiajakirjanikuna solidaarsus kui n gin et konksi peab heaegselt kaamerat ja mikrofoni hoidma kuigi kaameramehed on karastunud ja see polnud ilmselt esimene sellelaadne kogemus on ol mpiam ngud ikkagi tase kus kvaliteedile ei tohiks l ivu maksta
2810835 etv on v tnud ol mpia p hjalikult ette ilmselt napib siiski j udu eriti suvem ngudel kui heaegselt v istleb mitu sportlast nelja aasta p rast tuleks tiimi praeguselt 16 inimeselt oluliselt suurendada v i rollijaotus mber m ngida
2810836 kohtunik lasi m ngu k est ra jagades asjatuid kaarte peaasi oli aga kolm punkti mis ei tulnud kergelt n mme on ebamugav vastane
2810837 l pus l id nad ette pikki palle ja valmistasid meile probleeme
2810838 esimese kollase puhul vastane simuleeris ja teises olukorras p rkasin lihtsalt inertsist kaasiga kokku

2810844 kuulsin ainult karjumist pikka karjumist alguses arvasin juba et keegi h ppas tornist alla aga siis inimene ei karjuks nii pikalt
2810845 olin eile kohvikus kell oli 12 15 kui j rsku kuulsin karjumist arvasin et keegi h ppas tornist alla aga siis ei saaks inimene nii pikalt karjuda
2810846 karjeid oli mitu kui j udsin t navale jooksid inimesed tornist v lja k ik olid segaduses

2810851 hiinlased on v ga umbusklikud nende tagasimeelitamiseks tornide juurde kulub palju aega

2810986 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget

2810997 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject

2811000 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
2811001 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
2811002 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation
2811003 ignited has a grasp of the nuts and bolts of politics which i envy reading his pieces always make me view my own stuff as a bit conceptual and airy fairy a blog which is in touch with the unionist grass roots
2811004 fair deal is one of the very few bloggers delivering a dup standpoint in a thoughtful manner i rarely agree with what he says but hes always worth reading damian oloan is an excellent new addition writing coherent and temperate analysis from a liberal nationalist perspective an encouraging indication that moderation is not dead
2811005 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here
2811006 almost intimidating erudition from brian crowe as he examines the world from communitarian conservative perspective

2811015 i have asked that they produce an ad hoc report clarifying its assessment of the completion of the transformation of pira as set out in its 18th report
2811016 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
2811017 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
2811018 the use of the word theory can mislead those not familiar with science
2811019 this is due to an increased disillusionment with current sinn fein strategy i no longer share the belief that this strategy will lead to irish unification it is not just solely about policing i am disillusioned with the current political strategy
2811020 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
2811021 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
2811022 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
2811023 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
2811024 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
2811025 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
2811026 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him
2811027 depth variety and regular posts and a bit of politics too
2811028 a brilliant mix of humour politics and insightful analysis not just of ni but of british left politics and beyond where else do you get postings in what i assume is serbo croat beside gail walker watch and the photos attaching to the stories are usually hilarious although a disappointing absence of girls aloud as naughty schoolgirls of late
2811029 for its unusual socialist outlook on northern ireland and wider politics his is the perspective of someone who feels not unreasonably that the present party political system leaves his left wing views unrepresented as such he stands aside from the traditional ni partisan discussions a refreshing interesting and nicely written blog
2811030 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations
2811031 chekov really has a penchant for writing in a way that really grasps the reader
2811032 i hate to say it but chekov does write well
2811033 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject

2811061 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2811062 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2811063 it makes things run faster and smoother and gives us judges more confidence that people know whats going on
2811064 the difference in the system now is so huge i honestly have trouble going back to what it was like and i dont want to
2811065 research has shown that after a half an hour mental fatigue sets in and you start to lose proficiency
2811066 its a constitutional right for anyone facing loss of liberty
2811067 they have a right to understand the charges and what the process is
2811068 it only works if everyone in the system knows whats going on if they dont its not due process and its not fair

2811073 if we wanted grass we would take a street car and go out to lake phalen for a picnic
2811074 we were simply marooned in our house i can remember watching the canoes go by it was an adventure but what a mess when the water went back down
2811075 and ben mintzs shoe store lavonna meats had big salamis hanging from the ceiling and schmaltz herring i used to go there to buy the jewish paper the forward for my father two cents
2811076 that place was a pool hall long before it became a church
2811077 the port authority stole it from the people who lived there
2811078 no one wanted to move out we were made to move out the day my home was demolished i just sat in my car and cried that was my home
2811079 when the city said move out we just moved out we should have demonstrated we should have protested
2811080 the money made available for relocation was an insult but the biggest insult was th
2811081 my family moved up to dunedin terrace the street right on the bluff
2811082 we had a good view of the st paul airport and one time we watched a man jump out of a plane over the field his chute didnt fully open and he plopped down in the swamps around the field we ran out to help him and he was sitting there with his leg broken asking us for a cigarette
2811083 theres where the barn was for the fire horses a lot of peddlers lived on this street and they all had horses this place was loaded with horses
2811084 peddling became more difficult and the automobile traffic increasingly impossible to contend with it became too much for his horse and too much for him he was too old and too frightened to learn to drive a truck with a horse one could roll a cigarette with two fingers take a little nap and even read a paper but not with a mechanical contraption which had no sense or initiative of its own
2811085 there it stood behind them the big empty house wherein forever would be left the best of their lives
2811086 zelda didnt want furs or diamonds or big trips to anyplace exotic says her daughter pat kaplan

2811098 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2811099 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2811100 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2811101 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2811102 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2811103 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2811104 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2811105 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2811106 memang agak berat untuk putaran ii karena saya mendapatkan informasi bahwa pdip dan golkar akan mengalihkan dukungan ke kaji
2811107 pkb sudah jelas karena kalau saya lihat pkb nya gus dur maupun muhaimin nggak ke syaiful dari sejak awal karena kan nggak sejalan jadi memang tidak mudah untuk putaran ii ini untuk karsa
2811108 kalau pdip dan golkar dukung kaji itu sangat berat tapi justru itu yang membuat saya terusik untuk mensukseskan karsa yang dalam posisi relatif lemah untuk putaran ii ini kemarin saya baru dari jatim saya kumpulkan kader kader partai untuk mulai bekerja keras cerdas dan ikhlas untuk kemenangan karsa ini karena untuk menguji jaringan mesin partai dan kader partai dalam menghadapi pemilu 2009 di sinilah pemanasan untuk menuju kemenangan 2009 khususnya di jatim
2811109 para artis akan kami tes agar terjun di masyarakat untuk memenangkan pilkada jatim ini mereka diantaranya ada wulan guritno marini zumarnis eko patrio dan juga cahyono harapannya public figure ini bisa mengubah orang yang sebelumnya pemilih pak soetjipto atau pak soenarjo atau pak achmady bisa beralih memilih karsa

2811114 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio

2811116 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado

2811118 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados

2811121 she really appreciated the fact that i didnt want to steal the limelight there
2811122 even when women are facing a breast cancer diagnosis they are still concerned about caring for everyone else especially the emotions of others
2811123 even telling someone i have breast cancer its well thought out
2811124 women are trying to protect older aging parents and younger children and even their spouses even during illness women are socialized to care about others
2811125 its a time they should be caring about themselves what decisions they should be making about breast cancer they shouldnt emotionally burn themselves out by caring for others emotions
2811126 we tell women to seek out other breast cancer survivors other women who understand to increase their resources

2811135 i have to make all the right judgments as far as my health as far as my ankle before i go out there on the football field
2811136 when i go out on that football field i want to be running 100 mph with no restrictions thats what i am trying to accomplish being on the sidelines getting healthy and going out and being explosive and jumping up in the air and catching ball
2811137 i probably could get out there but i want be to my normal self like i know i can and thats what i want to accomplish
2811138 why wouldnt everybody want that from me i think everyone would be a lot happier when i am 100 percent i know my quarterback would be i dont see why there is a problem

2811143 i am going to go out and do things that i am capable of doing when i get healthy i think everybody around here will have a lot of appreciation for that when i am on the football field when i am healthy

2811200 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator he was a creative genius i shall never forget how in the height of his career he still had time to work and lend his celebrity to those of us much younger and at that time who were totally unknown even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed

2811202 i was starting to swing the bat a little better the team is playing good
2811203 it was just a big disappointment for something like this to happen
2811204 yeah probably could be thats why im going back to tampa
2811205 there have been a lot of big hits hes had hitting in the three hole for us
2811206 one thing about carl he has a propensity to come through in those moments thats what ive seen thee last couple of years this guy gets big hits
2811207 we have the mechanics within what we have right now if we choose to do something else we can do that also
2811208 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2811209 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2811210 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that

2811260 it makes sense to allow him to have some contact with his wife and to stay interacted in his family and feel like hes being treated as a human being
2811261 he was a great lawyer and advocate for people who need an advocate primarily the poor people disadvantaged whod had a hard time in life
2811262 he was always prepared a person who did the best job he could on behalf of his client
2811263 he was a lawyer who couldve done a lot of things with his career and he chose to serve the public and try to help people who were less fortunate than himself
2811264 we know that maori have slightly higher fertility and replacement rates than non maori and pacific rates are even higher again so those children that we are going to rely on in the future are actually maori and pacific and new migrant children who are the very one in the under achieving tale and if we dont get that right if we dont make the investment were all going to pay that price
2811265 well im talking to them about politics and why they need to participate and the whole exercise is to encourage them to enroll get themselves on the roll and vote for whoever they want to vote for
2811266 due to the fact that there was no consulation in their process for that piece of land and that memorial hall then i think that they didnt meet their obligations to us as a hapu and kaitiaki of this area
2811267 they not only replied to our thing but did a karanga when they came on and they had this wonderful haka which threw us off guard when they replied to our welcome so there was all that sort of stuff going on
2811268 none of us wanted to leave in the first place thats the biggest hui for our people and to be a part of that movement so were all happy to go back and whoever represents our people are very happy our young people have been starved for the last four five years actually 2002 was the last time so theyre all pretty hungry

2811278 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
2811279 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
2811280 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo
2811281 if someone went to the russians and said ok kosovo for iran wed have a deal
2811282 weve placed ourselves in a position that globally we dont have the wherewithal to do anything

2811286 im happy to be back out there but im disappointed like everybody else on the team that c c got hurt
2811287 its been a long time i just want to get back out there and play im just real happy its what i love doing its about time

2811290 were it possible for us to see further than our knowledge reaches perhaps we would endure our sadnessess with greater confidence than our joys for they are moments when something new has entered into us something unknown
2811291 when you hear a weekday anchor announce we have jesse ventura standing by to tell us what the next president needs to do to get the countrys economic house in order its clear youre not watching cnbcs
2811292 and when the markets are open you find yourself shaking your head at some of the programming
2811293 a regular segment called minyanville has that media companys co founder todd harrison sitting in front of the companys cartoon bear logo hoofy and boo by name offering supposedly lighthearted perspectives on the economy
2811294 looking at those pieces today is instructive because of how much emphasis the magazine like the rest of the media has historically put on investment performance when evaluating and feting favorite analysts
2811295 it mournfully explains whitneys insights havent always translated into lucrative investment picks and notes that her stock picking ranked 1 205th out of 1 919 equity analysts last year and 919th out of 1 917 through the first half of 2008
2811296 we dont disagree with fortunes contention that evaluating whitney on her stock picking record misses the point
2811297 with its celebration of whitney fortune perhaps without even realizing it seems to be inching over to this camp
2811298 i got into dilley a little there at the end but it was just last lap racing
2811299 it wasnt an easy week for me health wise but its great to get back to victory lane
2811300 the crew and everybody involved with the team had a part in this one
2811301 he tagged me pretty good and it was enough to make me lift off the throttle a little
2811302 i was a little tight there at the end but its every man for himself at that point i guess

2811307 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2811308 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
2811309 im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
2811310 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
2811311 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2811312 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2811313 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2811314 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2811315 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2811316 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts
2811317 the ball comes out hard and fast and straight and long so thats always good
2811318 its been a whirlwind for him and theres a lot of new information going in were progressing quickly

2811325 a new precedent for a potentially explosive series of other pro russian areas of the caucusus to declare independence such as transdniestr from moldova or south ossetia and abkhazia from georgia
2811326 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2811327 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2811328 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty
2811329 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2811330 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
2811331 manchmal m ssen sich solche anf hrer fragen wie n tzlich sie f r ihr volk noch sind

2811334 has already caused a great number of innocent victims and forced a great number of civilians to leave their homes
2811335 refrain also in the name of the common christian heritage from further confrontations and violent retaliations that could degenerate into a wider conflict
2811336 make every effort to support and promote initiatives aimed at reaching a peaceful and lasting solution in favor of an open and respectful coexistence
2811337 there is an immense battle going on in tolkiens world and it is taking place at different levels
2811338 i believe that there is an immense battle going on here in portishead indeed all through the gordano valley
2811339 i believe that there are spiritual forces of wickedness that are fighting against the coming of christs kingdom in this place
2811340 they are intent on breaking and destroying all that is good and lovely and true
2811341 pray for the overthrowing of darkness and for the breaking in of christs just and gentle rule
2811342 weve left portishead earlier than we would have done and the wickedness is one of the factors which made me leave the town
2811343 wed been in the town for 12 years and felt that our work here had come to an end
2811344 this was a message of farewell to the church family and not aimed at anyone individual
2811345 i want people to be aware that in this world there is a battle and not to lose heart whatever the struggles are and that good will overcome evil
2811346 this is a message of concern and love for the people that we loved in portishead to urge them to stand up for what is good lovely and true
2811347 i want to encourage gods people in portishead to stand for and do what is good and lovely and true and to push back evil
2811348 there is always a struggle between good and evil and the christian church shines as a bright beacon in this world which is often dark
2811349 portishead is no different from any other town in this regard there are a lot of good people in portishead working to service the community and their neighbours
2811350 portishead is a fine town with many fine people and is served faithfully by an active and attractive church
2811351 i consulted a lot of friends ive done a lot of discernment spoken with a lot of women friends i felt in conscience this matter of conscience keeps coming up and i dont know what other word to use if i didnt attend her ordination i would have to stop addressing this issue as i do
2811352 i would have a problem sleeping at night in the future if i didnt put my body where my words are
2811353 i dont know how i could continue to be silent in the church this is such a big issue for me
2811354 over the years and listening to women friends if one listens just shuts up and listens to their stories their faith journey and in some cases their call by god to ordination to the priesthood in the catholic church there is a problem for us guys in the church what are we saying god is calling us but not you this is heresy were tampering with the sacred here
2811355 we cannot justify discrimination no matter how hard the bishops may try in the end it is wrong it is a sin thats how i see it and thats why i am going to be there saturday
2811356 we profess that god is all powerful and the source of life yet when it comes to women being ordained it seems that opponents are saying that this same god somehow can not empower a woman to be a priest suddenly we as men believe god becomes powerless when women approach the altar to celebrate mass
2811357 weve contacted all his friends and family at this point that we know of
2811358 i see theyve got the hoary old beat up on single parents
2811359 ive got one view on that whatever we do with single parents we have got to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children and its not always in the best interest of every child that mum is at work all day
2811360 and the truth is most people on the dpb are not there for very long
2811361 im all in favour of supporting single parents to get into work but in the final analysis we have to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children in a particular family
2811362 theyve got a lot of things going on in their lives and to tell a single parent they have a work obligation can be too tough
2811363 unfortunately when we arrived on the scene there was nothing we could do
2811364 sarah was one of lifes great enthusiasts she was so excited about this trip she was so full of life
2811365 we dont regret her going but obviously we regret that this accident happened just two weeks into her trip
2811366 with the emergence of a rising middle class in developing markets and subsequent need for retirement planning we believe our partnership with cimb group will enable us to address key markets for both conventional and shariah compliant products and services particularly in southeast asia and the middle east
2811367 i knew i shoulda made dat lef toin at albacoikey
2811368 i disagree therefore it doesnt reflect well on the body
2811369 your critics are your best friends they havent given up on you
2811370 we can say its just humour and its actually kind of creative but thats a good conversation to have for anything other than a group professing to represent jesus christ

2811396 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2811397 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2811544 to fulfil his ambitions he bjp leader l k advani has made at least three attempts to topple our government but on each occasion his astrologers have misled him at his ripe old age i do not expect shri advani to change his thinking but for his sake and indias sake i urge him at least to change his astrologers so that he gets more accurate predictions of things to come
2811545 when politicians shout down each other at the slightest provocation there is little scope for humour
2811546 in fact once advani had admitted that if something is missing from his personality it is a sense of humour

2811554 identify evidence that saddam had committed a material breach of his obligations under the existing un resolution 1441
2811555 i think no one would be surprised at the idea that the use of spy planes to review what is going on would be considered what is surprising is the idea that they would be used painted in the colours of the united nations in order to provoke an attack which could then be used to justify material breach now that plainly looks as if it is deception and it raises some fundamental questions of legality both in terms of domestic law and international law
2811556 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2811557 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2811558 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2811559 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2811560 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2811561 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
2811562 out of unity comes security i dont think you can impose security from on top just look at yugoslavia for years it seemed as if everything was quiescent so i think we want to put unity first out of real unity which can only be based on understanding and mutual respect will come the kind of security that we really want and the people really want

2811637 when i got into the workshop of wicked i thought i should have some kind of product to promote when im at the theater so i made another album with six songs and i funded it myself its called here and id sell it at the theater and id sell about 100 albums a week
2811638 it allows me to be real intimate with the microphone and show lower registers that you dont use in the theater because they dont project as much
2811639 it picks up on the complexities in my voice in different ways in the theater its all about being very impressive and showing your range i didnt want to alienate the theater fans i wanted them to buy my album and not do a complete about face
2811640 i think it was that they were looking for real fresh raw unique young people
2811641 at that time i had studied at nyu and majored in theater but i was singing in rock bands all over the village so i was sort of a hybrid i was very much in touch with how to break the rules and how to find what makes you different
2811642 i try to parallel the singing voice to my speaking voice a lot because i feel if it comes from the place where you talk thats what will give people the goose bumps
2811643 i think we were attracted to each other went to have lunch felt we had nothing in common and didnt really care about each other that much
2811644 as the journey of rent went on taye and i became really close and became really good friends
2811645 it was sort of one of those nights where we went and saw a movie and had dinner together and found ourselves kissing each other
2811646 i got dropped from hollywood records and i couldnt get arrested i took a dive for a little while there i have to say
2811647 it felt like it was going to be a special experience from the beginning i didnt know to what extent and how phenomenal it would become it wasnt until we put it up in san francisco that i started to feel a sense of magic in the audience and that thing that i felt when we were doing rent where it starts to take hold of itself and start to produce its own energy
2811648 i actually have rearranged it in a way that feels very consistent with what im doing right now
2811649 the song and the role changed my life its such an honor to get up there and the reaction people singing along thats what you live for as a performer to be associated with such an iconic song
2811650 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field

2811653 shelby county sheriffs deputies received a 911 call about 1 00 pm 1800 gmt central time from family members they had gone out at about noon today to a grocery store and came back and unfortunately found him unresponsive in the bedroom
2811654 family members believe at this point it is a medical condition that might have led to his death
2811655 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury
2811656 but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2811657 im going to do everything i can to step up to any problems that are going to face the country but again i look forward to doing other things you know next year
2811658 i believe it is going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all of the housing problems
2811659 were going to continue to have turmoil in our capital markets
2811660 the long term economic fundamentals of the united states compare very favorably
2811661 well we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2811662 i think it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are important to our capital markets broadly
2811663 my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2811664 we have a regulatory system that is very outdated it was put in place many years ago
2811665 i am a huge admirer of vedran he is a top class player with a bright future ahead of him and i am delighted that he continues to be a part of our plans at manchester city
2811666 were now into our fourth day and were very concerned
2811667 theres short term goals and theres long term goals like playing for the all blacks
2811668 i want to become a dominant no 13 outside centre and be considered one of the best centres going around in world rugby and i want to play for the all blacks one day
2811669 but first i just want to play good footy i want to win the competition with toulon and repay the faith that coach tana umaga has shown in me by getting out there and helping this team
2811670 its a new game and a new challenge and i know ive got a lot to learn but im excited to be learning off one of the all time greats in tana umaga
2811671 i think if i am as committed as i was to playing rugby league and learning the game then the next two years will work out
2811672 i think probably a forward going into the forwards would be a lot more difficult because theres a lot of things that are different
2811673 in the backs its still hard because of all the technical things its not as easy as people think
2811674 ive written down all the plays and that the plays are pretty simple
2811675 brokaw repeatedly splashes paulson in the face with reality on this mornings meet the press tells him the stimulus checks that his treasury sent out

2811684 you are rideing the most biggest gratest most largest farris wheel in the world
2811685 i went out on my back deck and was just standing there thinking about life contemplating the hows and whys of it as i stood there looking towards the west as the sun began to get low in the sky something caught my eye floating down from the sky as it got closer i could see exactly what it was as it slowly floated above me i watched in anticipation as to where it might land i knew it was going to land right there on the deck and it did i went over to it and picked it up a perfect white feather the down along the sides was soft and delicate my first thought was about angels and that one of the signs is finding white feather nearby i carefully placed the feather on the handrail on the deck and i looked at it for a long time i then looked up at the sky the evening rays of the sun was shining through the clouds like prisms and the clouds themselves were alive with color id like to think that there was a angel near me as i stood out on the deck as i was thinking about the past the feather is safely kept as a reminder of gods love for me and that he and his heavenly hosts are never far they are always with me

2811696 da vile nascondere ci che si crede liddio di mia madre ora il mio dio ieri sera ero sveglio e allimprovviso vidi la faccia di mia madre davanti a me sentii che dovevo trovare il suo salvatore il mio salvatore per rifugiarmi in lui e allora pregai come il brigante in croce supplicai cristo di perdonarmi di purificare lanima mia peccatrice di prepararmi per presentarmi a lui poich lo dovevo incontrare cos presto fu una notte strana in certi momenti mi sembrava che intorno a me tutto fosse luce versetti della bibbia e dellinnario della mia cara madre mi tornavano in mente e mi portavano dei messaggi del salvatore lo accettai resi grazie e da allora questa strofa risuona senza tregua in me la risposta di dio alla mia preghiera non posso pi tener la cosa celata poich fra poche ore sar col signore io peccatore salvato per grazia
2811697 koskino hai ragione oh se soltanto sapessi che v ancora misericordia per me ma le mie mani han versato il sangue la mia lingua ha bestemmiato dio i miei piedi han calpestato tutto ci che sacro so che c un inferno ed lunico posto dove io possa andare

2811711 were looking back and we see theyre gaining on us
2811712 tech in 2008 story yes mccains two most recent ads
2811713 dear christie perusing the g amp m i found your article on the opening ceremony in beijing
2811714 you make a good point to remind audiences it is an entertaining show in a dictatorship nevertheless i was disappointed in the whole by your article for the following reasons
2811715 one reason is a question of style as you refer to your friends quite often it is a dangerous game to do this because it either reveals youre well connected or that your friends are more interesting than you are
2811716 so i think you may have lost some power in your writing by deferring to others
2811717 most importantly however is that you spent a lot of room putting down the chinese government and very little on understanding the meaning of the ceremonys themes
2811718 the idea china is opening to the world and slowly thawing towards freedom doesnt come up in your view of the ceremony even though that was their clear focus a gigantic dove was shown in the stadium how many dictatorships do you know that tell their citizens peace is praiseworthy
2811719 after all even in the wake of muslim terrorism in northern china the chinese government didnt impose martial law there whereas canada imposed the war measures act for a much more limited terrorist event in quebec a few decades ago
2811720 statements you make or quote such that empires are based on freedom are simply incorrect
2811721 surely you know the entertainers in the empires form of olympics were slaves slated to die
2811722 the bare chesting and spitting ban may seem ridiculous to you
2811723 lets look at ourselves walking around canadian cities i find spitting by young canadian males is quite popular yet it is unhygienic and disrespectful towards fellow citizens and their own urban environment
2811724 spitting is one of the oldest forms of aggression in the animal kingdom to which we belong
2811725 freedom in my educated opinion is an idea that has lost its meaning in articles such as yours because it lacks the all important ingredients of knowledge and responsibility
2811726 so in balance one could judge your article with the same yardstick you judged the chinese opening ceremony and come out with the same conclusion a show in your case of misplaced political correctness and of a good measure of historical ignorance

2811784 georgia seeks peaceful resolution to the conflict in south ossetia georgian troops mobilize to protect civilian population from rebel attacks tbilisi sat 09 august 2008 the government of georgia has sought to defuse the tense and violent situation in the south ossetia region yesterday by declaring a unilateral ceasefire and appealing to the leadership of the separatist rebels to begin talks with the state minister for reintegration temuri yakobashvili despite calls for peace separatist rebels continued to attack georgian police posts and the civilian population initially government forces did not return fire however at 8 30pm the village of avnevi came under fire from separatists and the village was almost completely destroyed the government controlled village of prisi also came under attack by separatists which left several people wounded in response to separatist attacks on government controlled villages georgian armed forces occupied several villages in south ossetia early this morning at around 5 30am russian federation forces began moving into the conflict zone through the roki tunnel which connects russia and georgia and has been an entry point for the illegal transfer and sale of arms to separatist rebels two additional russian units entered into georgia through the roki tunnel around 8 00am the first russian unit that entered georgia through the roki tunnel was killed as they attempted to cross the gufta bridge which was also destroyed in the operation conducted by the governments air command the russian air force has also been conducting military operations in georgia military fighter planes dropped bombs in four towns the russian air force also bombed the villages of variani injuring seven civilians and dropped three bombs on gori the osce has confirmed the gori operation was conducted by the russian air force so far several people have been killed and wounded including innocent civilians in an effort to protect the civilian population the president of georgia mikhail saakashvili declared a unilateral ceasefire to be in effective between 3 00pm 6 00pm friday during this time the civilian population and the separatists were invited to cross the line of control the government has also provided humanitarian assistance and full amnesty for those separatists that choose to surrender as of 2 30pm georgian forces controlled 100 of tskhinvali with just a few small groups still resisting government presence despite the ceasefire russia continued to take aggressive military action within georgian territory at 4 30pm and 5 35pm russian military aircraft bombed a georgian military base in marneuli three times in the southern part of the country about 30 kilometres from tbilisi resulting in the destruction of grounded georgian military equipment severe damage to a number of buildings and several causalities russian military aircraft also entered georgian airspace at 3 05pm and dropped two bombs on the georgian military airbase in vaziani just on the outskirts of the capital

2811848 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2811849 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2811850 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2811851 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2811852 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2811853 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2811854 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2811855 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2811856 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2811857 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2811858 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2811859 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2811860 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2811861 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2811862 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2811863 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2811864 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2811865 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2811866 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2811867 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2811868 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2811869 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2811870 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2811871 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2811872 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2811873 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2811874 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2811875 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2811876 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2811877 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2811878 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2811879 georgia does not stop its treacherous actions on abkhazias border and continues to intensify its military presence the armed forces of the republic were forced to enter the security zone and advance towards the georgian border

2811897 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2811898 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2811899 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2811900 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2811901 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2811902 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2811903 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2811904 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2811905 who are open to doing something on the production side
2811906 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2811907 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2811908 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2811909 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2811910 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2811911 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2811912 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2811913 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2811914 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2811915 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2811916 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2811917 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2811918 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2811919 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2811920 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2811921 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2811922 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2811923 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2811924 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2811925 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2811926 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2811927 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2811928 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2811929 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2811930 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2811931 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2811932 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2811933 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2811934 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2811935 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2811936 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2811937 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2811938 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2811939 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2811940 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2811941 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2811942 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2811943 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2811944 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2811945 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2811946 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2811947 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2811948 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2811995 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2811996 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2811997 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2811998 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2811999 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2812000 recupera o do chalet da condessa de edla 1 fase
2812001 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2812002 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2812003 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2812011 i wasnt sure what to expect because chico is quite inexperienced
2812012 but i think he did very well he only did his first three star at the end of last season and a score of 50 00 is not bad at all its not so long ago that we were earning marks of 70 so im actually very pleased and im hugely proud to be here there is no better feeling
2812013 he was tense at the start but its hard to know what was bothering him
2812014 and well see what happens on monday in cross country
2812015 normally hes a show off and i was hoping the lights and crowd would help him to bring out his best and they did
2812016 he fell over but got up again and we didnt think there was much wrong with him but later in the day he began to go lame and today it was much worse
2812017 he just wasnt right we think perhaps he has injured his stifle or it could be a tendon but as yet we are not certain
2812018 on behalf of the whole sport i would like to extend our deepest sympathy to emmas family the thoughts and prayers of eventing people all over the uk are with them at this sad time
2812019 he can be a very spooky horse but he is always wanting to try for me
2812020 it was quite electric but very silent at the same time
2812021 there was hardly a sound and yet i was very conscious of the cameras clicking and the birds singing it felt a bit strange
2812022 but he extended well in trot and that brightened him up a bit he is still very young and has to mature physically and i see him as my horse for the olympics in london
2812023 mandiba is the friendly tribal name given to nelson mandela
2812024 my horse has done all the questions i think he will be fine
2812025 he went well in chatsworth and was fifth at the world cup event in tattersalls in ireland but hes never been in an electric arena like this
2812026 he felt quite bright and had a look at the flowers if he had been a bit softer we would have had better marks but overall i am pleased
2812027 this is my first real team experience and im really enjoying it weve got a great team
2812028 when i got this horse first i could hardly persuade him to go from the barn to the arena because he was so difficult so its a dream to be here with him at the olympic games
2812029 the options will be very time consuming so i have made a plan how to go although i know i must be flexible but i came to go out there and mean it
2812030 we really worked on the test and it was our best ever
2812031 it will be a bit like an eight minute jump off
2812032 there is no time to recover if something goes wrong so you need to give it 150 concentration but the german team position has improved its really looking good and we are feeling very confident
2812033 i didnt quite have him how i would like it but if we end up on that score that that would be ok
2812034 he blew up going into the arena he felt like he just wanted to explode so i thought well i can either kick him forward and tell him to get on with it or just give up altogether and accept that its going to be a disaster
2812035 my horse was nearly too quiet but he is very sensible and i was pleased with him
2812036 the more i walk it the more manageable it seems
2812037 the aussies and germans have to go clear to stay ahead of us our horses are well prepared we have a great group of riders and we are on a mission
2812038 horsemanship will count for a great deal cross country time will be an important factor and i hope the officials have the confidence to use the full extent of the track without dropping any of the loops
2812039 the biggest course the world has ever seen although it will be bigger than athens
2812040 i think theres an unusual split in the group we havent seen in the past
2812041 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man
2812042 a lot of that has to do with how hes wanted this job so bad for so long that hes tied himself to president bush
2812043 as an organisation with the primary mission of protecting the health and welfare of the horse the aaep is strongly opposed to soring
2812044 this wonderful breed must be preserved and protected in a climate in which its future is not challenged by the practice of soring the true measure of success will be that soring no longer exists because the tennessee walking horse industry itself brought it to an abrupt end
2812045 the white paper is not intended to be a revision of the horse protection act
2812046 we know we are suggesting radical changes to current practices within the industry but if industry leaders are intent on solving this issue they will give serious thought to the recommendations that have been made
2812047 on behalf of the aaep i express gratitude to dr leitch who chaired the task force and the other dedicated aaep members who accepted the charge of this task force and were so thoughtful in the development of the white paper

2812071 lebanon is preparing itself for the iya2009 and a number of activities are scheduled for that purpose
2812072 the aim of the year is to stimulate worldwide interest especially among young people in astronomy and science under the central theme
2812073 iya2009 events and activities will promote a greater appreciation of the inspirational aspects of astronomy that embody an invaluable shared resource for all nations
2812074 we are not aware of that and i think we probably would be if it were true
2812075 even if the pipe is out of action for a week or two weeks its very unlikely that this would have much effect on global oil supplies
2812076 the task of the russian forces at present is to ensure control of south ossetia the pipelines would be in danger only if the war escalated
2812077 if russia started an economic blockade then it might target the pipelines
2812078 attempts to take control of that pipeline would be extreme
2812079 the conflict is going to cause people to think twice about investing in the oil industry in the caspian region if its in the middle of a war zone
2812080 this decision on wednesday by the security cabinet represents a change in israeli policy after always firmly separating hizbullah and the lebanese government
2812081 as responsible for any event that takes place in its sovereign territory or events for which lebanese nationals are responsible
2812082 in the coming weeks israel plans to start transmitting this message to the united nations united states russia and european nations and primarily to syria and hizbullah itself
2812083 the us claimed that bombing lebanese infrastructure would topple the moderate siniora government
2812084 the first is the fact hizbullah is now a partner in a lebanese unity government and holds veto rights
2812085 the second is that the policy statement of the new lebanese government approved by president michel sleiman allows hizbullah to continue its military activity against israel
2812086 believes these new conditions improve israels deterrent power as hizbullah understands the severe ramifications of the new situation should there be any action against israel in lebanon or overseas
2812087 should respect the laws and policies of their host countries and know that the fight against israel should take place in lebanon and not anywhere else
2812088 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations
2812089 we expect that a resolution calling for an immediate cease fire will be introduced shortly
2812090 to take urgent action calling for an immediate cease fire and withdrawal of all forces to the status quo
2812091 actually impeding the withdrawal of georgian forces from south ossetia
2812092 this is an unconscionable effort to continue the conflict and prevent the georgians from taking concrete steps to de escalate the situation
2812093 we condemn the russian attack on the sovereign of georgia
2812094 targeting of civilians and campaign of terror as well as its destruction of in georgias infrastructure
2812095 this is completely unacceptable especially from the lips of a representative of a country whose action we are aware of in iraq afghanistan and serbia
2812096 above all i think they have one moral duty to speak with a united voice and stop russian aggression
2812097 our citizens are dying and the last thing we want is to continue this game
2812098 all of these bombings are aimed at provoking panic georgia wants peace and nothing else
2812099 we had our troops in and relocated them out of the zone where they were stationed before after theyve completed the task of cleaning basically theyre out theyre out i can confirm
2812100 basically i think this is not about georgia anymore this is about basic values of humanity of american values that we always ourselves believed in this is all about future of the world order
2812101 i think the us is the most powerful country in the world i think the us has lots of leverage and i think there are lots of diplomatic means that this could be done through
2812102 following the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia the president of the republic believes there is a real perspective of rapidly finding a way out of the crisis
2812103 also expressed his concerns about the disproportionate use of force and lack of respect for the territorial integrity of georgia

2812110 once operative the mobile missiles will threaten the dominance of the israeli air force over lebanon
2812111 he was senior even to the defense minister he knew everything
2812112 if syria has passed russian made sa 8 mobile launchers to hizbullah the shiite group that came close to defeating the israeli army two years ago it is in possession of a potent weapon to defy israeli air power
2812113 crossing a red line supplying arms to hizbullah in lebanon
2812114 some 76 patriarchs have led the maronite christian community over the years
2812115 many believe sfeir to be one of the countrys most influential patriarchs as he defended both the principle of lebanese coexistence and non violence among communities
2812116 it is our duty to keep alive the ties of maronites around the world with their church and country
2812117 the lebanese are hard working and talented but they work in a very selfish manner
2812118 should the lebanese unite their forces and talent the outcome would be impressive
2812119 a curse but rather as a source for development and change toward the best
2812120 politics and politicians have set a bad example and its up for the lebanese to prove that they are able to unite for the welfare of their country
2812121 we felt it coming instinctively it was just a matter of time
2812122 we watch tv the georgian and russian channels and surf the net to try to untangle the truth from fiction and get an idea of what is happening in south ossetia
2812123 i would have preferred simply to return home but you cannot choose the circumstances it falls on us to defend our country
2812124 we have received the green light from tbilisi we do not yet know when and where we are going
2812125 when they call their families our soldiers do not speak too much of our plan we are afraid that the russians listen to our phones
2812126 i have two children and in the past 14 months that i have been in iraq i can see they have grown in the pictures my wife sent me
2812127 professionally speaking we have learned a lot knowing how to work and move together
2812128 this will serve against the russians even if the fight will be very different and even though i have no illusions of the power of the russian army
2812129 one knows that we cannot win against russia with its latest weaponry but we must go we fight for justice and democracy
2812130 we have not finished our mission in iraq but we must leave our american friends
2812131 in lebanon we have haut culture but not a young fresh attitude
2812132 it is a chance to launch ourselves in the fashion world in lebanon
2812133 syria has carried out what it promised in this regard
2812134 if after visiting the site the iaea wants any clarifications then syria can give answers to them
2812135 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2812136 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2812137 our negotiators have really found compromises on all these issues
2812138 you may hear many dates but i caution you not to take any of these dates until you get the final document
2812139 overall the picture is one of a still tight market with growing demand vulnerable to supply risks
2812140 upside risks remain we expect prices to range in a 110 130 band for the next 18 months while not ruling out investor driven price spikes
2812141 the world will experience a serious oil supply crunch within five to 10 years unless there is a collapse in oil demand
2812142 given recent price experience a spike in excess of 200 per barrel is not infeasible
2812143 we think that the recent sharp falls in commodity prices are more than just a temporary dip in an upward trend
2812144 commodity prices are now much higher and affordability more stretched than they were a year ago implying greater scope for further falls
2812145 the global demand environment is clearly much weaker the oecd organization for economic cooperation and development economies grew by just over three percent in 2006 but many are now flirting with outright recession
2812146 the solution to the problem rests solely with the mauritanians we are going to help them to reach an agreement
2812147 we want to prevent mauritania from falling into a vicious cycle where the crisis deepens and the international community is led to take measures that would be unfortunate for the lives and the future of the mauritanian people
2812148 joins other institutions in calling for the return of constitutional order
2812149 i telephoned abdallahi personally to explain to him the gravity of his decree and suggest he postpone it to avoid the worst
2812150 i explained to him how it could have serious consequences how it could lead to military engagements death and destruction and that it would be best to reconsider his decision but he was stubborn
2812151 it was our duty to remind him of his humanitarian responsibilities to try to dissuade him but he chose to ignore us just as in the same manner he tried to destroy the country and block its institutions
2812152 placing the emphasis not on enticing foreigners to like us more but on defeating an ideology
2812153 we want to break the linkages between groups like al qaeda and their target audiences
2812154 the fake veneer on the reputation of extremists and allow publics to see the shame and hostility of life in terrorism
2812155 the battle of ideas in the war on terror is a complex mixture
2812156 to undermine the wests support for moderate islamic regimes and to prevent its secular ways from corrupting islam
2812157 this war is a battle over religious dogma within islam
2812158 which would mobilize muslims against the west and thus lead to the purification of islamic society
2812159 many in the muslim world believe the war on terrorism is essentially a war on islam this view impedes the success of an effective foreign policy strategy
2812160 we must work quickly to rebuild the shattered foundations of understanding between the united states and predominantly muslim states and communities
2812161 engagement in the war of ideas during the cold war was so effective because the mission was clear and simple
2812162 ideological struggle with the soviets as part of a comprehensive strategy designed to challenge the very basis of soviet power
2812163 it is essentially impossible to wage an economic war against al qaeda and its affiliates or to pursue a military strategy of containment without at the same time harming muslim states and populations whom we do not want to harm
2812164 can unite a fragmented silent majority of muslims opposed to violent extremism and help it to find its voice in the face of thuggish opponents
2812165 the authoritarian governments of the middle east are doing their best to hobble
2812166 by blocking the internet they are leaving the field open to al qaeda and its recruiters
2812167 should include seeking and integrating input from legislative bodies universities think tanks and friends in the muslim world
2812168 exacting consequences when commitments are broken or agreements not implemented
2812169 i see theyve got the hoary old beat up on single parents
2812170 ive got one view on that whatever we do with single parents we have got to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children and its not always in the best interest of every child that mum is at work all day
2812171 and the truth is most people on the dpb are not there for very long
2812172 im all in favour of supporting single parents to get into work but in the final analysis we have to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children in a particular family
2812173 theyve got a lot of things going on in their lives and to tell a single parent they have a work obligation can be too tough
2812174 i did not hear ammars words in parliament berris voice was very loud while trying to restore order
2812175 parliament was closed for two years in the face of the parliamentary majority and now we are being prevented from expressing our opinion freely
2812176 parliament was closed in the face of an illegitimate government
2812177 we want to make a fresh start let us not push each other into speaking about past experiences
2812178 there will be no real settlement without finding a solution to this issue
2812179 we want to know whether they march 14 mps are voluntarily committed to the doha agreement or was the accord forced on them
2812180 the dispute in lebanon is one about the nature of the state this dispute cannot be solved through a national unity government or a ministerial statement
2812181 the right of lebanons people armed forces and resistance to liberate or reclaim the israeli occupied shebaa farms kafar shuba hills and the lebanese section of ghajar village and defend lebanon using all legal and possible means
2812182 i would rather wait and see how the discussions would develop
2812183 i wish i had the choice of singling out siniora when giving the government a vote of confidence
2812184 my arms are reaching out out across this canyon im asking you to be my true companion so dont you dare and try to walk away ive got my heart set on our wedding day ive got this vision of a girl in white made my decision that its you all right
2812185 while the lights of the city are shining below gonna hold on to you girl and never let go while everyone else is just walking around in their sleep baby lets dig down dig down deep i wanna dig down deep
2812186 dont you gimme no buick son you must take my word if theres a god in heaven hes got a silver thunderbird you can keep your eldorados and the foreign cars absurd me i wanna go down in a silver thunderbird
2812187 weve contacted all his friends and family at this point that we know of
2812188 un figlio che perde i genitori un orfano una moglie marito che perde il coniuge vedovo vedova chi perde un figlio cos
2812189 dimmi madre mia come hai fatto tu ai piedi della croce come hai fatto a vederlo morire e sopravvivere insegnami il segreto perch io torni a vivere per il discepolo che lui amava
2812190 when it comes to sport we will always remain friends if the world were to draw any lessons from what we do there wouldnt be any wars there should be no hatred between athletes and people in general well leave it to the politicians to figure it out
2812191 reflects the olympic spirit and the value of the games
2812192 for the olympics unfortunately this is not a big deal
2812193 when its individual against individual you probably wrestled against the guy before in the european championships or the world championships
2812194 you dont see him as a russian who invaded your country you see him as a guy who beat me 3 2 last time
2812195 its a nice idea but really it was safe passage
2812196 if a war was going on they would sop and let athletes and spectators go to olympia then they would fight again when the olympics finished they stopped again and let everyone leave here i think the russians mocked the whole thing
2812197 our athletes are nervous they are thinking about their families
2812198 but we are together with more passion and feeling maybe athletes can show somehow that you should be fighting only the sports arena we can show all of the world that we want peace
2812199 the mindless slaughter is being conducted by a russian military that seeks to reassert itself not only in the former soviet union but also to extend its reach throughout what used to be the former soviet union in an attempt to fold back into the russian empire those countries that have broken away from it most notably georgia
2812200 yeah they la rocha just sings with an edgy voice
2812201 were now into our fourth day and were very concerned
2812202 we are fighting a machine that has 500 million dollars even with that money both parties have come together to keep us off the ballot to white us out of the media
2812203 i know his grandmother lives in hawaii and i know hawaii is a state
2812204 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome

2812207 yeah thats me can you give me some free popcorn
2812208 i told you but you didnt want to believe it
2812209 the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light
2812210 sometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious
2812211 in a series of e mails i patiently explained that bush couldnt be hitler since hitler was dead

2812216 regelmatig krijgt justitie te maken met versleutelde harde schijven verdachten kunnen niet gedwongen worden om wachtwoorden af te geven waardoor ze vrijuit gaan als justitie er niet in slaagt de wachtwoorden te kraken met dit nieuwe systeem is het wachtwoord van een verdachte eenvoudig uit te lezen

2812219 i have to admit something sometimes i like to read the missed connections section in the paper just for fun and i really like them is that so bad
2812220 random house made its final decision based on the advice of other scholars conveniently not named in the article and based ultimately on its determination of corporate interests
2812221 a long history of anti islamic polemic that uses sex and violence to attack the prophet and his faith first pioneered in medieval christian writings
2812222 muhammad wanted to give women freedom but the other men took it away
2812223 can write about jesus but sherry jones cant write about muhammad or his wife
2812224 we would have to achieve a truce and we would have to deal with the same parties as before
2812225 stay there two years and destroy the hamas regime down to the last office and the last operative
2812226 you israel control another people against their will and the palestinian people when they compare the two will choose hamas and not those who talk
2812227 it is going to be a long day so i just have to stay patient
2812228 i am going to relax and get off my feet and get a little rub down
2812229 i am four behind at the moment and i would take that as long as there are not 20 guys between me and three under
2812230 as long as there are not too many bodies ahead of you you can make up quite a big amount in the last round of a major

2812421 the georgians have left already and we are expecting the russian side to come down the road soon we are operating normally nobody has disturbed us at all
2812422 they told us to come out i dont know why but some of our guys are still out there in the fields
2812423 i want to go back and to stay if we lose south ossetia now it wont be forever because we will never surrender our land
2812424 there is a lot of panic many people have left and i am thinking of joining them my bags are already packed
2812425 we are afraid that the russians will come here and kill us people would not go if we had a strong army but they dont believe in our army any more its a tragedy when a man loses his motherland then hes no longer even a man
2812426 i have left everything i dont even have another shirt if the russians stay then i can never return were afraid of what the russians can do
2812427 we are only waiting now to see what will happen russia could completely occupy georgia now and the west will not do anything to stop them because they are afraid to go against them

2812433 this is one of the most important things in our portfolio because if we are serious in cutting down on co2 emissions we need to exhaust our possibilities on how we can develop wind and photovoltaic but if we are serious about cutting emissions we have no other choice but to use nuclear
2812434 its pity to see that edf as a world player isnt taking this opportunity but this is not the end of the nuclear development its just the start
2812435 we have a number of tasks how we take care of the waste bring the whole site to how it was before how are we able to develop skills and talents in west cumbria and in the uk to take this success story and multiple it and implement it somewhere else in the world
2812436 the message has to be that as we want to develop nuclear skills we have a 40 year plan that engineering in nuclear is going to be wanted for the next 40 years graduates at present are getting a degree in nuclear decommissioning not nuclear development we need to have a second line in parallel to decommissioning to take us to the second level it may take us a decade or so it is not a matter of a couple of years
2812437 there has been at least a very clear message that the government is supporting the plans for nuclear this is a very important step and we shouldnt underestimate the importance of the commitment of a country to a plan
2812438 god did not give everyone oil and gas many countries would like to be sitting on some kind of resources but that isnt the case thats why you have unions and agreements but these things are very dynamic very fluid who would have thought that angola would be interesting for the us suddenly angola is supplying the us with oil which they didnt have before

2812460 darwin was fascinated by questions of hair colour and the role it might play in choosing sexual partners he was keen to test whether english blondes really were more likely to stay single with a resulting decrease in blonde hair in subsequent generations
2812461 there are nine sets of calculations in which darwin and his son george who was about to take up a fellowship at cambridge combined and reanalysed the data
2812462 your apology for troubling me in this matter really made me feel ashamed i think there can be but few of us humbler cultivators of natural science who would not feel it an honour to be permitted to contribute his stone towards the building of your great edifice
2812463 sadly so far none of darwins letters to beddoe have been found there are no fewer than nine sets of calculations in which darwin and his son george who was just about to take up a fellowship in cambridge combined and reanalysed the data
2812464 eventually darwin came to the conclusion that the experimental basis was not good enough both beddoe and darwin came to the conclusion that the original results were misleading and didnt make sufficient allowance for the darkening of hair with age
2812465 he had hundreds of correspondents from all over the world as well as manuscripts seed samples plants and even dung these letters give us an insight into darwin the scientist and also darwin the man and his family life
2812466 we have had to apply a lot of detective work into these letters as few of them are actually dated while some of the words he uses do not mean the same as they do now and there are a lot of abbreviations that read a bit like modern text messages
2812467 it has become almost a clich to remark that nobody boasts of ignorance of literature but it is socially acceptable to boast ignorance of science

2812725 javais cherch deux vers que je connaissais j tais absent de moi plut t nuage ind cis un passant pas tr s s r d tre vraiment quelquun je me souvenais du moment et de lendroit pr cis o javais lu ces vers et je pensais que c tait encore le voyage mon id e du voyage les r miniscences les chos qui vous surprennent et donnent du sens de simples anecdotes des bribes de textes que lon croyait enfouien dans le d sordre de la m moire et qui soudain ressurgissent intactes
2812726 were now into our fourth day and were very concerned
2812727 we amp squo re now into our fourth day and we amp squo re very concerned
2812728 i keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it
2812729 its just the solitude and the unspoiled wilderness that really really attracts me to this area and has kept me here for the better part of my life
2812730 if you were to squeeze it like a giant sponge you could cover the entire state of minnesota with a foot of water
2812731 the sphagnum moss will hold 28 times its volume in water so its like a huge sponge
2812732 its been said that if you were to squeeze it like a giant sponge you could cover the entire state of minnesota with a foot of water
2812733 look down in there and you can see this ones got a fly in it
2812734 most of what they eat are the flesh eating flies which doesnt hurt my feelings a bit
2812735 heres a round leaf sundew you see the little starburst with the almost like tentacles with beads on the end a small insect will become attracted by this scent and get stuck see how sticky that is
2812736 as you can see the ditch is all overgrown with rushes and grasses
2812737 they ceased to function right away and so it was really quite the inspired folly it was a pipe dream that just didnt work
2812738 people are interested in more than just fishing and hunting
2812739 theres a lot of people that do like to come out and see the neo tropical migratory songbirds or to photograph those rare orchids or plants or just to be out walking like this
2812740 i have been a supporter of the olympics in vancouver forever i think its fantastic i absolutely can hardly wait
2812741 but it makes me wonder how we can do what they did in only two years well its only a year and a half now isnt it
2812742 whats happening to all the people who live their lives in the periphery who arent part of the spectacle where do they go
2812743 we recognize that the right to bear arms is an important part of the american tradition and we will preserve americans continued second amendment right to own and use firearms we believe that the right to own firearms is subject to reasonable regulation but we know that what works in chicago may not work in cheyenne we can work together to enact and enforce common sense laws and improvements like closing the gun show loophole improving our background check system and reinstating the assault weapons ban so that guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists or criminals
2812744 well i can tell you i think bill clinton is hurting ill be honest with you his wife did not prevail in the primary he worked hard in it was involved in some controversial statements but trust me when people judge bill clinton and his presidency what it did for america in terms of building this economy and moving us forward hes going to do quite well i believe before the end of the day hes going to be an active supporter of the obama campaign just as hillary clinton is today
2812745 intentionam sa intram mai puternic in industria hoteliera turismul fiind in continua crestere in timp ce partea de transport rutier cel putin in momentul de fata este in scadere
2812746 inainte de tranzactie aveam 88 89 din grup iar acum detin 47 intentionez sa mai atrag si alte firme in cadrul grupului odata ce am deschis structura actionariatului intentionam sa intram si pe transportul intern de persoane precum si pe transportul aerian in prezent suntem in negocieri cu o companie aeriana de talie medie din afara care nu este prezenta si pe piata din romania
2812747 prefer sa am o felie mai mica dintr un tort mai mare
2812748 valoarea companiei va creste exponential in urma acestei fuziuni prin care am adus in actionariat oameni cu know how pe partea de turism si pe segmentul hotelier intentionam sa intram mai puternic in industria hoteliera turismul fiind in continua crestere in timp ce partea de transport rutier cel putin in momentul de fata este in scadere
2812749 aceasta crestere este sustinuta mai ales de pachetele turistice spre blugaria
2812750 intr adevar este o perioada buna pentru investitii pe bursa mai ales datorita preturilor scazute insa nu este cazul sa intram cu toti banii pe piata
2812751 vedem o oportunitate importanta de crestere in acest parteneriat in conditiile in care romtelecom dispune de cea mai extinsa retea de fibra optica si de telefonie fixa ingropata
2812752 vanzarile au evoluat intr un ritm mult mai bun si mai rapid decat ne asteptam initial
2812753 motivul pentru care managerii refuza sa se mute profesional in alt oras este fie faptul ca nu isi doresc o schimbare de cariera fie nu vor sa si paraseasca familia
2812754 in general marile companii au top managementul destul de bine asezat iar de cele mai multe ori atunci cand o pozitie la acest nivel se elibereaza sau este nou creata oportunitatea apartine mai intai candidatilor interni si anume angajatilor companiei care au dovedit performanta si loialitate si care sunt pregatiti sa faca acest pas
2812755 in domeniul industrial de exemplu pentru o pozitie de plant manager manager de fabrica n r vom tinti candidati in brasov sibiu timisoara arad sau oriunde in tara in functie de cerintele profilului dat de client pe de alta parte pentru o pozitie de director financiar piata din bucuresti ofera resurse suficiente cel putin in comparatie cu alte pozitii atat din punct de vedere volumic cat si calitativ
2812756 onorariul nostru nu variaza in functie de negocierea finala dintre client si candidat care poate fi la un nivel salarial mai mic sau mai mare in functie de domeniul de expertiza senioritate dar si domeniul de activitate din care provine candidatul
2812757 componenta variabila se poate regasi sub forma de bonus la finalizarea cu succes a unui proiect sub forma de comision la indeplinirea unui target care poate fi target de vanzari un procent din valoarea facturata sau un target de incasari un procent din valoarea incasata
2812758 aceste diferente mari se justifica in principal prin calitatea serviciilor prin know how ul dar si prin reputatia firmei respective prin nivelul de senioritate si expertiza al consultantilor al contactelor acestora in piata si nu in ultimul rand printr o metodologie diferita de lucru care aduce plus valoare in livrarea cu succes a unui proiect de executive search
2812759 un researcher consultant junior cu unu doi ani experienta castiga intre 500 si 800 euro pe luna in timp ce un partener poate castiga intre 8 000 si 10 000 de euro pe luna daca luam in considerare si bonusurile
2812760 aparent piata apartamentelor noi nu a inregistrat nicio scadere de la inceputul acestui an totusi pentru a revigora vanzarile scazute din timpul verii dezvoltatorii au lansat oferte promotionale fie oferind reduceri de pret fie incluzand locurile de parcare in pretul apartamentului
2812761 am asistat la o evolutie brusca a nivelurilor de dobanzi practicate rezultat al crizei de lichiditati existente la nivel european aspect ce a generat in mod direct o scumpire a creditelor accesate de societatile de leasing netranslatarea integrala a acestor cresteri catre partenerii de afaceri a determinat identificarea de catre societatile de leasing a unor solutii de eficientizare a activitatii
2812762 cresterea vanzarilor de credite din iunie a fost cea mai buna inregistrata din ianuarie si aproape de nivelul atins la jumatatea anului trecut s ar putea sa fie un inceput de tendinta
2812763 am vazut peste 70 de cv uri inainte de a alege noul ceo al bcr si chiar cred ca bruynseels este cel mai bun bancher de retail pe care l am intalnit sunt convins ca este hotarat sa faca treaba la bcr si l am prevenit in privinta problemelor de care s ar putea lovi ma astept ca in sase luni sa inceapa sa arate ce poate
2812764 bcr a continuat sa piarda cota de piata in semestrul i in favoarea bancilor care dau credite in franci elvetieni excluzand insa segmentul de piata in franci ne conservam pozitia iar pe zona creditelor ipotecare avem o cota stabila
2812765 cresterea vanzarilor de credite din iunie a fost cea mai buna inregistrata din ianuarie si aproape de nivelul atins la jumatatea anului trecut s ar putea sa fie un inceput de tendinta
2812766 intr un mediu de crestere a dobanzilor marjele se vor mentine
2812767 consumul de materiale de constructii a fost afectat din cauza conditiilor de creditare mai aspre si a pierderii apetitului de creditare al bancilor efectul insa nu a fost asa de puternic ca in alte tari ne asteptam ca in 2009 sa resimtim mai puternic consecintele stagnarii pietei imobiliare dupa ce vor fi finalizate o parte din proiectele incepute in anii trecuti
2812768 avand in vedere evolutia din primele sase luni consideram ca nivelul de crestere de 25 preconizat la inceputul anului este fezabil
2812769 in bulgaria si serbia suntem in faza de inceput in care ne facem cunoscuti in piata iar in moldova si ucraina suntem in proces de consolidare a afacerilor in primul semestru am inaugurat o noua filiala in ucraina la rovno oras cu peste 500 000 locuitori
2812770 o situatie nesatisfacatoare ce pune in umbra performantele bune inregistrate de multe dintre diviziile noastre
2812771 integrarea abn amro pare sa se desfasoare intr un ritm mai rapid decat se estimase ceea ce reface oarecum credibilitatea rbs iar capitalul arata putin mai bine
2812772 ne aflam in prezent intr o pozitie in care vom lua in considerare vanzarea de active numai acolo unde preturile sunt atractive
2812773 in primele sapte luni ale acestui an orkla a inregistrat o crestere de peste 50 a vanzarilor de pate de peste 40 a vanzarilor de conserve de carne si de 19 a celor de mustar
2812774 peste 5 ani este posibil sa existe o oarecare influenta a strainilor pe piata fortei de munca din romania pentru ca tendinta angajatorilor este de a aduce personal din afara este probabil sa vina 200 000 300 000 de straini dar acestia vor fi dispersati pe tot cuprinsul tarii si in domeniile neocupate
2812775 unul dintre partenerii mei de afaceri detine o companie care aduce muncitori pentru constructii si din discutiile cu el am inteles ca asiaticii sunt foarte disciplinati se inteleg si colaboreaza foarte bine cu romanii
2812776 ne confruntam cu o noutate fireasca prin care au trecut si alte tari pe termen mediu strainii de pe piata autohtona a fortei de munca contribuie la cresterea salariilor pentru ca acopera deficitul de personal existent
2812777 cei mai multi straini lucreaza in constructii productie servicii comert sportiv bancar si jocuri de noroc
2812778 daca ii intrebi pe studentii care ies de pe bancile facultatilor sau pe liceenii care nu vor sa studieze mai mult unde se vad lucrand peste cinci ani mai mult de 60 iti vor spune denumirea unei tari straine
2812779 populatia din zona rurala nu reprezinta o solutie pentru acoperirea deficitului de personal pentru ca multi dintre locuitorii de acolo traiesc datorita banilor pe care ii trimit romanii care lucreaza in strainatate
2812780 cu siguranta ca aducerea strainilor reprezinta in acest moment o solutie viabila pentru acoperirea deficitului data fiind rata mare de emigrare a romanilor in tarile vestice este clar ca acest deficit nu poate fi acoperit in alt fel pe termen scurt si mediu
2812781 date fiind problemele pietei imobiliare din spania foarte multe dezvoltari de acolo sunt in stand by si muncitorii romani au doua solutii fie sa si gaseasca contracte in alte tari fie sa se intoarca in romania unde insa vor primi jumatate din salariul din spania bine si viata in romania este mai ieftina
2812782 daca inmultim salariul platit de cateva sute de euro plus transport cazare masa si asigurari cu o perioada de timp de minimum trei ani pentru ca nu poti face un contract pe cateva luni investitia e considerabila
2812783 acum vreo doi ani am fost la un service auto din zona ploiestiului proprietarul service ului lucra la o masina dar pentru ca piesa de care avea nevoie pentru a repara vehiculul nu era potrivita a decis sa inceapa sa lucreze la alta masina proprietarul mi a spus ca nu isi permite sa piarda bani asteptand doua ore pana ce ii venea piesa ci ca prefera sa lucreze la alta masina de notat este faptul ca cei mai multi muncitori din service erau moldoveni
2812784 salariile vor creste in continuare dar nu aceasta e problema ci faptul ca nu exista o corelare intre cresterea salariilor si avansul productivitatii
2812785 pana la un nivel de stabilizare a pietei este normal ca muncitorii romani sa caute oportunitati de castiguri din munca in alte tari iar alti straini in tara noastra mai important este insa ca acest proces sa fie realizat in baza unei strategii astfel incat pe termen lung sa nu aiba efecte negative in plan social cu alte cuvinte accesul muncitorilor straini trebuie sa fie reglat prin criterii bine stabilite
2812786 de exemplu pe termen scurt aducerea muncitorilor straini pare singura solutie pentru dezvoltatorii de proiecte rezidentiale care deja sunt in intarziere cu livrarile de apartamente platesc penalitati si nu au cum altfel sa finalizeze fazele programate
2812787 pana acum 1 156 de muncitori calificati au fost preselectati pentru a munci in polonia
2812788 the increase is also due to the large number of titles in the portfolio and to the sales derived by the newly created humanitas fiction publishing house led by denisa comanescu
2812789 the money was primarily earmarked for participation and promotion at two book fairs bookfest and gaudeamus
2812790 naqueles que n o acataram entramos com uma representa o para tentar anular a chapa
2812791 se n o pudermos subir no palanque com eles melhor nem tentar disputar nada podemos enterrar o pt de camocim
2812792 eu recebi apenas um telefonema de uma pessoa que eu nem conhe o dizendo que n o poderia se coligar nem com psdb nem com dem
2812793 eu quero falar com il rio para saber exatamente o que est acontecendo mas dif cil de falar com ele
2812794 economia din zona euro s a deteriorat destul de rapid in cel de al doilea trimestru iar cresterea economica nu va fi foarte mare
2812795 suntem nevoiti sa investim in retehnologizare pentru a fi competitivi pe piata
2812796 june july and august saw the launch of 14 lem stores out of the 14 newly opened stores 7 were relocations
2812797 exista foarte multe oportunitati in europa de est unde prezenta noastra a fost pana acum limitata anul urmator vom analiza posibilitatile pentru extinderea lloyds in alte state est europene ca ungaria romania si turcia
2812798 the majority of products manufactured in romania used to be exported to the uk hungary slovakia and belgium but as investments in the logistical and retail sectors have increased so have sales on the local market
2812799 conform deciziei actionarilor la majorare urmeaza sa participe doar actionarul popa ioan ceilalti actionari urmand sa ridice dividendele aferente perioadei mentionate
2812800 efortul de selectie a candidatilor este foarte mare noi vedem de exemplu zece persoane pentru a angaja o singura persoana
2812801 nu cred ca am ajuns sa nu mai avem resurse in ceea ce priveste piata locala este putin mai greu pentru ca nu cred ca a existat o coerenta intre planurile de formare la nivel de tara in ceea ce priveste universitatile si dorinta de investitii a companiilor mari nu s au potrivit neaparat ca numere si apoi a aparut o diferenta dar nu cred ca este atat de mare
2812802 cineva care isi doreste un loc de munca placut si cald nu isi are locul in compania noastra nu este un lucru rau sa ti doresti acest lucru insa la noi este stimulata competitia este recompensata performanta si aspectul acesta se precizeaza inca de la bun inceput
2812803 daca iti place si crezi ca te potrivesti mergem mai departe daca nu nu are sens pentru ca este o pierdere de timp si de o parte si de cealalta
2812804 toate procesele pe care le am mentionat formeaza un cerc nu se poate sa ai o recrutare buna fara o dezvoltare de talente in linie cu recrutarea ori sa nu faci un management de cariera cum trebuie totul trebuie sa se lege din acest motiv n am facut niciodata un compromis in ceea ce priveste selectia
2812805 in principiu ne dorim sa crestem insa acest lucru depinde de multe elemente cum ar fi dezvoltarea pietei locale sau proiectele pe care le vom derula
2812806 planurile de training sunt individualizate se porneste de la nivelul la care se afla fiecare persoana planurile de dezvoltare sunt legate de jobul actual dar si de jobul urmator de asemenea tinem cont de nivelul de performanta al fiecaruia
2812807 nu este o solutie sa cresti salariile pentru ca acest lucru poate sa faca un om fericit timp de sase luni de zile insa mai tarziu daca in interiorul companiei nu ai cum sa stimulezi angajatii o marire de salariu nu te ajuta cu nimic relatia manager inginer trebuie sa fie cultivata prin discutii care sa i faca pe cei doi sa vina cu zambetul pe buze la serviciu
2812808 la sfarsitul zilei orice fel de decizie incepand chiar de la recrutare ii apartine business managerului rolul departamentului de resurse umane este sa echipeze compania cu tot ce are nevoie aceasta pentru ca deciziile managerilor sa fie cat mai bune
2812809 cresterea de profit la amonil din prima jumatate a anului a fost superba insa au alte probleme ei dublarea pretului la ingrasaminte a fost urmata de o dublare a costurilor cu materia prima in special gaze naturale iar din aceasta cauza compania ar putea avea probleme in a si asigura finantarea capitalului de lucru mai ales ca garantiile nu le permit atragerea de credite prea importante
2812810 azomures spre exemplu are avantajul fata de amonil in ceea ce priveste sursa de gaze apropiata dar dezavantajul cheltuielilor mai mari legate de transport
2812811 la fiecare 1 000 de euro investiti in aceasta fabrica 700 de euro sunt directionati catre reconstructia cladirii iar doar 300 de euro in productie in timp ce campofrio are in primul rand nevoie sa isi extinda capacitatea de productie
2812812 fabrica de la tulcea necesita investitii de 11 milioane de euro pentru a putea indeplini normele cerute de uniunea europeana iar in lipsa acestor investitii unitatea de productie mai are aviz de functionare pana la 31 decembrie 2009
2812813 disputa dintre cele doua parti a ranit sentimentele investitorilor din rusia
2812814 cu siguranta un conflict nu ar beneficia de increderea investitorilor si va deschide dezbaterile cu privire la riscurile politice
2812815 dupa opinia mea acestea sunt deja elemente ale unui fel de genocid impotriva poporului oset cred ca ar fi corect sa ordonati parchetului militar sa ancheteze aceste incidente mai ales pentru ca majoritatea populatiei osete are cetatenie rusa
2812816 presedintele saakasvili este in mare pericol sa si piarda tot ce a construit cat a stat de partea vestului si prin retinerea sa la provocarile rusiei
2812817 nu cred ca mai poate conta pe sprijinul statelor unite nu poti admite in nato o tara care are asemenea probleme
2812818 poate fi un semnal catre rusi ca olimpiada din 2014 de la soci nu va avea loc asa cum vrea rusia daca nu va exista progres si liniste in zona
2812819 fondul proprietatea este o investitie in care cred si am recomandat aceasta achizitie eu lucrez pentru cartesian group incepand din 2006 si acopar tarile din europa de sud est
2812820 va bateti joc de noi din dividende de 300 de milioane de lei 260 de milioane de lei le ia statul
2812821 daca aveti nevoie de ajutor ca sa listati fondul la bursa eu ma ofer benevol
2812822 multumim pentru oferta dumneavoasrta lucram 12 ore pe zi si facem tot posibilul pentru a lista fondul pe bursa
2812823 speram sa nu ajungem in instanta cu ministerul de finante
2812824 fara indoiala ca ceea ce se intampla in economie afecteaza si forta de munca insa cresterile salariale sustinute de productivitate preconizate pentru 2009 par in siguranta cel putin in prezent
2812825 data fiind incertitudinea economica actuala am fost surprinsi de faptul ca multe dintre companii nu dispun de un plan de reducere a costurilor
2812826 aparent piata apartamentelor noi nu a inregistrat nicio scadere de la inceputul acestui an totusi pentru a revigora vanzarile scazute din timpul verii dezvoltatorii au lansat oferte promotionale fie oferind reduceri de pret fie incluzand locurile de parcare in pretul apartamentului
2812827 intr adevar este o perioada buna pentru investitii pe bursa mai ales datorita preturilor scazute insa nu este cazul sa intram cu toti banii pe piata
2812828 vanzarea totala sau a unei parti din actiunile retelei de peste 120 de magazine euro gsm nu face parte din preocuparile actionariatului euro gsm desi nu este exclusa posibilitatea unor parteneriate strategice in urmatorii ani care sa contribuie la consolidarea pozitiei de lider a euro gsm pe piata retailerilor din domeniul telecom
2812829 the plant in tulcea needs 11m euro investments in order to meet eu requirements and the production unit is only authorised to operate until december 31 2009
2812830 i will have to choose between investing 11m euros in the tulcea plant making a 20m euro greenfield investment on land we own or acquiring a new plant
2812831 for each 1 000 euros invested in this plant 700 euros is spent on building reconstruction whilst just 300 euros is invested in production although campofrio primarily needs to expand its production capacity
2812832 numai in lunile iunie iulie si august s au descis 14 magazine lems din cele 14 magazine nou descise sapte au fost relocari
2812833 unii se impotrivesc politic cum este psd care propune o motiune de cenzura de te apuca rasul care nu are niciun argument
2812834 suntem multumiti pentru ca am reusit sa obtinem acest credit in conditii bune pentru companie fondurile ne vor asigura lichiditate pentru companie si pentru proiectele pe care le avem in faza finala de dezvoltare in paralel continuam procesul de vanzare a activelor care au ajuns la maturizare
2812835 no ha logrado imponerse en los mercados donde estamos nosotros

2812840 bcr a continuat sa piarda cota de piata in semestrul i in favoarea bancilor care dau credite in franci elvetieni excluzand insa segmentul de piata in franci ne conservam pozitia iar pe zona creditelor ipotecare avem o cota stabila
2812841 cresterea vanzarilor de credite din iunie a fost cea mai buna inregistrata din ianuarie si aproape de nivelul atins la jumatatea anului trecut s ar putea sa fie un inceput de tendinta
2812842 intr un mediu de crestere a dobanzilor marjele se vor mentine
2812843 am dat in judecata ministerul pentru comert turism imm si profesiuni liberale care refuza sa ne plateasca o datorie de 45 000 de lei in luna aprilie a acestui an am castigat procesul cu ei la judecatoria sectorului 1 iar in mai au facut recurs la recurs pe care l am castigat nu s a prezentat nimeni din partea ministerului
2812844 ratingurile reflecta legaturile puternice pe care kmg ep le are cu grupul de stat kazmunaigaz national company prin intermediul carora compania are acces preferential la zacamintele din kazahstan precum si la conductele de petrol si gaze
2812845 ministerul economiei si finantelor analizeaza impreuna cu celelalte institutii abilitate ministerul agriculturii si dezvoltarii rurale ministerul internelor si reformei administrative si administratia nationala a rezervelor statului posibilitatea initierii unor proiecte de acte normative referitoare la achizitionarea produselor agricole de la micii producatori
2812846 stiu ca lantul spaniol el corte ingles vrea sa intre pe piata romaneasa este posibil ca in toamna sa aiba loc o intalnire intre reprezentantii lantului si oficiali romani din administratiile locale spaniolii au luat deja legatura cu consulul general al romaniei la sevilla

2812853 armenian is the snake of the world is the enemy of the humanity
2812854 armenians for the first time brought and spread the prostitutism throughout the world
2812855 armenians always were under the rule of different states of the various religions therefore they have turned into cunning and cheat people who can hide their thoughouts intentions and senses
2812856 on the nights of march 11 12 armenian butchers bayoneted and axed to death muslim people in areas surrounding erzincan
2812857 karaguedoff and armenian cadet of the artillery regiment was the instigator of the outrage in the course of ruthless searchings in turkish homes which he had conducted in the company of armenian soldiers accustomed to such methods he had appropriated furniture and other domestic property karaguedoff was arrested together with other armenian soldiers the incidents were reported that same evening to the commander in chief in the presence of government commissioner zetaloff and his assistant on the same day the armenians murdered other turks and set fire to the turkish bazaar

2812865 we dont want songs running through heads outside the show we dont want to be waking up in the morning and by mistake start singing phantom of the opera in the shower and ive never had that
2812866 when the show started the melodies were constantly going through my head
2812867 and i would wake up in the middle of the night and hear some tunes my son loved the music so much it was playing on the radio every time i came home i had to ask him not to play it but then after a few weeks i got to the point where if somebody asked me to sing something from the show i couldnt do it somehow my brain just repressed it
2812868 ive always had nightmares of not being able to get to the theatre being stuck somewhere or harp breaks
2812869 playing music and listening to music is not exactly the same thing
2812870 its a wonderfully written harp part theres one little chord i have the audience would never know the difference but there are nights where i arpeggiate the chord exactly right there are places all through the show where i really am satisfied if i play it the way i like to play it
2812871 i know in my body when im supposed to be playing when im not playing i read books i study languages and when i pick up the instrument again its a little like tourettes syndrome i drop the book and blat out a few notes on trumpet and pick up the book again
2812872 there was a moment with the pyrotechnics theres a flash when phantom disappears and a spark from the explosion went and landed in the hair of the oboist she was uninjured but there was some damage to her hair which the hair department took care of theyre experts in that field
2812873 no one can make you relax but practitioners can facilitate and create an environment for you to feel safe and thats a big part of it
2812874 i hope people learn from our study and take it to the next step there are a lot of complaints that its hard to study alternative therapies and i think weve done that successfully and provided a model to build on

2812894 look mommy hes fill in the blank with some distinguishing physical characteristic
2812895 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2812896 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2812897 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2812898 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2812899 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2812900 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2812901 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2812902 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2812903 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2812904 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2812905 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2812906 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2812907 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2812908 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2812909 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2812910 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2812911 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2812912 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2812913 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2812914 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2812915 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2812916 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2812917 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2812918 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2812919 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2812920 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2812921 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2812922 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2812923 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2812924 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2812925 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2812926 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2812927 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2812928 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2812929 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2812930 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2812931 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2812932 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2812933 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2812934 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2812935 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2812945 in yesterdays most recent tank attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to be black possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet
2812946 there were blacks among the dead who were probably either mercenaries or instructors in the georgian armed forces
2812947 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
2812948 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
2812949 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
2812950 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2812951 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2812952 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2812953 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2812954 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2812955 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2812956 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2812957 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2812958 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2812959 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2812960 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2812961 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2812962 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2812963 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2812964 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2812965 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2812966 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2812967 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2812968 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2812969 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2812970 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2812971 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2812972 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2812973 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2812974 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2812975 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2812976 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2812977 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2812978 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2812979 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2812980 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

2812994 patients frequently suffer from joint pain often even physicians will prescribe ibuprofen when they should prescribe tylenol
2812995 the correct recommendation to help the patient is a low dose of tylenol about two grams per day that means the patient can take one extra strength tylenol 500 mg every six hours or take two every 12 hours
2812996 many physicians dont want to prescribe tylenol because it has a reputation of causing liver damage as long as it is prescribed in the low doses we have discussed it is definitely the best treatment
2812997 many patients can live with hepatitis for perhaps 50 years however if too much of the wrong medication is taken or if the patient consumes a lot of alcohol the process from hepatitis to cirrhosis can speed up
2812998 oh ya we have had this planned for a while

2813005 if youre suffering from osteoarthritis in your hands it certainly has nothing to do with this nervous tic one study at the former mount carmel mercy hospital in detroit compared 74 people age 45 and older who had been chronic knuckle crackers for decades with 226 who always left their hands alone researchers found no difference in the incidence of osteoarthritis between the two groups but there are reasons to stop this annoying habit the same study found knuckle crackers to be far more likely to have weaker grip strength and greater hand swelling both of which can limit dexterity as for osteoarthritis thats more likely due to genetics and increasing age
2813006 a real focus on post marriage counselling will bring a sense of direction and hope for the new couples who are normally different people with different tastes but who wish to stay in the union of marriage it is what sustains the viability of the marriage
2813007 there are minefields across the marriage path and yet there is no support and knowledge in post marriage times after marriage couples are usually left to struggle on their own and this is when the problems arise
2813008 this attitude depresses the marriage further and couples lose trust in the very institution that they otherwise should have been running to in times of crisis
2813009 it is interesting that people are usually asked when they will get married but hardly are they supported when conflicts arise it is in this regard that we have decided to include post marriage counselling in our church to keep couples in the business of marriage and sustaining the union as ordained by god himself
2813010 by this couples will know that conflicts abound in marriages but when it comes they will not go apart but seek counselling that will resolve the issues
2813011 the challenge is to go ahead and live our lives whatever way it unfolds

2813022 en general el panorama es de un mercado a n ajustado con una creciente demanda vulnerable a riesgos sobre la oferta
2813023 siguen habiendo riesgos alcistas esperamos que los precios permanezcan en una franja de 110 a 130 d lares durante los pr ximos 18 meses sin descartar picos de precios impulsados por los inversores

2813025 dada la reciente experiencia con los precios un rebote a m s de 200 d lares no es inviable
2813026 pensamos que el reciente fuerte declive en los precios de las materias primas son m s que un desliz temporal en una tendencia alcista
2813027 los precios de las materias primas son ahora mucho m s altos que hace un a o lo cual implica un mayor margen para m s ca das

2813046 the larger purpose of the project apart from conveying to the people on how the meanings of some sanskrit words changed with history is to highlight the ancient indian knowledge encompassing nearly 65 fields like science music geography history religion astronomy and architecture
2813047 while planning this project katre clearly visualised that the scope of the dictionary would go much beyond the sanskrit woerterbuch dictionary in german prepared between 1852 and 1875 by otto von boehtlingk and rudolph roth which was published in seven volumes from st petersburg russia
2813048 it is gratifying to note that the published volumes of the dictionary have received excellent response from sanskrit scholars both in india and outside the country
2813049 the poona sanskrit dictionary which when completed will probably be the greatest work of lexicography the world has seen and true to this observation the work done so far has already drawn attention worldwide
2813050 significant long term impact on the u s russia relations
2813051 georgia launched a cruel cynical aggression against south ossetia our citizens died residents and peacekeepers
2813052 the form this aggression took is nothing less than genocide because georgia committed heaviest crimes civilians were torched sawed to pieces and rolled over by tanks
2813053 there should be no doubt that the operation to force georgia to peace will continue and the guilty ones will be brought to account
2813054 we have set a deadline for georgian forces to withdraw from the upper part of the kodori gorge
2813055 it is an issue which needs to be sorted out we are going back to submit a report to the government for resolving the issue we believe there is a solution

2813120 sesiapa yang memelihara solat maka solat itu sebagai cahaya baginya petunjuk dan jalan selamat dan barangsiapa yang tidak memelihara solat maka sesungguhnya solat itu tidak menjadi cahaya dan tidak juga menjadi petunjuk dan jalan selamat baginya
2813121 10 orang solatnya tidak diterima oleh allah s w t antaranya 1 orang lelaki yang solat sendirian tanpa membaca sesuatu 2 orang lelaki yang mengerjakan solat tetapi tidak mengeluarkan zakat 3 orang lelaki yang menjadi imam padahal orang yang menjadi makmum membencinya 4 orang lelaki yang melarikan diri 5 orang lelaki yang minum arak tanpa mahu meninggalkannya taubat 6 orang perempuan yang suaminya marah kepadanya 7 orang perempuan yang mengerjakan solat tanpa memakai tudung 8 imam atau pemimpin yang sombong dan zalim menganiaya 9 orang orang yang suka makan riba 10 orang yang solatnya tidak dapat menahannya dari melakukan perbuatan yang keji dan mungkar
2813122 barang siapa yang solatnya itu tidak dapat menahannya dari melakukan perbuatan keji dan mungkar maka sesungguhnya solatnya itu hanya menambahkan kemurkaan allah s w t dan jauh dari allah
2813123 barangsiapa yang mengabaikan solat secara berjemaah maka allah s w t akan mengenakan 12 tindakan yang merbahaya ke atasnya tiga darinya akan dirasainya semasa di dunia ini antaranya
2813124 demi allah belum pernah aku melihat wajah secantik dan secerah wanita itu tidak lain kerana itu pasti kerana tidak pernah risau dan bersedih hati
2813125 apakah katamu hai saudaraku demi allah aku tetap terbelenggu oleh perasaan dukacita dan luka hati kerana risau dan seorang pun yang menyekutuinya aku dalam hal ini
2813126 pada suatu hari ketika suamiku sedang menyembelih kambing korban dan pada aku mempunyai dua orang anak yang sudah boleh bermain dan yang satu masih menyusu dan ketika aku bangun untuk membuat makanan tiba tiba anakku yang agak besar berkata pada adiknya
2813127 tiada seorang pun yang dapat membedakan antara sabar dengan mengeluh melainkan ia menemukan di antara keduanya ada jalan yang berbeda adapun sabar dengan memperbaiki yang lahir maka hal itu baik dan terpuji akibatnya dan adapun mengeluh maka orangnya tidak mendapat ganti yakni sia sia belaka
2813128 tidak ada balasan bagi hamba ku yang mukmin jika aku ambil keksaihnya dari ahli dunia kemudian ia sabar melainkan syurga baginya
2813129 tiga macam daripada tanda kekafiran terhadap allah merobek baju mengeluh dan menghina nasab orang

2813131 sesungguhnya kiamat itu tidak akan terjadi sebelum kamu melihat sepuluh tanda

2813133 in illinois the state version of baipa repeatedly failed thanks in large part to then state sen barack obama it only passed in 2005 after obama left
2813134 obama articulately worried that legislation protecting live aborted babies might infringe on womens rights or abortionists rights obamas clinical discourse his lack of mercy shocked me i was naive back then obama voted against the measure twice it ultimately failed
2813135 so the reason keyes said jesus christ wouldnt vote for barack obama was because of obamas fanatical support of abortion to the point of condoning infanticide
2813136 that we live in a pluralistic society and that i cant impose my religious views on another
2813137 obama insinuated opposition to abortion is based only on religion lecturing pro lifers like me to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths including those with no faith at all
2813138 i dont recall mentioning religion when i testified against live birth abortion i only recall describing a live aborted baby i held in a hospital soiled utility room until he died and a live aborted baby who was accidentally thrown into the trash
2813139 i recall comparisons made to u s laws ensuring animals being killed are treated humanely i recall testimony that late term babies feel excruciating pain while being aborted

2813194 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2813195 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2813196 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2813197 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2813198 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2813199 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy

2813261 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2813262 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2813263 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2813264 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2813265 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2813266 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2813267 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2813268 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2813374 pakiusap ko lang sa ibang manunulat gaya ni mr jun nardo na kung gusto nilang ipromote ang kanilang gustong artista o programa eh isulat na lang ang mga magagandang bagay tungkol dito at huwag ng siraan pa ang katapat hindi kalaban nitong programa

2813418 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2813419 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2813420 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2813421 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2813422 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2813423 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2813424 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2813425 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2813730 he nataraja brought out the parallels in our understanding of the universe as a dynamic interconnected unity
2813731 fritjof capra is correct that matter can not be separated from motion the error of modern physics has been in the conception of motion as the motion of matter subatomic particles rather than the wave motion of space western physics with its particles and forces fields in space time has never correctly understood the eastern worldview it is also important to understand that the ancient indian philosophers did actually know how the universe was a dynamic unity what matter was how the one thing brahman caused and connected the many things thus eastern philosophical knowledge is ultimately founded on mysticism and intuition recent discoveries on the properties of space and the wave structure of matter wolff haselhurst confirm that we can understand reality and the interconnection of all things from a logical scientific foundation

2813768 we learnt a harsh lesson and i will need to step up efforts to strengthen my side at the back
2813769 we had something to prove after last seasons catastrophic start
2813770 flavio asked why i was taking the penalty he was having a joke i think i doubt ill ever get another chance to score a hat trick
2813771 i was stuck on 99 goals and i was playing really well then unfortunately the injury happened its been a long time coming but ive been patient and worked really hard
2813772 i thought norwich should have had a penalty and im not so sure we should have had a penalty you have to take your bit of luck when it comes your way
2813773 because we had such a fantastic home record last year some of our lads thought automatically that it would happen again
2813774 you cant afford to switch off at any level you get punished we got punished twice
2813775 it must have been a close thing but i dont care if it was yards offside or not offside it was definitely my goal
2813776 all that matters over the season is that we pick up the points
2813777 i do feel were one game away from getting rid of that monkey the wait for a win
2813778 if wed have scored the first goal it might have been different
2813779 this season wont be easy the wolves are already at the door weve got to play with freedom and without fear we will improve
2813780 the toughest league in the world to get out of
2813781 but i hope other clubs would respect our position now that our season has started no manager wants a last minute rush for his players and you have to ask yourself why these clubs did not make their moves earlier
2813782 i am always getting calls from agents about my players who i mistakenly believe are under contract
2813783 it was perfect its a dream come true one of the things i have always been aware of as an athlete is that you can be a world champion but one day you become an ex world champion when you are an olympic champion you are an olympic champion for life

2813785 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2813786 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2813787 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2813788 from crowd to players to management to directors there was an apprehension because of the changes in personnel that we have had the old guard has gone and now we have to build a new one
2813789 i felt we should have won stacky picked up their man of the match award and deservedly so but that says it all really
2813790 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2813791 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2813792 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2813793 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2813794 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2813828 i am feeling good happy because this is going to let us accelerate even more our process for autonomy
2813829 certainly im bolivian from la paz so i had to vote for evo
2813830 win or lose evo seems to have settled in as the revered leader of half the country and the devil in disguise for the other half that presents a real problem for governing
2813831 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2813832 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2813833 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans
2813834 i saw the russian helicopters swoop down and bomb us with my own eyes it was terrifying so i hid in the basement for three days
2813835 i know that lots of my neighbours are dead i have no idea who is left
2813836 i dont want to be standing here helpless but we have nowhere else to go
2813837 they bombed us were being driven away we dont know where were running to
2813838 wholl take us in the place was in flames and we couldnt stay
2813839 they were very close it felt like they were right above our heads and we could hear firing coming from somewhere although the helicopters werent firing at us
2813840 where can i go i have the children here i have no car i will stay
2813841 i heard the sound of planes flying over zugdidi sometime between six and seven in the morning
2813842 i heard at least six explosions within the space of half an hour people are afraid but theres no panic were staying inside
2813843 the outskirts of zugdidi were bombarded by the russians we peaceful citizens are feeble and helpless
2813844 e come faccio a non esserci se tutti gli amici ci sono
2813845 an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of all forces to the status quo
2813846 russia must affirm that its aim is not to change the democratically elected government of georgia and that it accepts that territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
2813847 to bring up publicly the idea of president mikheil saakashvili stepping down may be an interesting signal
2813848 sometimes there are democratic leaders who do things which create great problems for their country
2813849 sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2813850 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
2813851 could not allow georgian attacks on civilians and russian peacekeepers
2813852 this is completely unacceptable especially from the lips of a representative of a country whose actions we are aware of in serbia
2813853 relations with the united states and others would be affected by its continued assault on georgia and its refusal to contribute to a peaceful conclusion of the crisis

2813856 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2813857 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
2813858 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
2813859 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
2813860 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
2813861 with a restive electorate with an economy thats sort of chugging along with a war in the background at the end of eight years of republican rule in the white house obama should be way ahead
2813862 the fact that he isnt says that there are grave doubts about senator obama
2813863 i would make the argument that part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign
2813864 hes run a negative campaign hes claimed to be something new and different and yet given these you know it is really beyond the pale to sit there and insinuate that senator mccain is somehow going to attack him for being black which is what he did for over a month
2813865 he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america

2813897 it is not only parents are given to anxiety this is true even in a country like america where girls discourage themselves because of the risk involved i feel parents need to provide full support to girls who wish to make it as pilots girls fare better in the profession than boys because of their disposition to stay focussed
2813898 i came out of difficult situations thrice during the training thanks to better judgment and confidence
2813899 i will help all such persons in terms of guidance

2814019 the europeans say stop enrichment and well talk but the iranians already did that and nothing happened
2814020 at the time of the shah we signed contracts with both france and germany and even then they didnt deliver if i were in the current regime i wouldnt trust the west they dont even give iran civilian airplane parts which is costing hundreds of lives why should they believe that they will give them enriched uranium

2814235 two young guys on the tackle so i mean were going to have to grow with them and theyre going to have to learn game by game and make mistakes that rookies make
2814236 is there really a third quest for the historical jesus
2814237 german nt scholars it appears have seized the hypothesis of the creative role of christian prophets because it both accounts for the additions to the sayings tradition and absolves the early christians from any culpability in the forging of inauthentic words of jesus in spite of the theological attractiveness of the theory however the ahistorical evidence in support of the theory lies largely in the creative imagination of scholars
2814238 the assumption of a vigorous prophetic activity in the earliest churches adding substantially to the jesus tradition is hardly borne out by what we know about such prophetic activity and our knowledge of how prophecies were received in the earliest churches raises a substantial question mark against any claim that distinctive or characteristic features of the jesus tradition originated in prophetic activity on the contrary the likelihood is that the first christian churches would have been alert to the danger of diluting or contaminating their vital foundational tradition by incorporating into it any material incoherent with its principal emphases
2814239 and if by chance anyone who had been in attendance on the elders should come my way i inquired about the words of the elder that is what according to the elders andrew or peter said or philip or thomas or james or john or matthew or any of the lords disciples and whatever aristion and the elder john the lords disciples were saying for i did not think that information from books would profit me as much as information from a living and surviving voice
2814240 inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things which have been accomplished among us 2 just as they were delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word 3 it seemed good to me also having followed all things closely for some time past to write an orderly account for you most excellent the ophilus 4 that you may know the truth concerning the things of which you have been informed
2814241 no matter how this controversial scene is interpreted it does scratch the otherwise perfect surface of this fable for it is here that consciousness comes into play an awareness of the difference between good and evil that according to the bible did not exist before the fall of man
2814242 they need sea ports they need transportation infrastructure and primarily they want to get rid of us

2814247 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2814248 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
2814249 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2814250 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2814251 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away
2814252 its a bank robbing movie so its one of those action packed films you get a little different side of me in that movie
2814253 its a new age young hip hop version of heat
2814254 these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris be the little homey
2814255 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
2814256 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
2814257 only one of us could make it over the wall
2814258 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2814259 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2814260 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2814261 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2814262 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2814263 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2814264 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2814265 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2814266 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2814267 i should have known that people would feel that way
2814268 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2814269 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2814270 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go

2814276 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2814277 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2814278 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2814279 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
2814280 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2814281 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
2814282 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
2814283 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2814284 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2814285 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign
2814286 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2814287 over the past six years the salary gaps between legislators
2814288 it grated on my democratic ears because legislators should not be thought of principally as senior managers
2814289 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2814290 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2814291 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2814292 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2814293 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2814294 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2814295 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2814296 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
2814297 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids
2814298 wake up in london go to sleep on atlanta time still my paint got more candy than your valentine
2814299 trouble i dont shy away from it i annihilate suckas in their driveway in church on sunday morning praying bout what happened friday
2814300 basically were naming everything girls like in a song so when you hear it youll understand exactly what im talking about if you dont know what girls like then im going to tell you in this song im going to let you know exactly what they like just give you a couple points its going to help you with the entire rest of your life thats what its going to help you with for sure
2814301 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
2814302 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2814303 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2814304 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2814305 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2814306 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2814307 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2814308 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2814309 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2814310 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2814311 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2814312 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2814313 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2814314 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2814315 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2814316 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2814317 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2814318 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2814319 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2814320 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2814321 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2814322 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2814323 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2814324 i got my artist tay dizm and ive already got his single beam me up featuring me and rick ross ive also got young cash coming out right now jay lyriq ive got a lot of stuff coming on my nappy boy label
2814325 i just worked on ciaras album me and kanye did it again we did another hook like two days ago
2814326 i got two records with t pain that are retarded
2814327 if you wouldve come to my wedding you would have heard the records at my reception everybody was going crazy its this one record we got thats called talk that its phenomenal everybody is like you rapping like that i been doing that its nothing for me
2814328 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2814329 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone
2814330 big man what problem you have with rohee and prittipaul singh
2814331 the notion that somehow mccain is going to get in there and be some kind of ideological newt gingrich right winger is a joke theres no way that he would do that
2814332 hes a very good legislator from my point of view because when he gets onto something he doesnt just want to introduce a bill he likes to move it and hes fearless
2814333 hes a great guy to fight an uphill battle with legislatively he keeps his word i probably shouldnt be saying this stuff but to be honest about it it was one of the better professional experiences ive ever had in my life
2814334 he does seem much more tight and less fun than he was in the 2000 campaign i worry for his sake though im supporting his opponent that his handlers are constraining him too much
2814335 its unfair because mccains a blast hes fun to be around hes certainly young in spirit hes actually very young in energy
2814336 yes he shows temper but he burns fast and he doesnt let it cloud his judgment he would not be a loose cannon in the oval office its not like hes going to pick up the red phone in a rage
2814337 he is not a guy who wants to be chummy chummy with political leaders of the party he doesnt like that sort of constraint hes an independent so he somehow managed to become the nominee of the republican party but we all know its not because he was somebody that was kissing up to the republican establishment to say the least
2814338 the notion that somehow mccain is going to get in there and be some kind of ideological newt gingrich right winger is a joke theres no way that he would do that
2814339 the purposeful design of life to any degree is easily compatible with the idea that after its initiation the universe unfolded exclusively by the intended playing out of natural laws the purposeful design of life is also fully compatible with the idea of universal common descent one important facet of darwins theory
2814340 although some religious thinkers envision active continuing intervention in nature intelligent design is quite compatible with the view that the universe operates by unbroken natural law with the design of life perhaps packed into its initial set up
2814341 this is nothing more than good old fashioned teleological natural law theory updated with the discoveries of modern science
2814342 we cannot have natural law without divine or eternal law
2814343 both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other
2814344 i admit that war has always been and will always be part of human existence
2814345 i actually agree with him that showing a biological basis for certain moral desires could conceivably reinforce traditional morality but only if we have reason to assume that these biological desires are somehow normative if one believes that natural desires have been implanted in human beings by intelligent design or that they represent permanent truths inherent in the nature of the universe it would be rational to accept those desires as a grounding for a universal code of morality

2814351 through the youth board and getting more involved in the activities throughout the year i really grew in my faith
2814352 we had on average 80 or so come each time we led bible study community night and common ground small group discussions
2814353 high school youth youth ministers chaperones priests and several bishops that said mass hearing that many people pray and sing was the most amazing thing ever
2814354 there are certain things you cant tell anybody about the tec weekend because it would ruin the surprise but its really cool
2814355 there were about 40 kids who came and around 20 high schoolers who helped run it
2814356 it was definitely a rewarding experience i wanted to show the kids that living by faith can be fun
2814357 i like performing i like that little thrill you get and i like the music the costumes just everything
2814358 if you dont concentrate and get lost you arent able to get back on

2814360 because of our culture many moms dont have anyone to turn to their mothers didnt breastfeed because formula has become so popular
2814361 were saying to a generation of women look its free its simpler its portable
2814362 the look in moms eyes is great when they have someone to talk to
2814363 they can count on us to get the right information
2814364 youve given them a gift no one else can give

2814371 people find them in their yard sometimes they open their window and they fly into their homes very often sometimes they find their pets playing with them they handle bats
2814372 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2814373 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2814374 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2814375 oh i get it i see now that we are on the outs you say i owe you money
2814376 when i make up my mind nothing will change it
2814377 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2814378 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2814379 let me tell you something wax enthusiastic and youll feel so a being causes his own feelings its the joy of creating uh
2814380 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2814381 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2814382 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2814383 dont take our starry skies for granted if you were unlucky enough to be living in some other universe you might have nothing to stare at but black holes at least thats the view of a new study that examines the nature of other universes that might support life and suggests that our cosmic habitat is nothing special after all wondrously starry skies apart the idea that certain aspects of our universe make it uniquely suited to life has never been properly tested says fred adams of the university of michigan in ann arbor you hear people say our universe is fine tuned for life that stars are rare and couldnt form if certain things were different he says the truth is no one has done the calculations adams has now rectified that situation and found that it is not unusual for stars to form that can support life
2814384 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2814385 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2814386 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2814387 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is

2814642 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2814643 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2814644 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2814645 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2814646 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2814647 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
2814648 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2814649 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2814650 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extend our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece
2814651 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2814652 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man

2814691 hi my name is matt and i am a serial procrastinator
2814692 hi matt nice to meet you tell us about yourself
2814693 okay where to start okay okay i can start with this i recently expressed a desire to look into primary school teaching as a way of finally getting myself a career and in the 2 weeks since the idea first bore fruit in my head ive done precisely nothing about it
2814694 thats disappointing matt you seem like you would make a good primary school teacher is there anything else perhaps going a bit further back
2814695 oh yeah loads too many to mention really i did film amp video studies in my degree and since finishing 5 years ago i have slowly and methodically been building up a portfolio of very little i would say the one feature length script i wrote could potentially be very good the trouble is i havent sent it to anyone well unless you count my mates some of them might have read it
2814696 but you havent done anything constructive with your degree i wonder why that is when you like films so much
2814697 i suppose i didnt really enjoy the actual filmmaking side as much as the writing side
2814698 well you wrote a script at least although the 5 year output is taking on a malick esque dimension at this stage whats your ideal job matt
2814699 writing film reviews for empire would be awesome i read it every month
2814700 and have you ever tried to contact them perhaps do some work experience
2814701 not in the strictest sense i did send something to them asking what kind of jobs they had work experience etc but that was a few years ago now i didnt hear anything back
2814702 a pretty run of the mill customer services job i dont really enjoy it
2814703 i should do that really 4 years is a long time to be doing something you dont really like
2814704 indeed so what else is there what are you good at
2814705 loads of stuff i can play the guitar okay my tolerance for alcohol is absolutely top drawer and out of all my friends i can cope with a really bad e comedown the easiest
2814706 good for you but i meant in the employment arena
2814707 oh okay er im punctual and i have a good standard of personal hygiene when i do a brew run i can always remember what beverage everyone has without having to write it on a post it note other stuff i have a good grasp of english ive wrote the occasional piece or article and when ive shown it to people they tell me i should be a writer or something
2814708 its not like i havent tried honestly ive started about 5 novels but i get bored really quickly and just bin them off
2814709 i dont think youre lazy i think you have a very short creative attention span and you think that something is going to fall into your path all on its own
2814710 yeah maybe thats it how do i stop it or rather how do i improve and sort my life out
2814711 theres no easy answer im afraid you need some goals manageable and attainable pick one idea or job or task and stick to it until youve seen it through
2814712 customer was refused his rma due to being in england

2814714 i want to talk to smoky barrett or ill kill myself
2814715 you want to include numbers with letters the longer the better obviously but you want to pick something you can memorize and not have to write down something thatll be mnemonic like
2814716 one for you two for me thats a phrase that sticks in my mind so i change it a little and add some numbers and come up with 1forutwo4me silly but ill remember it and itll be hard for someone to guess by accident
2814717 smoky its alan sorry to bother you today but we got a situation
2814718 im in canoga park standing in front of a house scene of a triple homicide bad scene twist is theres a sixteen year old girl inside shes got a gun to her head and says shell only talk to you
2814719 dont worry about it we were just about to take a break anyway give me the address and callie and i will meet you there soonest
2814720 see if you can figure out what we should do with all those stuffed animals
2814721 lets see what all the shouting is about shall we
2814722 do you mind if i have my guy fill me in no offense intended
2814723 a call came into 911 about an hour and a half ago from the next door neighbor widower by the name of jenkins jenkins says that the girl sarah kingsley had stumbled into his front yard dressed in a nightgown covered in blood
2814724 how did he know she was in the front yard
2814725 his living room is in the front of the house and he keeps his drapes open until he goes to bed he was watching tv saw her out of the corner of his eye
2814726 hes shook but he musters up enough courage to go out and see what the problem is said she was unfocused his word and mumbling something about her family being murdered he tries to get her to come into his house but she screams and runs off re enters her own home
2814727 i take it he was wise enough not to follow her
2814728 yeah the heroics only went as far as his own front yard
2814729 sims and butler arrive poke their heads in the front door which was wide open and try and get her to come back out shes unresponsive after talking it over they decide to go in and get her dangerous maybe but neither of them are rookies and theyre worried about the girl
2814730 they enter the home and its a fucking bloodbath from the get go
2814731 no no ones been in there since she got hold of a weapon so they go in and its obvious that something bad happened and that it happened recently lucky for us sims and butler have dealt with murder scenes before so they dont lose their heads they give anything that looks like evidence a wide berth
2814732 yeah they hear noise on the second floor and call out for the girl no answer they proceed up the stairs and find her in the master bedroom along with three dead bodies shes got a gun
2814733 a 9mm of some kind per the officers things change fast at that point now theyre nervous theyre thinking maybe shes responsible for whatever happened here and they point their weapons at her tell her to drop the gun etc etc thats when she puts it to her own head
2814734 right shes crying and starts screaming at them saying quote
2814735 lieutenant dawes knew your name and got someone to get a hold of me i came here checked things out called you
2814736 we currently have three negotiating teams in la some guy decided today was the day he was going to jump off the top of the roosevelt hotel in hollywood thats one theres a dad about to lose custody of his kids who decided to put a shotgun to his head thats two the last team got t boned in an intersection this morning on their way to a training seminar if you can believe that
2814737 it was a truck that hit them theyll live but theyre all in the hospital were on our own
2814738 i could handle this all kinds of ways agent barrett tear gas non lethal ammo but tear gas is going to fuck up what sounds like a murder scene and non lethal ammo well she could still shoot herself even after getting hit with a bean bag
2814739 seems like the best plan involves you going in there and talking to a crazy teenager holding a gun
2814740 you gotta wear body armor and have your weapon out and ready to fire
2814741 she can put out candle flames and shoot holes through quarters honey love
2814742 targets are one thing have you ever shot a person
2814743 right so body armor gun out and if it comes down to a choice between you and her do what you gotta do hopefully you can talk her down
2814744 do we have any idea at all why shes asked for me
2814745 not much people here are into the good fences make good neighbors philosophy the old guy jenkins did say that she was adopted
2814746 yeah about a year ago hes not close with the family but he and the dad talked to each other from their driveways every now and then thats how he knew who the girl was
2814747 its possible no one else had anything substantial to offer the kingsleys were good neighbors meaning they were quiet and minded their own business
2814748 if im acting as negotiator that means i have command for now any problems with that
2814749 i dont want anyone getting trigger happy dawes no matter how long it takes dont go behind my back and start rappelling from the roof or anything cute
2814750 ive been to a few of these agent barrett contrary to popular belief my guys arent itching to shoot someone
2814751 ive worked with our own swat lieutenant i know all about getting pumped up for a call
2814752 in that case do you have some body armor i can borrow
2814753 i did but it was recalled mine and four hundred others in the same lot faulty composition resulting in them being overly brittle or something like that im waiting for a replacement
2814754 except that i had reason to wear it three times before they figured out that it might not actually stop a bullet
2814755 vest wont protect you from a head shot anyway its all a roll of the dice
2814756 ill flash them a little leg alan will terrify them end of problem
2814757 key is to listen no lies unless youre sure you can get away with them its about rapport so lies are a deal breaker watch for emotional triggers and give them a nice wide berth
2814758 if i was going to be careful i wouldnt go in there at all

2814787 lets state clearly that we are ready to put an end to the war that we will withdraw from south ossetia that we will sign an agreement on non use of force
2814788 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations

2814800 nein denn die lebenshaltungskosten sind drastisch gestiegen deshalb halte ich eine erh hung des regelsatzes f r erwachsene auf 418 euro pro monat durchaus f r angemessen
2814801 wir haben uns bereits auf bundesebene daf r eingesetzt dass die regelleistung f r kinder neu festgelegt wird ich halte eine erh hung um mindestens 50 euro monatlich f r notwendig ich hoffe dass der bundestag dar ber jetzt entscheiden wird

2814804 sie sollten sozialtarife anbieten und zwar f r alle deren einkommen unter der pf ndungsfreigrenze von 990 euro netto liegt hier muss es aber eine mengenbegrenzung geben denn auch untere einkommensgruppen sind zum energiesparen angehalten

2814850 were used to the phrase one bad apple can spoil the whole bunch
2814851 of late the axiom is more accurately applied to tomatoes
2814852 the recent salmonella st paul scare which took tomatoes out of stores and restaurants after more than 1 300 infections in 43 states and canada is reported to have cost tomato growers in excess of 100 million in losses as concern spread restaurants began posting signs that they were either using tomatoes not involved in the recall or that they werent using tomatoes at all it seemed unsafe to eat any tomato with new aspects and concerns arising via the media nearly every day
2814853 and the biggest news was yet to come there never was a bad tomato
2814854 a new technology being deployed by texas based organic alliance inc pink sheets orgc might just be the answer
2814855 with the companys implementation of the gs1 system for its produce it can improve traceability and consumer safety enabling growers and the government to be able to quickly cite the origin of a tomato in question allowing for the expeditious inspection and eliminating unnecessary suspects in the search

2814857 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2814858 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2814859 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2814860 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2814861 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2814862 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2814863 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2814864 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2814865 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2814866 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2814867 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
2814868 practically all living things human and animal were literally seared to death
2814869 as a consequence of the use of the new bomb against the town of hiroshima on aug 6 most of the town has been completely destroyed and there are numerous dead and wounded among the population
2814870 and the cruel sight resulting from the attack is so impressive that one cannot distinguish between men and women killed by the fire the corpses are too numerous to be counted
2814871 the destructive power of this new bombs spreads over a large area people who were outdoors at the time of the explosion were burned alive by high temperature while those who were indoors were crushed by falling buildings
2814872 unable to obtain a definite check up on the extent of the casualties
2814873 authorities were having their hands full in giving every available relief possible under the circumstances
2814874 to create the impression that the japanese are cruel people
2814875 may have given the united states war leaders guilty consciences
2814876 they may be afraid that their illegal and useless and needless bombing may eventually bring protest from the american people unless some means of hardening them can be provided
2814877 how will the united states war leaders justify their degradation not only in the eyes of the other peoples but also in the eyes of the american people how will these righteous thinking american people feel about the way their war leaders are perpetuating this crime against man and god
2814878 will they condone the whole thing on the ground that everything is fair in love and war or will they rise in anger and denounce this blot on the honor and tradition and prestige of the american people
2814879 authorized quarters in tokyo made the following statement on aug 8 with regard to the united states disregard for humanity
2814880 international law lays down the principle that belligerent nations are not entitled to unlimited choice in the means by which to destroy their opponents
2814881 this is made clear by article 22 of the hague convention consequently any attack by such means against open towns and defenseless citizens are unforgivable actions the united states ought to remember that at the beginning of the fighting in china it protested to japan on numerous occasions in the name of humanity against smaller raids carried out by japan
2814882 the right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited
2814883 all of the dead and injured were burned beyond recognition
2814884 wed all like to produce highly usable useful and desirable products
2814885 the overall experience people have with a product combines three elements usability usefulness and desirability
2814886 people effectively make compromises on usability to get a high return on the other two elements we see it all the time
2814887 part of the ipods dominance in the market is because of its innate usability and desirability but there are definitely other music players with more functionality less cost and that are more open to alternative music supplies
2814888 the palm pilot really focused on usefulness usability was a secondary consideration

2814894 were definitely seeing a very large adoption rate for blade servers by customers locally compared to any other market in asia pacific
2814895 were not really seeing any slowdown of growth from our customer base
2814896 there are so many opportunities in large enterprise upgrades channel driven smb and midmarket installations that sellers in australia will find no shortage of opportunities regardless of what is happening in the rest of the world
2814897 i think people would like to sell into that market but its a bad fit for blades
2814898 smbs would be much better off purchasing a simple rack server than taking on the overhead associated with blades
2814899 no person of color is safe from this treatment anywhere regardless of their obedience to the law skin color has become evidence of the propensity to commit crime and police use this evidence against minority drivers
2814900 driving while black racial profiling on our nations http www aclu org racialjustice racialprofiling 15912pub19990607 html
2814901 police use traffic stops as a pretext in order to fish for evidence both anecdotal and quantitative data show that nationwide the police exercise this discretionary power primarily against african americans and latinos
2814902 fighting crime is surely a high priority but it must be done without damaging other important values the freedom to go about our business without unwarranted police interference and the right to be treated equally before the law without regard to race or ethnicity and unless we address this problem all of us not just people of color stand to lose
2814903 numerous fish populations in the delta are crashing or in precipitous decline millions of salmon and other species continue to die annually as a result of both the direct and indirect impacts of the state and federal water project pumps despite the numerous efforts over the years to restore habitat for fish this legislation requires the state and federal projects that pump water out of the delta to mitigate for these losses which have huge negative impacts on our states fisheries and the commercial and sport fishing industries that contribute billions of dollars to our economy
2814904 cspa has repeatedly urged our government to correct the impacts caused by the water projects over the past fifty years the direct and indirect impacts caused by the project operations have only been partially mitigated at best and this is one of the principal causes for the declines of our central valley fisheries there is no way to begin to effectively recover and restore our once world class fisheries including some two thirds of all the states salmon unless this fundamental problem is fixed many millions of fish are lost each year add this up over the some sixty years that the projects have been on line and you have a major reason for the fishery disaster we now are forced to resolve these impacts or see our fisheries continue their head long collapse into extinction
2814905 such a transparent public process is critical to ensure appropriate mitigation obligations instead of the past deals behind closed doors between agencies that failed to properly protect the publics fisheries
2814906 cspa and the other fishing and environmental groups working to pass this legislation are urging all anglers and concerned citizens to contact their state senator and request support for passing this bill hundreds of letter from our grassroots have helped persuade the legislature to pass this critical legislation to begin the process of restoring our fisheries if anglers and the public want to see this bill pass it is absolutely critical that they tell the people who represent them in the state senate now

2814996 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2814997 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go

2815000 are you recruiting if youre through with me why do you keep talking about me
2815001 california fagg0ts can go marry their dogs for all you care
2815002 ask not what your country can do for you demand it
2815003 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2815004 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2815005 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2815006 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2815007 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2815008 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2815009 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics
2815010 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china
2815011 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games i do not think it is related to the olympics
2815012 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president
2815013 competition can create some challenging feelings but the democrats have shown again and again that we get on board and that we work together
2815014 the stakes are very very high i know that both senator clinton and president clinton will have key roles in the convention and i expect that once were there that everybody is going to be together in a great way to do a historic job of turning out democratic voters and also independent and disgruntled republican voters for barack obama in november
2815015 theres a danger of there being too much of the clinton family at the convention its important that we acknowledge bill clinton as a great former president its important that senator clintons public service record and her historic candidacy be acknowledged and so sure look lionizing and appreciating the great leaders of the party is something that we always do at these conventions and this one will be no different but it is all part of a unified effort
2815016 but i can tell you this hillary clinton and president clinton are integral parts of our convention in denver their people are not only welcome to this convention we need their help
2815017 now lets understand weve gone through a bruising primary season between these two excellent candidates and there are some people still healing from that i understand it but in the end i believe that the hillary clinton supporters and hillary herself are definitely committed to obamas candidacy
2815018 im holding a fundraiser two fundraisers actually for her next week to retire her debt we as democrats have to come together so i dont believe a roll call would be helpful
2815019 important for us to be strong against senator mccain who will be a formidable opponent
2815020 russia had to move in if only to save face
2815021 should russia confine its efforts to south ossetia it still might emerge out of this mess as the power who moved in to stop bloodshed
2815022 should russia move further into georgia it will be deemed the aggressor
2815023 there are indications that exchanges of fire are continuing and the georgian forces have not been fully withdrawn from the conflict zone
2815024 the russians need control over energy routes from central asia and the caspian sea
2815025 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2815026 it the blockade is necessary for preventing arms shipments to georgia by sea
2815027 police cars are driving round telling the population through loudspeakers to prepare for evacuation
2815028 this is completely unacceptable especially from the lips of a representative of a country whose action we are aware of in iraq afghanistan and serbia
2815029 we are urging an immediate ceasefire to the fighting in south ossetia and calling for a resumption of direct dialogue between the parties
2815030 there are lots of georgian bodies in different parts of the city
2815031 there is a whole entrance of a house full of bodies on geroyev street there is a body of the dead in all the house and something needs to be done quickly
2815032 people know everything that there is to know about schools in new york
2815033 unfortunately in this country we dont have that kind of information about schooling
2815034 what we are better off identifying is the kind of extra value that education offers so that we measure the progress people are making not the raw results
2815035 all information other than those things of course that are subject to privacy provisions should be made open and accountable to parents to the broader community
2815036 but in the end the focus has to be on the child and how they are progressing and what we are doing to improve their educational outcomes
2815037 were now into our fourth day and were very concerned
2815038 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury
2815039 but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2815040 im going to do everything i can to step up to any problems that are going to face the country but again i look forward to doing other things you know next year
2815041 i believe it is going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all of the housing problems
2815042 were going to continue to have turmoil in our capital markets
2815043 the long term economic fundamentals of the united states compare very favorably
2815044 well we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2815045 i think it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are important to our capital markets broadly
2815046 my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2815047 we have a regulatory system that is very outdated it was put in place many years ago
2815048 computerworld dispels myths about the history of modern day computers or more appropriately

2815051 noyce of intel said it was an intriguing idea and that intel could do it but it would be a
2815052 this facility was allowed under zoning that has been there for well over a decade
2815053 we need to wait and see exactly what the cause of the explosion was
2815054 virtually all conventional pin tumbler locks are vulnerable to this method of attack and frankly nobody has really considered it or looked at it before
2815055 when you have a high security lock you dont expect this to be able to happen
2815056 key control is supposed to make this impossible to happen thats what youre paying for
2815057 basically weve destroyed medecos key control because we can make plastic keys for any of their m3 locks and a lot of their biaxial locks which is their last generation of locks
2815058 youre an employee and you loan it to somebody or your kid takes it off your key ring and makes a copy and tells his friends to break into the facility i can give you a lot of scenarios
2815059 if youre a security manager for the federal reserve or citibank you have a belief that what the company is telling you is true that unless its authorized nobody can reproduce your keys
2815060 so if you give a key to an employee you dont have to worry about it and thats the problem its not true
2815061 this attack you dont need to know what youre doing
2815062 basically if someone came to me before and said they could pick a medeco lock id say youre crazy you dont know what youre talking about if they told me they could open it with plastic the same thing id say youre crazy
2815063 locksmiths dont have a clue what is going on your locksmith will tell you this is impossible
2815064 because they were able to determine the angles of the bidding from the scanned picture of the key
2815065 basically weve destroyed medecos key control because we can make plastic keys for any of their m3 locks and a lot of their biaxial locks which is their last generation of locks
2815066 lets use old credit cards instead of spending hours milling brass and such
2815067 use bilevel locks on maintenance closets break rooms and conference rooms that need less protection with bilevel locks you still control key duplication without the expense for higher security against picking bumping and force type attacks that you dont need on all doors
2815068 they were able to create bump keys for the locks after spending months analyzing medecos published key codes
2815069 if i have physical access to the key i can fabricate an exact copy of the key
2815070 this attack you dont kneed to know what youre doing
2815071 screw it were tired of hearing about new flaws discovered in our brands every couple of months well just force medeco to use the abloy protec key in an upcoming product line these questions about our ability to protect government interests is embarrassing
2815072 much of fleetprides future growth will be fueled by expansion into markets where we currently do not have representation
2815073 by seeking out companies such as truck amp trailer supply that have a strong existing client base we can rapidly expand our national footprint we are currently evaluating similar opportunities all across the u s
2815074 truck amp trailer supply is a good solid business with seasoned employees and a loyal customer base
2815075 fleetpride is known for fostering strong relationships with its employees which is just one of the reasons why we are looking forward to welcoming the truck amp trailer supply team into the fleetpride family
2815076 i was pretty confident that in the end i was probably going to have to make a move with brandon
2815077 doing it at this time is partly because he has been a loyal 49er for the last six years this gives him an opportunity to get with another squad he wasnt getting as many reps as i know hed like to have

2815105 it would take at least six months to reconfigure the states payroll system
2815106 legacy computer systems like the ones used in california are outdated slow and costly yet they are still being widely used by many states
2815107 cagw supports the investment necessary to improve the use of technology by all levels of government unfortunately legislators in washington d c and state capitals have not provided sufficient oversight or funding for these projects
2815108 tried to modernize its payroll system throughout the past decade
2815109 the use and costs of legacy systems particularly in state governments deserves further study and analysis
2815110 an aging it infrastructure and a graying workforce to support it pose significant challenges for policymakers state leaders must take action on this issue

2815119 estimamos que este es un tema que hay que debatir somos partidarios de hacer una modificaci n
2815120 nosotros creemos que se est produciendo una contaminaci n y el efecto multiplicador en la inflaci n porque todo est en unidad de fomento
2815121 en nuestra opini n la uf adem s de producir un efecto multiplicador creciente produce un da o enorme en los sectores m s vulnerables del pa s que son los trabajadores con la p rdida del poder adquisitivo de tal modo que nosotros planteamos una revisi n una discusi n de esta materia porque no puede ser que los sectores empresariales protejan sus ingresos en uf y los trabajadores sigan perdiendo poder adquisitivo recibiendo sus remuneraciones en pesos

2815140 i believe that the position of the international community supported by australia is that georgia is an independent state its territorial sovereignty should be respected and therefore all states should exercise restraint and that includes the russian federation

2815158 look i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd
2815159 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2815160 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2815161 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
2815162 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd
2815163 we withstood the storm we calmed down and we just played a lot better basketball
2815164 maybe this was our biggest mistake that we think on the floor that this can be continued you know

2815173 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2815174 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2815175 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2815176 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2815177 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2815178 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2815179 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2815180 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2815181 we have agreement in principle on the creation of a united list and we have
2815182 but we are still trying to hammer out the details of how we will choose the list that will run in the next elections

2815186 even if israeli forces stay there two years and destroy the hamas regime down to the last office and the last activist in the aftermath israel is controlling another people against their will and the palestinian people when they compare the two will choose hamas and not those who talk peace
2815187 everyone knows that when the truce was declared there were already hundreds of grad missiles there
2815188 even if israeli forces stay there two years and destroy the hamas regime down to the last office and the last activist in the aftermath israel is controlling another people against their will and the palestinian people when they compare the two will choose hamas and not those who talk peace

2815222 you get a lot of people who probably feel the credit crunch and although the vegetables are not all the same size and perfect they are grown naturally and people just buy bags full of them
2815223 the price of organic produce at the supermarket is through the roof at the moment
2815224 we definitely make savings with an allotment and we know where this food has come from its all been grown with our own loving touch and the flavour is so much better
2815225 when i first came out here most of the plots were occupied and gradually over the years it dropped off until less than half were in use

2815229 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2815230 n either post national political reporter jonathan weisman nor milbank called the source
2815231 house democratic aides got up thursday morning and decided that the quotes looked bad while not challenging the quotations themselves they said that the quotes were out of context this is interesting because our source who was among the people complaining about the quotes yesterday sent us the quotes in writing in an email wednesday night evidently no recording was made so well probably never know the exact wording
2815232 my colleague jonathan weisman and i believe the quote was correct as written and that this supposed context is a recreation after the fact by democratic aides who were worried about how the quote looked perhaps obama didnt mean for it to come out that way but theres every reason to believe it did
2815233 house leadership aides pushed back against interpretations of this comment as self aggrandizing saying that when the presumptive democratic nominee said i have become a symbol of the possibility of america he was actually trying to deflect attention from himself
2815234 i cant say whether the first rendition was more accurate than the second i can say those providing the second rendition had good reason to supply context that would nullify the first i can also say i trust the suppliers of both renditions
2815235 an understanding going back years that he is giving me privileged information from closed meetings it is by definition on background with someone you interact with constantly there just arent the formalities of sourcing on every conversation and e mail
2815236 unimpeachable when he gives you a quote you can take it to the bank you dont need to go around verifying it with others
2815237 i know his grandmother lives in hawaii and i know hawaii is a state
2815238 weve also seen several morphs of this spam over the past couple of days
2815239 this is likely in response to all of the media attention and awareness that has been brought up over the past couple of days
2815240 my assumption is that they took the time and effort to do some reconnaissance of sites which are vulnerable to remote file inclusion or other type of remotely exploitable flaw within their web applications that would allow someone to locally host all the malicious files
2815241 i wouldnt be surprised if i find out that someone has basically went through all keylogged cpanel passwords he obtained through his botnet or through the access to a botnet that he temporarily rented

2815255 can you believe that teacher i cant believe he did that and i have all this homework he is so
2815256 we believe there are numerous people who have information about what happened who are not coming forward any time witnesses are untruthful or dont want to come forward it casts suspicion over the situation
2815257 his injuries were so severe he needed to be transported to a trauma center
2815258 last time i spoke with the folks at shands it was unclear whether or not he would survive
2815259 for example one person said the crime occurred outside when we know that in fact it occurred inside
2815260 when people are untruthful it leaves everything on the table we dont have any idea what the circumstances surrounding the shooting are were basically starting from scratch
2815261 apakah perumpamaan penghuni surga yang dijanjikan kepada orang orang bertakwa yang di dalamnya ada sungai sungai dari air yang tidak berubah rasa dan baunya sungai sungai dari air susu yang tidak berubah rasanya sungai sungai dari khamr arak yang lezat rasanya bagi peminumnya dan sungai sungai dari madu yang disaring dan mereka memperoleh di dalamnya segala macam buah buahan dan ampunan dari rabb mereka sama dengan orang yang kekal dalam neraka dan diberi minuman dengan air yang mendidih sehingga memotong motong ususnya
2815262 dan orang orang yang paling dahulu beriman merekalah yang paling dulu masuk surga mereka itulah orang yang didekatkan kepada allah berada dalam surga kenikmatan segolongan besar dari orang orang yang terdahulu dan segolongan kecil dari orang orang yang kemudian mereka berada di atas dipan yang bertahtakan emas dan permata seraya bertelekan di atasnya berhadap hadapan mereka dikelilingi oleh anak anak muda yang tetap muda dengan membawa gelas cerek dan sloki piala berisi minuman yang diambil dari air yang mengalir mereka tidak pening karenanya dan tidak pula mabuk dan buah buahan dari apa yang mereka pilih dan daging burung dari apa yang mereka inginkan
2815263 dan di dalam surga itu ada bidadari bidadari yang bermata jeli laksana mutiara yang tersimpan baik
2815264 dan di dalam surga surga itu ada bidadari bidadari yang sopan menundukkan pandangannya tidak pernah disentuh oleh manusia sebelum mereka penghuni penghuni surga yang menjadi suami mereka dan tidak pula oleh jin
2815265 sesungguhnya kami menciptakan mereka bidadari bidadari dengan langsung dan kami jadikan mereka gadis gadis perawan penuh cinta lagi sebaya umurnya
2815266 seandainya salah seorang wanita penduduk surga menengok penduduk bumi niscaya dia akan menyinari antara keduanya penduduk surga dan penduduk bumi dan akan memenuhinya bau wangi wangian dan setengah dari kerudung wanita surga yang ada di kepalanya itu lebih baik daripada dunia dan isinya
2815267 kami adalah wanita wanita pilihan yang terbaik istri istri kaum yang termulia mereka memandang dengan mata yang menyejukkan
2815268 kami adalah wanita wanita yang kekal tidak akan mati kami adalah wanita wanita yang aman tidak akan takut kami adalah wanita wanita yang tinggal tidak akan pergi
2815269 dan barangsiapa taat kepada allah dan rasul nya niscaya allah memasukkannya ke dalam surga yang mengalir di dalamnya sungai sungai sedang mereka kekal di dalamnya dan itulah kemenangan yang besar

2815271 the entire episode appears to be a big manipulative game played by sai the national dope testing laboratory and the ioa against a sportsperson whose dream for olympics has been shattered
2815272 administration does not want any negative environmental news before the 2004 election
2815273 we have increased our budget at a responsible 4 percent we have funded our priorities we have paid down all the available debt we have prepared for contingencies and we still have money left over
2815274 the growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs the people of america have been overcharged and on their behalf i am here asking for a refund
2815275 it almost seems like it should be the same but isnt
2815276 its a bit cheeky for the police to say that we had to be rescued when for starters we werent in any danger and secondly they were the ones who had confiscated our safety boat this morning
2815277 it shows how serious we are about stopping climate change that people from all walks of life were prepared despite blatantly intimidatory policing to take direct action to disrupt e on this olympic effort certainly deserves a gold medal
2815278 its been a great today but a real victory for us will be when we have conclusively scuppered e ons coal fuelled mania if hutton gives the green light to this power plant e on can expect to be seeing a lot more of us in the future
2815279 the government claims to care about climate change but is pressing ahead with new coal fired power stations
2815280 now we discover that the home office is paying the police to harass and attack people who are peacefully opposing this decision its not hard to put two and two together
2815281 it has now become impossible for citizens to assert their views against the money and influence of a wealthy few the only option left is for us to take personal responsibility for the actions where the government is failing us for the sake of our children tomorrow i am willing to peacefully break the law in order to draw a line in the sand its time more politicians joined me
2815282 this is the clearest expression yet of the widespread public disapproval for e ons plans to build new coal plants
2815283 despite the police campaign of intimidation and harassment thousands have turned out to stop this environmental catastrophe people across the country are showing they are no longer prepared to sit back and watch politicians andcompanies destroy our future today the climate movement has come of age

2815287 grab your car seat your new car is around back
2815288 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
2815289 russia had to move in if only to save face
2815290 should russia confine its efforts to south ossetia it still might emerge out of this mess as the power who moved in to stop bloodshed
2815291 should russia move further into georgia it will be deemed the aggressor
2815292 im chinese so i wish china can sort of beat the u s

2815297 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2815298 the personhood amendment could be something that gets social conservatives out to vote
2815299 a kind of 1930s style conflict between unions and management
2815300 i dont think you could just win with only union voters
2815301 did george bush carry colorado in 2004 because of voter initiatives probably not
2815302 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2815303 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2815304 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2815305 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2815306 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2815307 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2815308 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2815309 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor

2815318 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2815319 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2815320 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2815321 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2815322 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2815323 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2815324 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2815325 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor

2815334 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2815335 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2815336 never start with the head the victim gets all fuzzy
2815337 cut consumption while embarking on a serious program of alternative fuels and energy sources
2815338 and obama has said over and over again that offshore drilling will not have any significant impact on us oil production or prices at the pump but he recognizes that the republicans have decided to drown out all debate by endlessly shouting the new newt gingrich mantra
2815339 if oil prices did drop after releasing maybe 70 million barrels that would vindicate this strategy if oil prices did not drop that would demonstrate how useless the strategic reserve is
2815340 the smog hanging over beijing as the olympic games open has bemused athletes and onlookers particularly those from australia who find anything other than clear blue skies unsettling the thick haze comes from many sources from cooking fires to cars and coal fired power stations
2815341 the chinese authorities have done what they can to mitigate it but so far at least it has proved unstoppable
2815342 the olympic games in beijing may well mark the start of chinas global ascendancy in the 21st century the array of national leaders who have made their way to the olympic city many more than have attended previous games shows they sense a new era is dawning
2815343 within two decades according to some projections chinas economy will pass the united states to be the largest on the planet with money comes power and this century may also see china become the leading superpower
2815344 however things turn out the rise of china will continue to have consequences for world and regional security a world in which china is the leading player will look rather different from the one we are accustomed to
2815345 there is a need instead to push the governments of myanmars neighbors to unite against the regime
2815346 in this anniversary year the generals have to be shown that their behavior is not acceptable asean is finally doing its bit china must now also use its influence to push the agenda india and russia have to follow suit it is in everyones interest that myanmar be lifted from its sorry circumstances and be allowed to prosper

2815361 our study suggests that even modest reductions in overall smoking rates may save lives in fact quitting smoking is the most important step smokers can take to improve their overall health and that of their loved ones people who do smoke should smoke outside the house to help protect themselves and their families from home fires and exposure to secondhand smoke a known human carcinogen
2815362 home fire deaths have declined during the past several decades and this decline has paralleled reductions in smoking
2815363 we work hard to keep our homes safe and it just makes good sense to help people understand that if they can change their smoking habits we may continue to reduce these tragedies

2815373 during an operation at a salem hospital last summer an orthopedic surgeon frustrated by a pair of scissors that wouldnt cut threw them and narrowly missed a nurse in many hospitals outbursts from a top surgeon who generates significant revenue or a star researcher who wins huge grants often have been tolerated but in this instance north shore medical center disciplined the doctor who threw scissors and required mandatory team training for all operating room staff under a recent policy requiring physicians to treat their colleagues with civility and respect north shore is part of an emerging effort to crack down on what some call healthcare road rage the push is inspired by a growing body of research suggesting that swearing yelling and throwing objects are not just rude and offensive to co workers but hurt patients by increasing the likelihood of medical errors

2815378 tennessee and its residents waistlines have achieved a big but unwelcome distinction in 2007 the state joined just two others alabama and mississippi where 30 percent or more of adults are obese according to new u s centers for disease control and prevention data experts point to a collection of personal and public choices as driving the rise of obesity in southern states such as tennessee but the south isnt alone in the roughly 20 years since the cdc began tracking obesity across the united states the problem has grown in every state no state has ever reversed the trend but thats not keeping tennessee from trying the numbers are generating state policy and community initiatives aimed at reducing the number of tennesseans who are living with and dying from the preventable conditions excess weight can cause but with a problem so pervasive the fix is more complex than a crash diet

2815380 democrats shaped a set of principles saturday that commits the party to guaranteed health care for all heading off a potentially divisive debate and edging the party closer to the position of barack obamas defeated rival hillary clinton the partys platform committee moved smoothly through a range of issues for the fall campaign and approved a document that will go to the democratic convention in denver this month for adoption there was little dissent or room for it in the days meeting and a compromise on health policy took one flash point off the table obama soon to be the democratic nominee has stopped short of proposing to mandate health coverage for all

2815386 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2815387 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2815388 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2815389 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2815390 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2815391 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad

2815405 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade

2815416 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2815417 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2815418 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2815419 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2815420 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2815421 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2815422 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2815423 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
2815424 for the moment nothing legally would prevent them junta members from running
2815425 but whether the members or the president run it all depends on what the future dictates
2815426 for now we have other problems to surmount and the main one is holding elections as soon as possible
2815427 what he had done risked driving the country toward catastrophe
2815428 he was acting like a dictator like somebody who wants to ruin the nation
2815429 we told him thats not the way to do things the military chiefs have arms and munitions they have men under their command they are responsible for securing the country and you cannot just fire them all like that
2815430 we are a moderate muslim country we dont want terrorism here
2815431 but we cant release him now for the security of the country

2815445 no we dont believe that any woman should have this choice no woman should be authorized to stay at home to raise her children society should be totally different women should not have that choice precisely because if there is such a choice too many women will make that one
2815446 as a teenager i assumed legalized abortion was necessary for women to attain their educational and career goals so its not surprising that when i became pregnant at 18 i had an abortion
2815447 i was completely unprepared for the emotional fallout after the abortion i thought the abortion would erase the pregnancy i thought i could move on with my life i was wrong
2815448 of all tyrannies a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive it may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies the robber barons cruelty may sometimes sleep his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience

2815456 if youre not sure suggest more stability tell them to get a bigger size it will make you sound knowledgeable
2815457 if i was sure i actually gave her a credit card
2815458 in fact if you really want to know i thought it was going to be trendy crowded pretentious and full of itself i thought the staff would be snobby the place would be packed service would be awful prices high and food mediocre
2815459 this mexican joint went far beyond some customize able homemade gaucamole and a good margarita the food was exceptional
2815460 maybe its five stars because my girl friend and i had a great time
2815461 we dont have a signature dish here but if we did this would be it

2815468 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2815469 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2815470 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2815471 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2815472 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2815473 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal

2815505 the 3rd sun had unexpected and awful weather after hopes had been raised for change the whole predicted weather system has now changed completely for the next few days
2815506 it makes me very angry that gay activists who know nothing about china and dont even live here report that the chinese government is trying to stamp out gay culture its misrepresentation our club was raided but it was raided because the government had a directive against large crowds in open spaces they are worried about crowd control and fire regulations yes they might close us for the olympics but then they might close all nightclubs

2815529 so your telling me your some kind of god of stars
2815530 wait isnt cloud nine that cloud where all your dreams come true

2815538 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2815539 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2815540 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2815541 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2815542 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2815543 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2815544 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2815545 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2815546 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2815547 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2815548 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2815549 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2815550 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2815551 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2815552 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2815553 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2815554 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2815555 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2815556 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2815557 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2815558 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2815559 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2815560 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2815561 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2815562 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2815563 if i am not able to amuse myself there so at least i will learn some greek words
2815564 i will never be back to greece never i promise
2815565 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2815566 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2815567 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2815568 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2815569 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2815570 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2815571 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2815572 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2815573 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2815574 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2815575 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2815576 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2815577 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2815578 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2815579 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2815580 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2815581 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2815582 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2815583 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2815584 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2815585 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2815586 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2815587 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2815588 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2815589 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2815590 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2815591 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2815592 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2815593 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2815594 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2815595 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2815596 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2815597 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2815598 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2815599 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2815600 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2815601 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2815602 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2815603 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2815604 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2815605 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2815606 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2815607 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2815608 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2815609 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2815610 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2815611 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2815612 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2815613 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2815614 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2815615 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2815616 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2815617 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2815618 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2815619 just so you all know we did set a record
2815620 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2815621 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2815622 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2815623 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2815624 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2815625 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2815626 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2815627 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2815628 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2815629 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2815630 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2815631 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2815632 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2815633 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2815634 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2815635 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2815636 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2815637 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2815638 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2815639 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2815640 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2815641 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2815642 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2815643 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2815644 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2815645 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2815646 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2815647 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2815648 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2815649 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2815650 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2815651 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2815652 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2815653 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2815654 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2815655 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2815656 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2815657 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2815658 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2815659 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2815660 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2815661 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2815662 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2815663 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2815664 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2815665 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2815666 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2815667 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2815668 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2815669 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2815670 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2815671 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2815672 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2815673 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2815674 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2815675 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2815676 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2815677 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2815678 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2815679 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2815680 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2815681 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2815682 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2815683 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2815684 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2815685 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2815686 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2815687 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2815688 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2815689 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2815690 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2815691 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2815692 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2815693 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2815694 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2815695 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2815696 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2815697 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2815698 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2815699 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2815700 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2815701 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2815702 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2815703 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2815704 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2815705 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2815706 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2815707 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2815708 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2815709 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2815710 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2815711 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2815712 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2815713 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2815714 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2815715 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2815716 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2815717 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2815718 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2815719 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2815720 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2815721 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2815722 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2815723 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2815724 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2815725 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2815726 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2815727 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2815728 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2815729 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2815730 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2815731 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2815732 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2815733 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2815734 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2815735 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2815736 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2815737 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2815738 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2815739 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2815740 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2815741 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2815742 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2815743 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2815744 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2815745 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2815746 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2815747 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2815748 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2815749 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2815750 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2815751 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2815752 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2815753 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2815754 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2815755 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2815756 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2815757 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2815758 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2815759 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2815760 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2815761 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2815762 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2815763 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2815764 i shall expect a chemical cure for psychopathic behavior by 10 a m tomorrow or ill have your guts for spaghetti
2815765 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2815766 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2815767 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2815768 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2815769 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2815770 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2815771 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2815772 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2815773 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2815774 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2815775 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2815776 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2815777 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2815778 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2815779 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2815780 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2815781 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2815782 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2815783 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2815784 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2815785 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2815786 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2815787 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2815788 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2815789 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2815790 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2815791 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2815792 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2815793 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2815794 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2815795 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2815796 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2815797 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2815798 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2815799 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2815800 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2815801 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2815802 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2815803 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2815804 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2815805 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2815806 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2815807 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2815808 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2815809 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different
2815810 i think they knew that history was being made tonight
2815811 obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
2815812 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy
2815813 im kind of glad its out of the way now this game was just over the top
2815814 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you and so go out there and kick some butt
2815815 so i think that it will be good for us
2815816 you just had to smile because you couldnt write it any better
2815817 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2815818 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2815819 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2815820 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2815821 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2815822 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2815823 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2815824 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2815825 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2815826 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2815827 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2815828 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2815829 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2815830 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2815831 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2815832 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2815833 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2815834 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2815835 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2815836 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2815837 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2815838 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2815839 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2815840 this year to date from january to july we are actually down from last years accidents of 42
2815841 thats inclusive of minor crashes injury crashes and fatality crashes we were at 42 and are down 12 accidents
2815842 the overall amount of time people spend driving is lessened which definitely would attribute to that factor
2815843 less dollars spent tax dollar wise and definitely affects insurance rates to some degree
2815844 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2815845 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2815846 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2815847 crowds are very receptive here we didnt have to prompt them to mosh they took care of it for us
2815848 joyside its in germany and brain failure good for them its in the us
2815849 on the whole the quality of care is excellent the risks i have outlined here are around how do we manage and pick up when quality does fail or when theres abuse of older people
2815850 some of the lowest paid workers in the whole sector but when we look at what they do it is really important

2816021 have been postulated to play a very important role in neurocommunication but in this field essentially no critical studies have been performed to address this issue
2816022 so i set up an experiment to create an animal model in which a particular group of neurons in the brain couldnt release a small neurotransmitter and by examining those animal models i could know the function of those molecules
2816023 we found that the mice without gaba release from agrp neurons have increased energy expenditure and are resistant to diet induced obesity
2816024 the function of agrp neurons is probably to reserve the energy for maintaining life
2816025 so if the animal doesnt have enough food the animal should have some strategy to preserve energy and this group of neurons by releasing gaba restrains energy expenditure to maintain enough energy to survive under the conditions in which food is not readily available
2816026 i think it makes the role of gaba in obesity much more relevant than previously thought

2816041 in general threshold deals with 250 evictions a year and certainly in 2008 that figure will be significantly higher
2816042 the downturn in the economy has affected people living in the private rental sector and the number of illegal evictions
2816043 where as landlords in the past are more forgiving of tenants if they get into rent arrears what we are noticing now is that a tenant who gets into a weeks arrears or a months arrears that the landlords are moving very swiftly against them
2816044 they are not even willing to use the legal mechanisms there
2816045 the reason that some landlords do that is because they themselves are struggling to pay their mortgage

2816056 the present position taken by the west is a disappointment yet again in the present situation the west missed an opportunity to prove that they have moved beyond the clich s the double standards and the subjectivity of the recent past
2816057 strangely the voice of the west was silent and muted in the first hours of the invasion of south ossetia and then as if on command certain countries started to engage in criticism and tried to actually obstruct the efforts of the russian forces to compel the invader to stand down bringing into question their purpose methods and motives
2816058 this brings up very serious questions concerning their sincerity in their relations with us and we shall bear this in mind when we carry on discussions and negotiations dealing with world order
2816059 naturally our reaction is negative i am convinced that we shall say such in the telephone conversation now going on between foreign minister lavrov and condoleezza rice
2816060 we have had many contacts with the americans lately however a statement is a statement and we are going to give an official answer to it
2816061 we can end this crisis quickly if the usa and russia come to an understanding someone must bring georgian president mikhail saakashvili under control
2816062 we would like to see not only pictures of russian tanks reports about the advance of russian troops into south ossetia and the fact that russia is at war with georgia on western television screens they should also show the suffering of the ossetian people the bodies of the dead old people and children the devastated villages and the ruins of tskhinvali which is destroyed almost to the last time this would be an objective presentation of the evidence anything is nothing but political manipulation of the facts
2816063 the international community must put pressure on georgia so that it would withdraw its forces to the positions that were occupied on 6 august and that it would honour its obligations concerning the renunciation of force only after this shall it be possible to begin contacts and negotiations which undoubtedly shall be extremely complicated
2816064 without delay and unconditionally introduce a ceasefire in the caucasus
2816065 russia is a combatant not a mediator and this must be reflected at the moment we begin ceasefire negotiations for an armistice
2816066 it is difficult for me to judge mr shtubbs position based on this statement
2816067 provide supervision for the maintenance of the ceasefire and the withdrawal of military units this is precisely what the osce must demand from the georgian side it must completely and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the conflict zone and immediately sign a legally binding non aggression agreement

2816432 our first goal must be to free the county of the light flimsy throw away type of bag as given away by most major supermarkets these are the ones that spoil our hedgerows and pose a threat to wildlife where the public use the heavier plastic bags i urge them to reuse the bags as often as possible we are committed to making suffolk plastic bag free

2816443 we want to supply market traders with branded reusable bags that will do two things promote our market but also promote reusable bags we hope to bring it in by the end of this year
2816444 quite a few of the shops in the town are taking the initiative and are already offering re useable jute and hessian bags
2816445 we have really looked to the supermarkets for them to do their bit and to an extent they have we would all like to see less plastic bags and it is really down to the individual to economise and reuse bags

2816688 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2816689 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2816690 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2816691 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2816692 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2816693 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2816694 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

2816702 i came to the conclusion that bruno is not quite as far down the road back as id thought
2816703 my article was intended to be a celebration of the human spirit
2816704 but his thoughts show that although bruno has undoubtedly come a long way and deserves a huge amount of credit for that the former fighter may never again be the frank bruno we all came to know and love in the eighties and early nineties
2816705 if one thing screamsat me from this enlightening and at times uncomfortable interview it is that sad realisation
2816706 frank has said he is very sorry that this has happened
2816707 i could not really believe it when i heard he was ok i asked to speak to him first to make sure i felt so relieved that he was ok

2816716 this is happening all over the country wherever we can measure it in blue red and purple states

2816775 regrettably the answer is that we didnt find any decrease of thick melanoma over the last decade
2816776 there was the possibility that early detection and greater public awareness may have had an impact on later development of thick melanoma but so far that is not the case
2816777 the problem is that it is often quite difficult to identify thick melanomas early on they tend to have a nodular shape but dont necessarily stick out above the surrounding skin or have an irregular edge theyre not always dark either and can be quite pale and flat
2816778 hes sorely missed by the players and coaches and myself
2816779 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think he should be doing and having him saying i dont think so rather than where i am right now
2816780 taking a moment to let him know that were thinking about him
2816781 they were not going to start without us we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts before we started this journey
2816782 he just told us it will be difficult but together were going to be much stronger
2816783 we were given horrific news about someone we love and care about whose family was attacked our knee jerk reactions were like any other human beings would be we were angry as a male team we tend to hide our feelings a lot but there was definitely a moment when guys let off how they felt about the things
2816784 you cant live in fear or anger all you can do is send your prayers and sympathies to the family and try to continue what hugh would want us to do win a gold medal

2816814 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2816815 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2816816 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2816817 its a relief to us but its a give back to all the people who supported us because they were great
2816818 i feel like it hasnt hit me yet were home and we dont have to move weve moved four times
2816819 i was all settled in the nursing home kids were happy trying to get me in for awhile i came down here and i said im going home
2816820 its a psychological thing im never gonna get rid of but this helps
2816821 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2816822 we are a family and well get through this together as a family

2816827 and there were no nails in the feet of christ on that cross
2816828 especially in the years after bishop sheen had retired as bishop of rochester new york he crisscrossed morris county often and had a great affection for this part of the country
2816829 the vatican was impressed with the thorough organized work of the sheen foundation
2816830 in rome they like seals and we had the best wax seals too a canonization process can take five years or 500 years but i am here to tell you there is excitement in the city of rome for the fulton sheen cause
2816831 he said in a catholic college they would dissect their religion but in a non catholic college they would defend their religion
2816832 when you looked into his eyes and he talked you couldnt help but be moved
2816833 each of his tv shows addressed a different topic such as jealousy kindness love and devotion
2816834 individuals could be much wiser if they prayed to their angels
2816835 why worry about keeping up with the joneses keep up with the angels
2816836 when bishop sheen spoke people of different intelligences and ages understood him
2816837 he wanted the average person to understand there isnt so much mystery as there is an overabundance of gods love he had a common touch and a special devotion to the children of the new york foundling where he would spend an afternoon whenever he could he would beg them to tell him what their needs were

2816839 ich bin soldat und habe kein problem mit solchen aufnahmen

2816843 sicher muss es einen vern nftigen anschluss an den gro flughafen bbi geben aber das muss nicht durch eine autobahn geschehen
2816844 eine autobahn dort wird kein aush ngeschild berlins im gegenteil sie wird den stadtteil unattraktiver und weniger lebenswert machen

2816851 is now home to anyone who has a gripe with the catholic church
2816852 there are red button issues and im daring enough to touch them if youre sexist or homophobic you will passionately hate my vision
2816853 the roman catholic family can be described today as dysfunctional toxic or abusive
2816854 for decades we have allowed the men who claim to be our shepherds to abuse us
2816855 theyre concerned about the path of the church and where hes leading them
2816856 a lot of the old parishioners dont consider the new ones parishioners at all
2816857 our fight was about property but never about religion the people who have come here since then are here for different reasons where are they taking this church
2816858 theres a group of parishioners who have been there a long time and who dont like change
2816859 they are not very fond of us who are not polish
2816860 to break the rules important to them but not stand up for the ideals and beliefs he has himself
2816861 if you hire someone who doesnt follow along the dotted line
2816862 you cant expect him to follow it when you want him to
2816863 i think its worth it to keep him there because who else are we going to get as a priest
2816864 we dont have six other priests knocking on our door asking to get in there
2816865 we need food to eat cars to drive places to live
2816866 no one has an ambition to create a new denomination
2816867 my vision is to be roman catholic and wait for the regime to collapse
2816868 if the hypothetical happens and if the people elect a bishop and thats the way it should be done then whomever is asked by the people to be bishop should do it
2816869 hemos visto un caso de una persona de nacionalidad cubana votando marcando una papeleta con uno de esos carnet falsos que se han hecho

2816874 lots of farcical wedding related hijinks just like four weddings and a funeral
2816875 im not thinking of it too much like i want another number one because it dont really work like that the charts are really unpredictable
2816876 all you can hope for is to have a hit that grabs the attention of everyone like that song does

2816889 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
2816890 every soldier and officer should absolutely disobey any order to kill muslims or aid their killers
2816891 no hay dudas de que debemos tener el objetivo de limitar los cambios en la temperatura superficial media global de 2 c por encima del nivel preindustrial
2816892 pero dado que ste es un objetivo ambicioso y no sabemos en detalles como limitar las emisiones de gases invernadero para conseguir el objetivo de los dos grados deber amos estar preparados para adaptarnos a 4 c
2816893 mi percepci n es que si llegamos al aumento de los 4 grados es muy posible que comenz ramos a ver un incremento sin control
2816894 ning n otro factor centra las mentes del gabinete m s que el an lisis que hice comenzamos a hablar sobre la retirada ordenada de algunas reas de inglaterra porque se convierten en imposibles de defender
2816895 no hay elecci n entre adaptaci n y mitigaci n tenemos que hacer las dos
2816896 a 4 c estamos b sicamente en un r gimen clim tico diferentes
2816897 creo que es estar en una perspectiva peligrosa pensando sobre las implicaciones de 4 grados de calentamiento muestra que los impactos son tan significativos que la nica estrategia de adaptaci n real es evitarlo a cualquier precio porque va costar dolor y sufrimiento
2816898 no hay ciencia sobre como vamos a adaptarnos a un calentamiento de 4 grados de calentamiento es realmente muy alarmante
2816899 esto permitir a centrales t rmicas de carbono que se est n construyendo actualmente fueran modulares y capaces de modernizar la captura de carbono y mostrar an al mundo que nos tomamos el asunto del cambio clim tico seriamente de este modo demostramos un liderazgo real sin esta tecnolog a tenemos un problema real

2816904 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2816905 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2816906 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2816907 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2816908 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2816909 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2816910 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2816911 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2816923 try keeping a notebook every time you feel distracted or have a bad feeling stop what youre doing write it down and then let it go and get back to work then at the end of the day spend time reading it all and you can worry about it all then rather than worrying during the day ok times up how about next friday at 9
2816924 i was therefore rather surprised to be slammed against the side of the van by two officers and then to be looking directly at the front end of a taser gun
2816925 i cant wait to come down there and do a show for free as high as gas is
2816926 thats cool ill pay for my own hotel room its nuthin
2816927 why so he can tell dem erie ave and 22nd and lehigh ass niggas to put ya dick in the dirt when you tell him you aint got his money
2816928 thats messed up you aint come man everybody was here waitin for you you made me look fucked up you made ya self look fucked up
2816929 i guess im not as bad as i thought i have all my teeth and my sobriety
2816930 we will hit those points in a few years and that will help in many ways
2816931 we just have to survive through this part of the cycle
2816932 more delinquencies look like they are on the horizon because so few of them have reset
2816933 the wave on the prime side has lagged the wave on the subprime side
2816934 its a tremendous amount of money out of peoples pockets
2816935 people can cut back on heating to some extent if it gets too expensive but theres obviously a floor beyond which they cant go to keep themselves in their homes without freezing
2816936 maybe the people who are very very wealthy wont bat an eyelash but for the regular people who are working from paycheck to paycheck and week to week and dont have anything in the bank account this is devastating
2816937 people ask me how do you get by i sacrifice a lot of stuff
2816938 i dont drink i dont smoke i dont go out
2816939 any type of increase in cost especially of this magnitude is just going to make life so precarious so difficult perhaps even unlivable unless we can subsidize those households so that they can make it
2816940 i cant even think about the next two winters its obviously a horror show in the making
2816941 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2816942 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2816943 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2816944 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2816945 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2816946 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2816947 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2816948 microsoft makers of most of the computer software in the world tried to kill it with words and intel maker of most computer chips tried to kill it with dirty tricks of course they dont admit to being attempted murderers and when i introduce you to intels lovely spokesperson agnes kwan youll realise how far their denials go but the truth is the two mightiest high tech companies in the world looked on negropontes philanthropic scheme and decided it had to die
2816949 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2816950 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2816951 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2816952 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that

2816957 all the gold that leaves our village is headed to mali to this one man
2816958 he has the means to take it out we dont
2816959 for a long time hes worked with the white people
2816960 we dont live in the bush so we have nothing to do with child labor
2816961 i can assure you that what he declares is only a fraction of what is going out
2816962 if i am wrong you can cut off my head and put it on a platter
2816963 i buy some grams some kilos from here and there
2816964 service or even accept gold from a mine where children work
2816965 it comes from africa and it arrives in the swiss banks thats all you need to know
2816966 there is a desire to deal with this but the question is how
2816967 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
2816968 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
2816969 if i have one wish its that i might someday have a little bit of money
2816970 sometimes i dream that one day ill own something made of gold
2816971 ahora ya eres grande hijo m o deja de fantasear
2816972 il tuo sguardo un misto di velata tristezza e forte rancore per questo la gente non ti guarda spesso negli occhi ha paura di questo
2816973 meglio essere solo come un cane piuttosto che stare con quei cani l fuori
2816974 non metta il punto vicino alle parole master mi ricorda celes
2816975 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
2816976 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2816977 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia

2816984 do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves i am the lord
2816985 hambly concluded that historically tattooing had originated in connection with ancient rites of scarification and bloodletting which were associated with religious practices in harmony with supernatural forces and ensure continuity between this life and the next
2816986 so people should be allowed to die in excruciating pain while elective abortions are free
2816987 so i should have to come up with the money to pay for treatment of a very painful and potentially fatal condition that landed on me out of the blue while paying taxes to provide money for tramps like you to be carelessly sexually active
2816988 the district courts decision basically denied civil liberties and denied the first amendment
2816989 we are going to end up looking like animals locked up in a cage they claim that the delegates will be able to walk by us and interact with them but they are going to be afraid to come near us

2816999 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2817000 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2817001 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2817002 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
2817003 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough

2817020 el fen meno de la pesca ilegal es grande pero tambi n es cierto que se ha avanzado mucho en 2000 las actividades ilegales en la zona de do ana eran muy superiores
2817021 existen mecanismos de control v a sat lite que indica la posici n del barco cada tres minutos lo que permite ser usado para el levantamiento de actas de infracci n
2817022 s lo con la persecuci n no se puede acabar con el problema por eso intentamos realizar una labor de concienciaci n entre los primeros interesados que deben ser los propios pescadores pues de ellos depende en gran parte su propio futuro en la zona de do ana esto se da especialmente pero es importante en toda la costa andaluza

2817026 it is not possible to rescue the stranded people at night as the weather is bad and there is no light so they will be moved only after dawn on monday
2817027 food and water has been provided to the people and officials are there to help people have been kept in rough shelters
2817028 most of the stranded people are shiva devotees from nearby areas who had come during the auspicious month of shravan
2817029 hes quickly developed into a team favorite just with his presence and how he goes about his business
2817030 hes a true professional and you like that to come back from an injury like he has and what hes done for our ballclub hes a true big leaguer and you respect that
2817031 hes a special guy and he works so hard at it
2817032 hes so mentally strong hes doing great he never had a hiccup in recovery he never had that thing where he had to back off for anything he blew right through it
2817033 i dont blame him at all if i had to do it again id do it again
2817034 if it was going to happen it was going to happen
2817035 it kind of crossed my mind and i laughed it off
2817036 i said its not going to happen again its fixed and im good to go i just kind of laughed it off i guess
2817037 i got in shape the best shape of my life
2817038 i talk to guys on other teams guys who are pretty legitimate guys on other teams and they tell you hes a pretty good pitcher ive faced him too before and hes not a walk in the park even when he was coming up
2817039 i came back early too but im not a pitcher
2817040 to come back the first couple of months i had to swing the bat which is totally different from pitching from spring training until now to see what hes done youve got to scratch your head
2817041 you know hes worked really hard to get there hes earned a lot of respect from guys just with his work ethic and the way he approaches the game the four days in between starts you barely know hes here he run into him and hes working it seems like hes passing through the clubhouse going to do something and when he takes the mound hes a huge presence for us out there
2817042 i think today was one of those must win games and it was nice to pull this one out
2817043 obviously we would have liked to have done better its obviously a three team race right now you dont want to get too far behind is it a wash i guess it is
2817044 its probably going to go down to the end i dont see us giving in i dont see those two teams giving in

2817053 theyre not just good hockey players theyre good kids too
2817054 i was quite excited to be invited to the camp and to make the team just to be here and play for your country its an amazing experience
2817055 in north america you really go to the net hard and coaches preach that from a young age
2817056 crashing the net going to the net staying in on rebounds
2817057 here any type of contact with a goaltender as slight as it may be results in a penalty its just a little bit different mindset
2817058 the nationals are certainly pitching our election campaign at the votes of regional west australians and we wish to use preference negotiations to influence the liberal party to support our plan
2817059 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2817060 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2817061 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2817062 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2817063 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2817064 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2817065 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2817066 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the
2817067 hm hm irc s ger du satt du n got p undernet mellan 98 och 01 isf finns det risk
2817068 well written det ska var lustfyllt och det g r rykten om att vissa i sugkretsarna k nner ett litet sug
2817069 jocke fast jag har f r mig att jag har h rt n got liknande tidigare fast allt har v l redan
2817070 wow det var ett fint citat vem ligger bakom det eller kom du p det sj lv nu allts det
2817071 pero no s por qu exactamente se dec a que fue porque ac hab a gente a la que le molestaba lo que hac an y porque alentaban a que los alojados se quejen
2817072 los echaron como perros les dijeron que no quer an que pisen m s ac los chicos eran buen simos los que mejor nos ayudaban ac se preocupaban por lo chicos y por los grandes es muy injusto lo que les hicieron nadie les explic nada ac hay muchas cuestiones pol ticas y ellos ven an sin ning n inter s queremos que vuelvan
2817073 les tra an juguetes de sus casas y ayudaban a que los chicos est n mejor porque est n pasando por un muy mal momento tambi n
2817074 los chicos compraron una garrafa con plata de su bolsillo eran j venes que podr an haber estado en su casa o saliendo con sus amigos pero estaban ac ayudando
2817075 ac hab a evacuados que ten an colchones y los vend an ahora se fueron como yo no ten a para mis hijos les tuve que comprar uno ac tambi n vino la gente de tn canal de la capital y un hombre pelado de anteojos de la municipalidad se acerc y nos dijo que digamos que ten amos de todo que nos est n atendiendo bien y que no nos quejemos porque nos echaban
2817076 el plan de incontinencia funcion a la perfecci n se cagaron en todo
2817077 con este acto buscamos se alar en nuestra ciudad a uno de los principales responsables pol ticos de la inundaci n porque sino este tipo por balbarrey va a seguir caminando por la calle como si nada y encima pretende ser reelecto como intendente
2817078 es posible con la justicia que tenemos que balbarrey nunca sea condenado
2817079 frente a la inundaci n en diversos sitios del norte del pa s y las lluvias record el intendente y sus secuaces nos hablaban de un supuesto plan de contingencia que se activar a ante cualquier emergencia pero finalmente ocurri lo que se tem a el agua empez a anegar numerosos barrios de la ciudad especialmente los del cord n oeste y dicho sea de paso una vez m s el oeste no mereci la atenci n de nuestros gobernantes
2817080 pero no conformes con esto intentan instalar una falsa realidad de la normalizaci n de la ciudad inconcebible si tenemos en cuenta los 30 mil evacuados que hubo y los que todav a hay
2817081 se pretende minimizar la situaci n atribuy ndola exclusivamente a un fen meno meteorol gico por eso vinimos a decirle a balbarrey que es un inundador esta inundaci n no fue fruto del clima sino de la desidia y la inoperancia de los gobiernos provincial y municipal vinimos a decirle que nos parece despreciable que mientras se inundaba la ciudad l negociara su candidatura por todo esto exigimos juicio pol tico para los inundadores
2817082 se trata de cubrir desde el mbito legislativo la situaci n de emergencia que ya vienen atendiendo los gobiernos nacional y locales desde los primeros evacuados que se registraron
2817083 declara una urgencia por eso me hago eco de esa urgencia
2817084 el mismo tratamiento a los distritos del norte bonaerense que el que se pide para los habitantes de santa fe y entre r os
2817085 nos insultaron y nos dijeron que si no nos gustaba que nos fu ramos
2817086 porque se enteraron de que en el predio ferial estaban entregando ropa
2817087 todo lo que pedimos a promoci n comunitaria se entreg
2817088 la gente que vio lo que pas se enoj mucho
2817089 estuvieron desde el momento en que se abri el centro
2817090 durante los primeros d as hicimos distintos tipos de comidas con el objetivo de que lleguen todas calientes y que tengan un contenido cal rico importante tal vez no es lo m s rico pero son las que ayudan a la gente que estaba mojada y con fr o a mantenerse y recuperar energ a
2817091 y ahora vamos a empezar a mimarlos un poco m s con las comidas pero en los primeros d as la prioridad era que reciban algo caliente
2817092 es una de las comidas m s nutritivas porque tiene carne verduras y cereales y cubre los requerimientos de hidratos de carbonos prote nas minerales y vitaminas
2817093 las demoras se produjeron porque hay lugares que est n lejos y por ejemplo a alto verde tenemos que llegar en lancha a esto se sumaron los piquetes que en algunos casos demoraron la llegada de los camiones con comida
2817094 a veces nos falta gente para el reparto si bien trabajamos con nuestro grupo de gente habitual hay muchos que no pudieron llegar porque tambi n estaban inundados por la falta de personal al principio no pod amos llegar a horario porque no ten amos gente que movilizara la cantidad de mercader a sin polic as no se puede salir porque muchas veces han querido interceptar a los camiones
2817095 yo no digo que ustedes busquen un r dito pol tico a partir de plantear qui nes son los responsables
2817096 ataques vand licos contra la fachada del edificio municipal el pasado 5 de abril
2817097 nos juntamos y se manej la posibilidad de salir a defender p blicamente a balbarrey que es mi amigo pero no se habl de hacerlo a trav s de una solicitada
2817098 s muchos de ellos estuvimos reunidos el martes por la noche ah aparece el senador armando traferri su esposa m nica de la quintana intendenta de san lorenzo y un grupo de dirigentes departamentales pero que yo sepa no hablamos de una solicitada
2817099 no voy a hacer declaraciones p blicas sobre el tema pero lo autorizo a transmitir que no firm nada que no se me consult al respecto y que resolver esto que ha sucedido puertas adentro de mi partido yo tengo muchas cr ticas sobre el manejo que hicieron los gobiernos de santa fe y de rosario de la emergencia pero no me parece el momento de hacerlas
2817100 no quiero hablar de casos puntuales nosotros lo que vemos en la provincia de santa fe es que de parte del estado faltan un mont n de obras pero el problema es m s amplio ac el problema de la gente centralmente y de los inundados es ver c mo entre todos podemos resolver las problem ticas en esto somos responsables todos y nos acordamos de los responsables en el momento en que los inundados est n padeciendo a m lo que me gustar a es que los t cnicos antes de que sucedan los hechos salgan a decir la problem tica que existe y as entre todos mejorar amos los problemas
2817101 nos fuimos por la gente que est ah evacuada no quer amos que se generen situaciones violentas dentro del predio
2817102 somos estudiantes trabajadores militantes de agrupaciones estudiantiles independientes ciudadanos somos voluntarios del centro de evacuados del predio ferial municipal no nos paga nadie no nos manda nadie no estamos en una disputa partidaria no perseguimos r ditos electorales
2817103 en el predio ferial municipal desde el primer momento las autoridades no se hicieron presentes no se dispuso personal id neo ni suficiente para organizar las actividades quienes suplieron esta ausencia fuimos los voluntarios y las personas evacuadas en el lugar logrando un importante grado de participaci n organizaci n y solidaridad
2817104 esta incipiente organizaci n no se limit a mejorar las condiciones de habitabilidad con los escasos recursos materiales que prove an los gobiernos municipal provincial y nacional sino que tambi n procur mediante diferentes medios que asumiesen su responsabilidad quienes deb an hacerlo ante las m ltiples respuestas negativas los voluntarios salimos a conseguir estos recursos adem s se recurri a los medios de comunicaci n para poner en conocimiento al resto de la ciudadan a las condiciones de desatenci n en las que se encontraban los vecinos evacuados
2817105 nuestro trabajo y organizaci n molest a las autoridades que comenzaron a tener una presencia mayor en el lugar s lo con la intenci n de salir al cruce de nuestro accionar y ocultar su inoperancia en el conflicto s lo as se puso a trabajar el municipio que hasta ahora no se encontraba por ninguna parte de la ciudad y menos a n en el predio a medida que avanzaba el tiempo iba aumentando la cantidad de personas vinculada al municipio y con ello la hostilidad para con nosotros y los evacuados
2817106 cabe destacar que la inserci n fue progresiva muchos lo hicieron en car cter de autoridad pero otros se hicieron pasar por voluntarios tratando de desarticular el trabajo realizado nos echaron del lugar y no respetaron la decisi n de los evacuados de auto organizarse haci ndolos rehenes de una disputa electoral de la cual no somos ni nos interesa ser part cipes
2817107 los violentos son los que generan la discriminaci n y la marginaci n los que mienten y se hacen los sorprendidos apelamos a la sociedad a romper con el aislamiento y la mentira sistem tica generada en torno de la situaci n tambi n pedimos acompa ar en el d a despu s esto no termina ac falta a n la vuelta a casa

2817191 market forces are dictating that the face of marketing changes to meet the needs of the enterprise in our experience these changes are being driven by three main forces namely increased marketing complexity increased demand for marketing accountability and a major power shift to customers
2817192 it is with this that senior marketing executives and business need to reinvent their business models centring these on the customer but this is not something that has to be done in the dark the reality is that there are technologies in the industry that can assist marketers in making better and smarter decisions that will have a positive impact on their customers

2817231 the 6th world archaeological congress expresses its strong opposition to any unilateral and unprovoked covert or overt military action including air strikes against iran by the us government or by any other government such action will have catastrophic consequences for millions of people and will seriously endanger the cultural heritage of iran and of the middle east in general any differences with iran as with any other country should be resolved through peaceful and diplomatic means the congress also urges its members all archaeologists and heritage professionals to resist any attempts by the military and governments to be co opted in any planned military operation for example by providing advice and expertise to the military on archaeological and cultural heritage matters such advice would provide cultural credibility and respectability to the military action archaeologists should continue emphasising instead the detrimental consequences of such actions for the people and the heritage of the area for the past and the present alike a universal refusal by archaeologists and others would send the message that such a plan is hugely unpopular amongst cultural professionals as well as the wider public

2817234 the aggregation industry is commoditised and there is very little scope to differentiate therefore its important to add value where at all possible the new ad unit continues zamanos strategy to offer an end to end solution for partners that complements its existing offering of a mobile white label solution comprising billing content management services and powerful reporting tools
2817235 its easy to see why the local authorities would be so intrigued by sms as a communications tool virtually all of their constituents use sms regularly so its familiar to them also because the mobile is so ubiquitous it means people can respond spontaneously to issues that affect them such as non urgent complaints about low level crime and in these environmentally aware days text alerts beat paper hand outs every time
2817236 a key element in zamanos strategy has been to take advantage of consolidation opportunities within the mobile space eirborne will be an excellent addition to zamano both through top and bottom line improvements as well as delivering on our stated ambition to enter the web space with an emphasis on building continuity between the fixed line internet and mobile internet eirbornes brands have demonstrated substantial user growth in the last six months and are firmly established amongst the target youth demographics in the uk irish and australian markets they are thus highly complimentary to the existing zamano brands
2817237 the acquisition of eirborne is zamanos first deal post listing on aim and iex and will provide zamano with an enhanced web presence and brand propositions which are aligned to our target users in our core geographic markets the acquisition also marks an important milestone in our strategic development and we will continue to focus on driving growth and investor value through further strategic acquisitions investment in new technologies and expansion into new territories
2817238 we are delighted with this opportunity to extend the reach of our mobile entertainment services via the zamano network we have worked with the zamano team for a number of years now and we are confident that the two businesses together will create market leading offerings for the mobile community

2817309 may be said to be the posture of extremes within islam the aims and goals of the radical revisionist are that of the traditionalist nevertheless radical and extreme measures like
2817310 posture or islamic left seeks to adapt and contextualize islam to the modern world this is a posture of syncretism which is not averse to stripping islam down to bare universal principles in order to bring it into harmony with the modern world
2817311 when we begin to look more closely however the boundaries between the categories blur modernist and revivalist for example begin to look a lot like each other and sometimes the characteristics of the two styles seem to appear in a single person
2817312 there are as many islams as there are situations that sustain it
2817313 presumptions of muslim cultural homogeneity and continuity do not correspond to social reality
2817314 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2817315 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2817316 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2817317 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2817318 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2817319 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians

2817322 you can focus on the meeting and not the technology
2817323 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2817324 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2817325 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2817326 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2817327 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2817328 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2817329 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2817330 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2817331 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2817332 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2817333 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2817334 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2817335 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2817336 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2817337 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2817338 hey look at me i have a trophy or an award

2817343 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2817344 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2817345 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2817346 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2817347 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2817348 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2817349 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2817350 jose affects ninas change of heart through a hearty application of guilt and pity two particularly bad reasons for bringing children into this world
2817351 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2817352 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2817353 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2817354 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2817355 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2817356 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2817357 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2817358 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2817359 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2817360 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2817361 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2817362 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2817363 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2817364 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2817365 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2817366 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2817367 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2817368 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2817369 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2817370 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2817371 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2817372 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2817373 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2817374 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2817375 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2817376 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2817377 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2817378 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2817379 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2817380 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2817381 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2817382 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2817383 who are open to doing something on the production side
2817384 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2817385 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2817386 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2817387 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2817388 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2817389 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2817390 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2817391 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2817392 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2817393 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2817394 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2817395 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2817396 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2817397 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2817398 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2817399 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2817400 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2817401 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2817402 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2817403 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2817404 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2817405 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2817406 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2817407 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america

2817409 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2817410 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2817411 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

2817455 it is necessary to find out who is responsible at a very high international level and to bring them to a legitimate international court
2817456 suspects should be fingered out among those who gave orders and this should be thoroughly scrutinized and investigated
2817457 the one who gave orders on the night destruction of tskhinvali is naturally the main responsible person

2817512 no man should touch him or they will be severly punished
2817513 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2817514 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2817515 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2817516 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2817517 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2817518 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2817519 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2817520 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2817521 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2817522 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2817523 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2817524 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2817525 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2817526 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2817527 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2817528 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2817529 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2817530 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2817531 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2817532 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2817533 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2817534 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2817535 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2817536 blooms are silvery white in the heat and blush pink in cooler temperatures
2817537 you know helen and i were like this picking out drapes and tiles and then the next thing you know youre singing surry with the fringe on top in front of ira
2817538 hvis dere bare er to stykker eller flere som er enig om det dere ber om s skal dere f det
2817539 ok det det og det kan jeg kanskje gj re noe med men den der er for dr y den stryker vi av lista
2817540 this season even more than last season has been huge
2817541 we mightve had 200 people at shows before the hiatus and about 1 500 last year this year were seeing about 2 500 people theres probably not as many people going away for weeks at a time i mean with gas costs more people dont want to drive as much
2817542 for some reason it seems more important now than it ever was probably because the kids come with their kids but this year there has been a lot more people at first maybe it was because of the economy but since then its been because theres real good music
2817543 where else can you go and have such a good time for free
2817544 people are looking for community events that are free but theyre spending money in the local economy
2817545 our thursday night event attracts a little more of an after work cocktail crowd theyre spending money but theyre spending it locally
2817546 in memory of the naksa break the siege of gaza

2817548 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2817549 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2817550 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2817551 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins

2817558 i was thinking that if we each tally up the contributions we made individually that we could come up with a grand total divide that by 5 and then deduct what we put in and pay bella me accordingly what do you think
2817559 few artists have managed to capture the collision between past and present between histories and horror stories between sexuality and shame between skin and meat as powerfully and provocatively as kara walker 37
2817560 i really felt that terms such as installation art and site specific had lost their meaning and specificity through overuse anything presented in a gallery is both installed and site specific in the most general sense
2817561 it felt decidedly unnatural having the sum total of all human knowledge at your fingertips
2817562 the righteous man cares for the needs of his animal

2817589 i know senator obama has not been in the united states senate for that long but hes been there long enough to vote
2817590 and the irony here is that senator obama voted for the bush cheney energy policy that gave billions of dollars in subsidies to big oil now here his attacking senator mccain it was senator john mccain the maverick the independent hes his own guy goes down to the floor of the u s senate and on that same 2005 bush cheney energy bill voted against it john mccain puts country first he understands the most important thing we need to do is to protect americans fight for them we dont need to be subsidizing big oil we need to be fighting for the american people john mccain has a right senator obama just doesnt understand it and thats a shame

2817596 in none of the evidence presented did you ever see him brandishing a weapon at all
2817597 when he knows that he is in us hands and is realtively sure that no one is going to bring harm to him and his family
2817598 the general feeling is that the odds that this guy is going to go back after what has been publically reported about his cooperation even if he felt any inclination to go back which we dont think he did
2817599 the jury would be extremely annoyed if that happened after all what did we come down here for
2817600 it was set up as and is a clear legacy of the system of controlling slaves
2817601 i was down and he stamped on me i thought he could have avoided me there was no need for it
2817602 that was why i reacted and why i grabbed his leg
2817603 rio is now the best centre half in the world by far
2817604 that was an exemplary performance he did not give one foul away and intercepted every ball that came towards him
2817605 he broke out of defence in comfort so many times it was unbelievable he is a magnificent player
2817606 he is 30 now and because he has experience his potential is now being fulfilled in a big way
2817607 originally ryan did not want to be captain but he is comfortable with it now
2817608 but gary neville represents the heart of the club that is why i gave him it in the first place
2817609 i am sure we will find out in due course
2817610 of course it would be an honour but my main concern at the moment is manchester united
2817611 wes only missed two games last season and was absolutely outstanding
2817612 it is certainly a dilemma looking at it i dont think gary will play all the time if we get 35 games out of him i would be delighted so wes brown can do a job there
2817613 gary could play in a friendly that would not be a problem because he needs games
2817614 but i would like him to play a few with us before he got to that crucial moment when you get back into international football
2817615 gary had an hour today which was perfect for him
2817616 when you think about the length of time gary has been out for to come back the way he has is remarkable
2817617 it was just beyond imaginable words cant express how i felt playing out there it was just a great way to kick off the olympics for me for my teammates to get a win the way they did
2817618 first half was just jitters and anxiousness to get out there and get started
2817619 we knew it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams we just calmed down and played a lot better basketball

2817649 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2817650 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2817651 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2817652 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2817653 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2817865 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2817866 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2817867 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2817868 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2817869 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2817870 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2817871 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2817872 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2817873 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2817874 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2817875 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2817876 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2817877 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2817878 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2817879 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2817880 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2817881 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2817882 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2817883 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2817884 now we have an image of the structure were starting on the search for drug compounds in collaboration with australian pharmaceutical company that can block the receptor and prevent the wrong message going through
2817885 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2817886 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2817887 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2817888 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2817889 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2817890 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2817891 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2817892 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2817893 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2817894 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2817895 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2817896 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2817897 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2817898 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2817899 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

2817908 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2817909 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2817910 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2817911 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2817912 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2817913 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2817914 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2817915 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2817916 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2817917 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2817918 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2817919 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

2817922 i saw him at the immigration station he was really old looking he had sent a picture when he was 25 years old my heart stopped my cousin in honolulu had arranged the marriage and i was very angry at her i cried for 8 days in my room if i dont get married i have to go back my parents would be very shamed so i married him
2817923 when i see him he skinny and black i no like no look like picture but no can go home
2817924 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2817925 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2817926 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

2817928 our mom and dad were the only seoul people in this korean camp the other koreans looked up to them

2817931 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2817932 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

2817934 they appear to be hard workers yet they are paid the least would work ten hours from dawn to sunset for sixty nine cents a day
2817935 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2817936 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2817937 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2817938 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2817939 having a son was the ultimate to carry the chang name but there i came the third girl
2817940 i remember aunty katherine to be entertaining with an infectious laugh even today who kept us occupied during sleepovers with stories bean bag games and singing
2817941 when you think about it who can say what the most valuable life experience is but certainly there are few events in life more memorable than catching your first fish my first fish was on a bamboo pole in that stream in back of aunty katherine and uncle peters house uncle mito was there and devoted his entire day to helping us there must have been 8 kids set up our poles with bait and then unhook those ugly black fish
2817942 i remember phyllis was still in a crib when our mom started taking us out to waimalu to visit with aunty katherine and her family it started off as just day visits but eventually turned into over nighters back then waimalu was almost like going to the country no h 1 freeway back then
2817943 they had a fairly large house lot with a wide stream in their back yard and what looked like deepest darkest africa on the other side i remember us fishing along the stream banks catching native oopu fish maybe a hundred
2817944 the oopu are a native fish that migrates from mountain streams to the shoreline and back again sort of like salmon in fact the oopu is used as a symbol in the state of hawaii pictures of this fish are stenciled on storm drains to remind people not to dump hazardous materials into the storm drain
2817945 then im glad when we were kids uncle mito convinced us to return all those fish to the river to be caught again on another day
2817946 ok i guess well just have to ask you to sing a few bars at the next reunion
2817947 he is her perfect type she loves guys who work out and he is in great shape from his days serving in the israeli army
2817948 he also has a few tattoos which she loves theyve spent so much time together that one thing led to another and their relationship became physical
2817949 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2817950 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

2818039 hay un endurecimiento de las condiciones de cr dito y una revisi n de las perspectivas de crecimiento porque los mercados financieros y la econom a real funcionan como vasos comunicantes sigue habiendo miedo y ha habido episodios de p nico y nada de eso cambiar hasta que se restablezca la confianza en el sector financiero
2818040 han evitado un colapso financiero y en el fondo una ca da generalizada del pib y del empleo como sucedi en los a os treinta
2818041 el problema es que eso trae problemas de riesgo moral los bancos asumen riesgos a sabiendas de que el sector p blico los salvar si las cosas se tuercen y que al prevenir que la econom a toque fondo r pidamente la recuperaci n puede tomar mucho tiempo la recesi n no va a ser profunda pero la recuperaci n va a ser lenta
2818042 una de las lecciones que deja la crisis es que el sector financiero estaba infrarregulado y hay que cambiar eso
2818043 el banco de espa a ha sido un ejemplo en eso impidi que la banca espa ola se metiera donde no deb a
2818044 los pol ticos tienen tendencia a prepararse para la guerra que ya sucedi esta batalla ya se perdi la regulaci n tiene que mejorar pero el sistema financiero est especializado en buscarle las vueltas a las regulaciones con nuevos instrumentos pasada la crisis la banca volver a sorprender

2818060 the fed probably does not need to tighten interest rates now
2818061 that price increase did not cover the difference in our costs
2818062 we were hoping the price would come down and we could pass that reduction back to our customers
2818063 weve had frequent rain events and no persistent heat to affect yields so the crop is off to a decent start
2818064 but the questions remain will we have a long enough growing season since its been cooler than normal and how much of the crop was drowned out this spring
2818065 usually they are accurate to within about 5 percent of the crop estimate
2818066 its kind of like calling gasoline at 3 50 a gallon cheap
2818067 there was real concern about the asian crops and strong import demand from the philippines and people went into a panic mode over food security concerns
2818068 now the panic buying is out and importers are waiting for the crops from thailand and vietnam
2818069 maybe from its high the price is down 10 percent but weve seen price increases at the wholesale level of 40 percent to 50 percent since the beginning of the year the basic cost to build something is so much higher than six months ago

2818071 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders
2818072 if israel continues to oppose making this a reality then the palestinian demand for the palestinian people and its leadership would be one state a binational state
2818073 you know youll never be an olympic volleyball player if you dont learn to crawl
2818074 it was mostly ad libbed with russell asking her for advice about hosting the show
2818075 theres also a 9 000 pound elephant in it as in the elephant in the room
2818076 this scene went on for a long time like half the day and its getting old and i go over to sean and i guess he didnt know that i was wearing a prosthetic
2818077 i go sean youre such a great actor but you wouldnt do a scene like this if they asked you you wouldnt dive into a pool naked
2818078 and he said well james if i was built like you i would
2818079 a couple of weeks later we did this scene where were both dancing and were naked and we both have prosthetic penises he finally put it together that im wearing like the boogie nights prosthetic
2818080 it was a flying start it was lovely to see mahe out there dominating as he did but just everyone seeing caroline and georgina evers swindell out there enjoying it and rowing well was a real lift and a good solid start
2818081 you learn a lot watching your opposition play i guess both sides will be trying to get an edge and trying to get that edge tactically
2818082 the games changed a lot under these new laws and unless you get an advantage playing those new rules you are in trouble you need to think it out now a lot
2818083 we played the old laws for a long time and i guess it had become trying to perfect what you were doing there now its a whole new ball game
2818084 perhaps once everyone gets used to these rules it might be like the old ones but for us its our fifth game under these laws and its the same for the south african coaches
2818085 i think its a different level of fitness too its more of an aerobic fitness than explosive you still need explosiveness too but you need a better aerobic base
2818086 the balls in play a third of the time more than it was so guys have to run further in the same amount of time
2818087 there is a lot more kicking and catching and kicking into space and ensuring you kick when you are in the right positions so there is a lot more research into that sort of stuff for the coaches
2818088 it may be a more skilful game for 15 guys on the field in terms of them all being able to catch and pass and that sort of stuff
2818089 the gardens have eight gates of gold inlaid with jewels is
2818090 ist ihnen der leopard aufgefallen der neue passat cc wer ihn sieht sieht nichts anderes
2818091 die entwicklung der heutigen autos mit einem verbrennungsmotor als antrieb begann 1886 in deutschland carl benz erfand es am 3 juli 1886 in mannheim kurz danach folgten unabh ngig davon in cannstatt bei stuttgart gottlieb daimler und wilhelm maybach sowie siegfried marcus in wien

2818096 if you look directly across the street over at the 76 gas station intersection you have whats positioned there one of our mobile substations
2818097 for the first time we are such a diverse union at this point with cops firefighters teachers bus drivers waterworks people etc
2818098 its gonna be a good thing for guam if we can get that hospital built here
2818099 this law provides the framework to ensure our people and physicians are protected as we take advantage of the life saving technologies in the medical field that will greatly enhance cost savings for guams families
2818100 i think its very important as this government continues to move in the direction of increased revenues as a result of the growing economy that we use the additional revenues into the government to pay our past due obligations and reduce our deficit
2818101 activities such as poetry story telling oral arts or like chanting things of this nature that involve the language
2818102 we did make immediate assessments and also recommendations in ways to comply with the requirements of our regulatory agencies
2818103 what a great asset thank you for all your hard work and diligence
2818104 i like the fact that you show all races keep up the good work
2818105 in a medium that is usually muddled with lazy arguments and poor grammar your writing breaks through with a clarity that makes us all say
2818106 i read your site every day keeps me focused and honest
2818107 youre blog has inspired me to start my own thank you
2818108 wow great blog you have here keep up the good work

2818111 i love your blog one of the few very few i will read all the way
2818112 our compliments for your blog we like it a lot
2818113 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2818114 they seem to have gone beyond the logical stopping point
2818115 there will probably be guerilla warfare all over the country
2818116 but the russians are not letting them withdraw they are pursuing them and people are seeing this
2818117 this is not about military objectives this is about a political objective removing a thorn in their side
2818118 at midnight last night we got from the russians that they would welcome a call from saakashvili
2818119 he has asked to talk with putin and he has asked to talk to medvedev
2818120 i think a certain amount of tension is very healthy and a certain amount of different views
2818121 because of the bubble that a president is in and the bubble that a candidate is in sometimes you find out afterwards something that oh boy i wish i had heard thus and such and so and so so i appreciate and want some of the tension i dont want too much of it obviously because we have to have certain efficiencies but i think there is a balance there
2818122 senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
2818123 it is formally headed by steve and rick this is one of the things that has been improved
2818124 in such bad shape that they had to be grounded
2818125 soldiers are taught to expect the unexpected and accept it and revise improvise and fight their way through any adversity
2818126 but hes not a client who has much tolerance for sitting through an hour long presentation or 30 to 40 minute presentation of slides and charts
2818127 he did all the things you need to do to right the ship
2818128 there can be differences of thought but campaigns dont collapse because you have differences of opinion
2818129 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2818130 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2818131 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2818132 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2818133 this was a heinous attack by al qaeda in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2818134 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2818135 al qaeda is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2818136 and the gasoline for the crimes that we have will run out
2818137 i dont have an administrative assistant i dont have an inspector one major case can soak up my entire office and we have major cases all the time
2818138 build a tower with an armed guard every 100 yards
2818139 you see them with their ammunition belts and their ammunition boots you can see the dollies being rolled outside to their cars
2818140 why do they need the high powered guns because the mexican military is armed too and they need to pierce that armor
2818141 was going to somebody in mexico involved in some illegal activity drug trafficking alien smuggling perhaps or something else
2818142 a crook could care less how many laws you have
2818143 thats like holding a car manufacturer liable for traffic accidents
2818144 they had the necessary documents and an instant fbi check was approved
2818145 it started out by selling one of my personal guns and things went on from there
2818146 n o estamos sabendo disso e acho que o saber amos se fosseverdade
2818147 apesar de o duto estar parado por uma semana ou duas pouco prov vel que isto tenha muito efeito sobre a oferta mundial de petr leo
2818148 there was a time when i was the same way i wanted it all and i wanted it fast and no obstacle was big enough to put me off since then i had learned that some things were bigger than they looked from a distance and now i was not sure anymore just what i was going to get or even what i deserved i was not proud of what i had learned but i never doubted it was worth knowing
2818149 i was not proud of what i had learned but i never doubted it was worth knowing
2818150 en boycottant on va montrer la chine quon est contre son r gime
2818151 questo raggio fa s che chi lha visto non si possa pi ingannare nelle cose di sentimento la sua apparizione distrugge lillusione e le menzogne chi ha avuto la fortuna di vederlo una volta vede chiaro nel suo cuore e in quello degli altri
2818152 prime minister al maliki is extremely concerned by the evolution of differences between kurds and the arab and turkmen
2818153 there is no equal in military power kurdish forces are too large they would be able to impose total control over kirkuk in hours
2818154 barzani iraqi kurdish leader cannot annex kirkuk without the greenlight from washington and i think if the us does this they will lose the support and cooperation of the sunni arab forces in the governorates of al anbar baghdad salahuddin diyala and ninevah which will undermine any security improvements achieved by the us in iraq
2818155 all i can do is be me whoever that is
2818156 all i can do is be me whoever that is
2818157 its not every day you can say you topped the charts at the cup level
2818158 see i made certain way back then that i had invited jesus in theres no need to do it again
2818159 kept all these things and pondered them in her heart
2818160 of course i kind of have to go where my aunt and uncle go
2818161 im terrified theyll serve spaghetti or something and ill end up wearing it for the rest of the night
2818162 i know were all going up to the lake for boat rides
2818163 not me i was wearing my red ball jets i just ran across all of the streets and nothing could catch me
2818164 gee i could set up a really nice dye studio in my garage for that kind of money
2818165 studebaker studebaker go so slow studebaker studebaker go so fast studebaker studebaker fall on the grass
2818166 mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord
2818167 glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah his truth is marching on
2818168 oh shennendoah i long to hear you look away you rolling river
2818169 for the moment nothing legally would prevent them junta members from running
2818170 but whether the members or the president run it all depends on what the future dictates
2818171 for now we have other problems to surmount and the main one is holding elections as soon as possible
2818172 what he had done risked driving the country toward catastrophe
2818173 he was acting like a dictator like somebody who wants to ruin the nation
2818174 we told him thats not the way to do things the military chiefs have arms and munitions they have men under their command they are responsible for securing the country and you cannot just fire them all like that
2818175 we are a moderate muslim country we dont want terrorism here
2818176 but we cant release him now for the security of the country
2818177 ascertaining the comprehension continued interest agreement etc of the person or persons addressed
2818178 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2818179 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2818180 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2818181 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2818182 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2818183 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2818184 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2818185 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2818186 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man
2818187 a lot of that has to do with how hes wanted this job so bad for so long that hes tied himself to president bush
2818188 he should have been talking about veterans issues not his opponent
2818189 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2818190 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2818191 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2818192 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2818193 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2818194 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2818195 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2818196 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2818197 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2818198 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2818199 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
2818200 many projects have taken place in wards without the consultation and participation of ward members and without accountability to the local communities through the ward structures
2818201 how will the existing structures which bring transparency and accountability be utilised in any planning for this programme
2818202 the way its being spent should be discussed in public it should all be transparent
2818203 he is somebody who doesnt want dialogue he wants to close down dialogue
2818204 some officers dont seem to realise that their job is to act in accordance with what councillors want not the other way around
2818205 the real issue here is that councillors are the elected representatives of the people and we have the contacts and the knowledge
2818206 in conditiile in care tot mai multi romani sunt tentati sa si petreaca concediile in strainatate amagiti de multe ori de o agresiva federatia patronatelor din turismul romanesc considera ca turistii romani trebuie sa fie incurajati sa si petreaca vacantele in romania
2818207 prin cele doua proiecte care se adauga la cel din zona ic ponor se va asigura un acces modern pentru zona muntilor apuseni si din judetul cluj si din bihor cele doua proiecte se afla momentan la noi in proces de evaluarea
2818208 interesul nostru in programul operational regional este sa avem cat mai multe aplicatii proiecte care sa contribuie la dezvoltarea locala si la dezvoltarea intregii regiuni cum este acest proiect pentru zona rachitele ic ponor
2818209 sunt optimist si am majorat previziunea pentru intregul an datorita unor recolte foarte bune
2818210 datele privind pib ul chiar ne dau dureri de cap in acest moment
2818211 toate sectoarele merg in jos iar statisticile pentru urmatorul trimestru vor fi chiar mai slabe asa ca este foarte posibil sa intram in recesiune anul acesta
2818212 se fac verificari sa vedem exact cine se face vinovat de aceasta situatie vasluiul este singurul judet din tara care a pierdut finantarea nu este normal sa se piarda acesti bani
2818213 it wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down
2818214 i dont know of any pre existing medical conditions that could have contributed to this tragic accident
2818215 media preturilor politelor la asigurarile obligatorii in tarile din europa centrala chiar si in romania este de aproximativ 200 de euro
2818216 asiguratorii trebuie sa mareasca preturile treptat ca sa nu atraga furia soferilor
2818217 consideram ca la acest moment nu a fost finalizata procedura de evaluare a activelor care apartin fondului proprietatea motivat de faptul ca la acest moment institutia noastra a demarat o serie de consultari cu institutiile publice implicate in portofoliul carora se afla societatile comerciale de la care au fost transmise pachete de actiuni la fondul proprietatea
2818218 pentru motivele mai sus invocate consideram ca nu este oportun ca la acest moment sa fie modificat actul constitutiv al societatii prin mentionarea expresa a numarului de actiuni indisponibilizate apartinand statului roman fiind necesara mai intai clarificarea aspectelor mai sus mentionate
2818219 per ansamblu prima saptamana din august a fost una in care s a manifestat mai multa prudenta comparativ cu atitudinea din finalul lui iulie investitorii tatonand piata si intrand in momentele pe care le au considerat de maxima atractivitate asta explica de ce in unele intervale s a inregistrat o activitate sustinuta iar in altele piata a fost apatica
2818220 cele mai multe contracte au fost incheiate de regula in debutul sedintelor sau mai exact in prima ora precum si in intervalul de dupa deschiderea de la americani care influenteaza de cele mai multe ori directia de evolutie
2818221 dupa o saptamana de lucru pierduta cautand prin zeci de site uri care mai de care mai caraghioase
2818222 introducerea in proportie de 100 a biletelor electronice pentru toate companiile aeriene elimina o vizita la o agentie clasica si plata unui comision sau taxe de mare
2818223 piata este in crestere si tendinta este ca zborurile simple si sau directe care nu necesita o implicare tehnica a unui agent profesionist de ticketing sa fie rezervate si cumparate on line estimam ca in prezent se cumpara on line peste 5 000 de bilete lunar pentru diferite destinatii exceptand companiile low budget numarul lor va creste imediat ce increderea utilizatorilor in programele de rezervari si plata on line va fi mai mare totul depinde de reactia pietei si puterea de absorbtie a serviciilor on line
2818224 o denumire usor de retinut dar in acelasi timp neconventionala
2818225 dar nu excludem si o campanie spre spatiul off line in viitor
2818226 peste 100 de solicitari online ceea ce a fost sub tinta noastra dar imbucurator a fost rata mare de finalizare in prezent ne mentinem la aprox 1000 de vizitatori unici pe saptamana
2818227 imediat cum numarul rezervarilor va creste si vom putea negocia comisionul la platile cu cardul care in acest moment este mare
2818228 este dificil la acesta data sa estimam cind ne vom recupera investitia initiala in conditiile in care piata petrolului exercita presiuni foarte mari asupra preturilor practicate de companiile aeriene si implicit asupra marjei de profit
2818229 romanii sunt destul de receptivi la rezervari online daca la inceput aproximativ 25 din clienti faceau rezervarile online si 75 prin telefon acum procentul s a inversat
2818230 cred ca in perioada urmatoare vom avea cresteri pe volume mici si nu cred ca vom asista la o stabilizare a preturilor piata este foarte foarte volatila si foarte nervoasa si e putin probabil sa avem o stabilizare
2818231 dupa ce vor veni rezultatele financiare vom avea un tablou de ansamblu al emitentilor care va putea fi comparat cu cel al evolutiilor bursiere si se va vedea care dintre cotatii sunt justificate si care nu
2818232 rezultatele financiare pot duce la o stabilizare a pietei dupa publicarea lor ar trebui sa ne asteptam la un trend mai bine conturat si la o dinamica mai buna a pietei
2818233 acest conflict ar trebui sa fie o mare miza pentru europeni deoarece este pusa in joc securitatea lor energetica
2818234 conducta baku supsa trece pe langa osetia de sud si abhazia
2818235 rusia a devastat complet portul poti de la marea neagra important pentru transportul de resurse energetice de la marea caspica si care se afla in apropierea oleoductului baku supsa si a terminalului petrolier supsa
2818236 miza reala e abhazia rusilor le pasa mult mai mult de abhazia decat de osetia jocurile olimpice de la soci vor fi foarte aproape de aceasta regiune nu exista indoiala ca cele doua regiuni separatiste sunt interconectate nu doar pentru ca sunt aceeasi comandanti militari rusi care au se ocupa de ambele zone dar si liderii separatisti sunt in stransa legatura unii cu altii
2818237 inainte de toate exista un interes vital al occidentului cea mai mare amenintare la adresa europei este monopolul rus asupra rutelor de transport energetic din fosta uniune sovietica catre vest singura exceptie este conducta de petrol si gaze care aduce rezervele bogate din azerbaidjan in turcia via georgia daca georgia este infranta sperantele europei la independenta energetica de rusia vor fi si ele spulberate
2818238 orientarea strategica a georgiei si deci posibilitatea ca occidentul statele unite si europenii sa conteze pe georgia si deci pe caucaz pentru aprovizionarea strategica
2818239 nu este poate controlul direct al regiunii dar in orice caz moscova vrea sa demonstreze ca aceasta regiune este in continuare instabila si deci nu poate fi o alternativa serioasa pentru tranzitul de hidrocarburi asupra caruia rusia pretinde in prezent ca detine monopolul
2818240 daca este adevarat ca au existat greseli facute de guvernul georgian ei vor imparti aceasta responbilitate pentru ca au fost foarte apropiati de el si fara indoiala nu l au sprijinit suficient
2818241 sunt foarte prezenti in georgia in tot ceea ce inseamna formarea armatei georgiene au o importanta prezenta de observare si supraveghere a tot ceea ce inseamna coridor strategic
2818242 aceasta arata clar ca rusia nu a vizat numai obiective economice georgiene ci si obiective economice internationale din georgia
2818243 nu au existat transporturi in si dinspre batumi si kulevi de seara trecuta
2818244 m e agora que o cuco cantou por favor coma sua comida
2818245 que pecado posso ter cometido para que um tal mentiroso nascesse de mim
2818246 what about all the people who dont have computers and access to the internet
2818247 theres definitely exterterrestials out there a friend of mine whos a science major saw em last week as he was comin home from a night class at community college in catonsville
2818248 covers this so i felt both safe and comfortable as i sat down next to the older one and asked the younger one to describe what his friend actually saw and whether anyone else had witnessed it
2818249 no me voy a meter con este final tan abierto que no es ni final
2818250 no me voy a meter con este final tan abierto que no es ni final
2818251 better to be thought a fool than speak and remove all doubt
2818252 andrew when did you start thinking i dont care about our sales results
2818253 this is probably themost important week of an earnings season we have had in manyyears
2818254 so we get it right for older australians who havehelped build this nation
2818255 a version of this article appeared in print on august 10 2008 on page ar1 of the new york edition
2818256 the pullbacks come as the marketers grapple with rising commodity costs big price increases rising private label sales and consumers whove been spending less unilever executives last week described the u s market as essentially flat a study by pricewaterhousecoopers for the grocery manufacturers of america showed the percentage of package goods players whose north american sales were shrinking as a share of their total rose to 41 in the fourth quarter from only 6 in the first quarter of last year
2818257 when a company says it is going to meet its fourth quarter estimate by cutting marketing spending and laying off 300 people in north america we take it as a bad sign

2818269 well the convention ran long and this hebrew fella from new york was telling stories about about his life and this wacky guy who lived in the next door cabin named jebediah kramer on the drive back from gettysburg i wanted to take the interstate when i realized that bastard roosevelt hadnt even started the wpa since we wont elect him till next november so i 25 hasnt even been built yet i had to take the back roads and i was delayed in a small west virginia town being forced to be the best man at a wedding where one feller married his sister after that the drive went pretty quick then once in town i stopped at ikes and shot pool with charlie the chicken thief and the sheriff for three hours i won three dollars but they didnt pay me so i shot the sheriff
2818270 no son that movie doesnt come out for 47 years i shot the other sheriff

2818277 i wasnt with any homo i joined the lumbermans hmo its a health maintenance organization it provides healthcare benefits to members while putting strict cost restraints on health providers who form a network which controls costs while reducing overhead allowing for a capitalization of net after market benefits through standardization of practices and although there is a lot of paperwork i can have the premiums taken out of my paycheck pre tax
2818278 john walton you are self employed you dont get a paycheck most people pay us with wheat and sorgham not money how many bushels of corn do you take out pre tax for the premiums you also forgot we dont pay taxes thats why we live on a mountain with no entry roads so the revenuers cant come here and tax us

2818301 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2818302 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2818303 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2818304 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2818305 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2818306 you two are arguing so i dont trust either of you
2818307 refers to obamas march 2008 vote for a non binding budget resolution that would have set general revenue and spending targets for congressional tax writing and appropriations committees the resolution does not contain a specific provision to raise tax rates but rather assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011 it also bears no relation to obamas proposed economic plan in fact obama has stated repeatedly that his plan would increase taxes only for those making more than 250 000 per year
2818308 the most comprehensive nonpartisan analysis of obamas tax proposal available is the tax policy centers comparison of mccains and obamas economic plans that analysis mostly supports obamas claim that his plan wont raise taxes though it says that families earning between 169 480 and 237 040 would see an average tax increase of 486 under obamas plan all those earning less than 169 480 would see tax cuts in fact that hypothetical taxpayer with the 32 000 in taxable income would get a 502 tax cut under obamas plan mccains plan by contrast would leave that persons taxes unchanged
2818309 as we have described before budget resolutions basically set targets for appropriations committees to use they are more like guidelines than actual rules and like many budget resolutions this one passed on a party line vote with just one democrat and two republicans crossing party lines
2818310 budget resolutions merely set targets for tax writing and appropriations committees and dont alter the tax code directly
2818311 the budget resolution is not not a law not binding
2818312 i used to say that barack obama raises taxes i stand corrected
2818313 take this one for instance the choice in this election is stark and simple john mccain said at recent denver event repeating a phrase that is a staple of his stump speech

2818350 thanks to the courage and sacrifice of our soldiers sailors airmen and marines and to brave iraqi fighters the surge has succeeded
2818351 and yet senator obama still cant quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment instead he commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge

2818402 people know everything that there is to know about schools in new york
2818403 unfortunately in this country we dont have that kind of information about schooling
2818404 what we are better off identifying is the kind of extra value that education offers so that we measure the progress people are making not the raw results

2818491 a spiraling narrative that brings together place and perspective in a loose chronology
2818492 life develops in this way too not in a linear progression but as a spiral questions return again and again each time finding different answers
2818493 civilization is not redeemable this culture will not undergo any sort of voluntary transformation to a sane and sustainable way of living if we do not put a halt to it civilization will continue to immiserate the vast majority of humans and to degrade the planet until it civilization and probably the planet collapses the effects of this degradation will continue to harm humans and nonhumans for a very long time
2818494 to a large degree place is absent from the discourse in education educators have begun to talk about community but the ecosystem in which the schools and communities are embedded is rarely mentioned
2818495 you dont need to be in the wild to use the environment for learning life is erupting everywhere weeds grow out of the cracks in cement
2818496 as long as humans have been around weve had to move in order to survive
2818497 the fundamental problem of being social creatures is learning how to get along with one another indigenous peoples have just as many squabbles as we do but they make a commitment to cooperate because they know they are in it for the long run

2818527 the primary mission of the church and therefore of the churches is to proclaim the gospel of christ and gather believers into local churches where they can be built up in the faith and made effective in service both campaign evangelism and personal evangelism are to be encouraged but as often practiced they do not place new believers in vital contact with local churches proportionately too much emphasis has been placed upon multiplying converts and not nearly enough emphasis has been placed on multiplying congregations neither a missionless church not a churchless mission is in accordance with the plan of god
2818528 how this isnt a paramedic run because fill in blank here with any outrageous reason
2818529 every nation puts flags outside their windows and doors so that as one walks around the village you are aware of which building houses which country actually thats not entirely true every nation displays the flag except for america because of security issues america is absent from the dorm flag displays
2818530 the funny thing is because everyone knows that america is here and because theres only 2 building in the entire village without any flags its certainly obvious which buildings house the american athletes

2818536 gentili telespettatori vi stato raccontato che nelle altre democrazie il premier coperto da immunit bene siamo lieti di informarvi che non vero limmunit ce lha solo il nostro
2818537 sono fiero di appartenere a uno stato in cui un premier pu essere investigato come un semplice cittadino un premier non pu essere al di sopra della legge ma nemmeno al di sotto se devo scegliere fra me la consapevolezza di essere innocente e il fatto che restando al mio posto possa mettere in grave imbarazzo il paese che amo e che ho lonore di rappresentare non ho dubbi mi faccio da parte perch anche il primo ministro devessere giudicato come gli altri dimostrer che le accuse di corruzione sono infondate da cittadino qualunque errori ne ho commessi e me ne pento per la carica che occupo ero consapevole di poter finire al centro di attacchi feroci ma nel mio caso si passata la misura
2818538 la stampa israeliana terribile quando ha un pezzo di carne tra i denti difficile che lo molli neppure se si chiama olmert maariv e yedioth ahronot hanno pubblicato le deposizioni del premier parola per parola verbali devastanti per olmert dalla procura spiegano che le prove acquisite vanno ben oltre la testimonianza di talansky olmert dovr testimoniare per la quarta volta
2818539 the other shoe drops this is rielles half of the deal that was finalized at that hotel meeting could it be any more obvious
2818540 brilliant when edwards bought her off he had the foresight or skin nerk nerk nerk to anticipate that paternity might become an issue if something uh blew his cover story so the payoff specifically forbade dna tesing contrast that to the current chief executive who went so far as to have papers forged as part of a massive campaign of deception so he could invade iraq and never gave a second thought to the political consequences when the lies inevitably got outed a chess player putting his queen at risk to capture a measly bishop and then he lost her structurally damaged the entire fucking gop edwards for veep this man doesnt even have casual consensual sex without at least a two year game plan

2818555 congressional authority to buy unlimited stakes in and lend to fannie mae and freddie mac
2818556 here is how it looks to people like me real estate dealings fuelled the economy in most areas of the country for the past decade or more
2818557 today nobody is building unsold home inventories are triple that of 2003 banks no longer give easy credit for home buyers many realtors i know have gone two years without selling a home empty storefronts are becoming common in many areas unemployment among construction trades people is 50 or more tens of thousands of illegal mexicans who did most of the manual labor have returned to mexico to find work what now well i do handyman projects of all sorts big or small and make about 70 90 of what it takes to survive with a family of a wife and three young children my savings make up the rest that cant go on for too much longer we went from affluent and comfortable to nervous and broke with diminished opportunities in just three years we used to be the middle class
2818558 they delivered two to the house across the street and its been vacant since last october
2818559 those starts i had in triple a i got a lot out of that getting stretched out its a different feel definitely
2818560 i threw like probably three sliders the whole time i was down in triple a the last three starts so i was throwing that actually a lot tonight i wasnt expecting to throw it a lot
2818561 it worked well against some of the lefties and the curveball felt pretty good fastball command was a bit shaky at times i think thats another thing too if you get that fastball 0 1 over it makes a huge difference
2818562 the command of his fastball is now his final thing hes going to have to get hes got a good breaking ball and hes got a good presence on the mound hes competitive hes got a lot of the attributes you want as a pitcher
2818563 i was one pitch away from going six innings with giving up one run
2818564 so that was disappointing sort of left a bad taste in my mouth coming off
2818565 chloe was one of 24 kids who competed in the first round of the rapid city public librarys
2818566 it is often attempted to palliate slavery by comparing the state of slaves with our poorer countrymen if the misery of our poor be caused not by the laws of nature but by our institutions great is our sin but how this bears on slavery i cannot see as well might the use of the thumb screw be defended in one land by showing that men in another land suffered from some dreadful disease those who look tenderly at the slave owner and with a cold heart at the slave never seem to put themselves into the position of the latter what a cheerless prospect with not even a hope of change picture to yourself the chance ever hanging over you of your wife and your little children those objects which nature urges even the slave to call his own being torn from you and sold like beasts to the first bidder and these deeds are done and palliated by men who profess to love their neighbours as themselves who believe in god and pray that his will be done on earth it makes ones blood boil yet heart tremble to think that we englishmen and our american descendants with their boastful cry of liberty have been and are so guilty
2818567 we left our town because the situation there is worse than anything ive seen in 18 years of conflict houses are being hit by rockets and heavy artillery aircraft are bombing the roads

2818574 its central to studio support services such as production offices shops wardrobe areas warehouses and equipment
2818575 i saw a lot of production in south carolina filming in warehouses or abandoned buildings which is not appropriate for sophisticated television
2818576 i am pleased and excited that atlas chose to develop its production facility in the charleston area
2818577 creating industry infrastructure like this is critical to south carolinas continuing development of the film and television industries within our state
2818578 our fast rebate program certainly is one of south carolinas attributes

2818586 people know everything that there is to know about schools in new york
2818587 unfortunately in this country we dont have that kind of information about schooling
2818588 what we are better off identifying is the kind of extra value that education offers so that we measure the progress people are making not the raw results
2818589 all information other than those things of course that are subject to privacy provisions should be made open and accountable to parents to the broader community
2818590 but in the end the focus has to be on the child and how they are progressing and what we are doing to improve their educational outcomes
2818591 people know everything that there is to know about schools in new york
2818592 unfortunately in this country we dont have that kind of information about schooling

2818597 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence

2818605 father joes blog is great fun to read too bad i will have to strike him dead with lightning some day
2818606 right after evening prayer i regularly read his blog and note corrections for my upcoming encyclicals
2818607 before i have my security council meeting each morning i check to see whats new at fr joes blog
2818608 this infidel priest is not funny and is ill informed
2818609 he is a right wing bigot who is anti choice and anti woman the goddess is not happy with his blog
2818610 he is the poorest priest i know always pontificating about things he knows nothing about he is a disgrace
2818611 the invasion is going as planned and soon all the clergy will be pod people from outer space starting with father joe
2818612 never have i met someone who was so opposed to true ecumenism and religious freedom i would like to sacrifice him in my dinner pot and wear his head as an ornament voices like his need to be silenced we should all pray and sup together
2818613 in addition to promoting the anti science hoax of intelligent design the discovery institute runs a pro russian site called russia blog and today they come out in favour of russias brutal assault on the breakaway republic of south ossetia
2818614 russias brutal assault on the breakaway republic of south ossetia
2818615 i have been proposing and i am proposing russia act as a guarantor of south ossetian autonomy within georgia
2818616 i love ossetians as a president and as a ordinary citizen of this country i admire and respect ossetian history and culture every ethnic ossetian has been an inseparable part of georgian history for centuries we are proud of you and our unity georgia is strong for its diversity georgia has never been and will never be a mono ethnic country georgia belongs to all of us regardless of our ethnicity lets take care of our country together lets together avoid the violence lets work together for a better future lets forget everything negative that has happened in the past and lets together think about our common future
2818617 the firing positions of georgian troops that had shelled the city of tskhinvali and the positions of peacekeeping forces were suppressed by the ordnance and tanks of formations of the 58th army stationed in the outskirts of the south ossetian capital
2818618 the georgian troops that entered south ossetia are within the range of the firepower of the 58th army units in the future any shooting in the responsibility zone of russian peacekeepers will be stifled
2818619 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2818620 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2818621 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2818622 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2818623 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2818624 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2818625 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2818626 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2818627 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2818628 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2818629 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2818630 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons

2818632 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2818633 breast feeding is associated with resilience against the psychosocial stress linked with parental divorce separation
2818634 theres a lot less verbal communication but lots of tactile communication and eye contact that promotes positive physiological responses
2818635 breast feeding does seem to suppress stress responses in babies and it does seem that theres a protective effect
2818636 in terms of the biological possibility breast milk is pretty amazing stuff and the tactile interaction that goes along with breast feeding does have an influence on the development of neurons
2818637 for most mothers breast feeding doesnt come naturally if the baby doesnt latch on it can lead to feelings of failure and concern about whether or not the baby is getting enough milk women need lots of encouragement and education
2818638 breast feeding is something for mothers and babies to enjoy a time for them to cherish and nurture each other
2818639 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom
2818640 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people

2818642 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid
2818643 this is not just a prank this is serious and the isabella county office needs to prosecute to the fullest extent or we will be calling for a national protest

2818663 the dialogue demands that what is said should be intelligible
2818664 i t would indeed be a disgrace if our dialogue were marked by arrogance the use of bared words or offensive bitterness what gives it its authority is the fact that it affirms the truth shares with others the gifts of charity is itself an example of virtue avoids peremptory language makes no demands it is peaceful has no use for extreme methods is patient under contradiction and inclines towards generosity

2818674 trial by fire improves gold it frees it from all debasing alloy but it does not render it indestructible refine gold as you will it is after all a perishing thing but the trial of the faith of the christian has a nobler result purified and strengthened by the trials it is exposed to under the influence of the holy spirit faith with all the graces which grow out of it survives the wreck of all material things and at the revelation of jesus christ is found to praise and honor and glory the results of all the trails to which they have been exposed in the present state will be found in that character of perfect conformity to the image of god in which consist at once their perfect holiness and their perfect happiness

2818676 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2818677 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2818678 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2818679 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2818680 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2818681 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2818682 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2818683 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2818684 in order for health care reform to be successful it is imperative that we increase access and quality while decreasing the cost of care this legislation through incentives for medical and nursing students the adoption of uniform billing and electronic health records and increasing transparency for consumers achieves those goals
2818685 the ongoing success of our historic health care reform depends on our ability to continue to cut costs in the health care system while we increase quality and the number of insured
2818686 from increased transparency in rate setting to expanded use of electronic records and a tough new code of conduct for gift giving this law charts a bold course to cut costs this is also a true compromise between the house and senate and i commend governor patrick for joining us to take this bold step to help reduce costs in our health care system
2818687 this measure will set a marketing code of conduct to help ensure health care providers make choices about prescription drugs and medical devices for their patients based on therapeutic benefits and cost effectiveness
2818688 i am confident the department of public health pursuant to its regulatory authority will safeguard the confidentiality of companies trade secrets and proprietary information and protect against roadblocks to medical research or the education of health care providers
2818689 biased marketing and financial inducements are destructive to the sacred doctor patient relationship evidence based academic detailing enhances this relationship cost controls disclosure and transparency are imperative as we demand universal access to quality healthcare i commend the governor for standing firmly on the side of the patient and taxpayer

2818941 thus i think everyone through this sharing of cultural idiom one will experience the gospel in his own brush like everyone heard the gospel in his own tongue on the pentecost day
2818942 though the artist their art and the viewer are all impermanent art can provide evidence of contact with the universal creative force beyond time art has a function and a mission to interpret the world to reveal the condition of the soul to encourage our higher nature and awaken the dormant spiritual faculties within every individual

2818967 educatamente le feci notare che avevo varcato lingresso in orario abbondantemente regolare ma non volle sentire ragioni sostenendo con decisione che doveva chiudere lo sportello alle 19 00 in punto le spiegai che avrebbe potuto incorrere nel reato penale di interruzione di servizio pubblico ma quando mi rispose che lei non svolgeva un servizio pubblico bens privato rimasi esterrefatto e ritenni evidente di non poter proseguire oltre mi venne in mente in associazione il parallelo calzante di un autista di un autobus adibito a pubblico servizio che termina il suo turno di lavoro alle ore 19 00 ma trovandosi ancora a qualche chilometro dal capolinea decide di abbandonare la vettura e andarsene a casa una cosa assurda

2818989 they truly deserve the title of world champions we faced a lot of tough competition throughout the season but when our backs were against the wall every player demonstrated the skills and the poise to step up when it mattered the most my players spent hundreds of hours practicing this season and their hard work paid off tonight
2818990 discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation
2818991 contradictions do not exist whenever you think you are facing a contradiction check your premises you will find that one of them is wrong
2818992 the mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven
2818993 there were many reasons for my feeling so happy we were on our way i had seen a dawn and there was knowing that twice since midnight a person had trusted me enough to fall asleep beside me
2818994 meanwhile that limitless radiance which eludes us all spins on taking our day with it teasing and turning us for a time in its vibrant dimensions continuing to spread its blind effulgence when we have gone
2818995 i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived
2818996 a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines with consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do he may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall speak what you think now in hard words and to morrow speak what to morrow thinks in hard words again though it contradict every thing you said to day ah so you shall be sure to be misunderstood is it so bad then to be misunderstood pythagoras was misunderstood and socrates and jesus and luther and copernicus and galileo and newton and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh to be great is to be misunderstood
2818997 there is a popular saying in the personal development world that you become most like the five people you spend most of your time with and i really do believe this to be true
2818998 sometimes having a listening ear is good so please come talk to me if you feel that i understand you have a lot happening so do what feels right at the moment and jump in the car or dont just go with it if you need time to think and pray in quiet which is also very very important you know ralph waldo emerson says that a true friend is someone you think out loud with meaning without any judgement and with total understanding on all levels talk to me
2818999 i want you to just do whatever you feel and know im here for you i want to see you but i am more concerned you are taking it easy and nurturing yourself
2819000 cheerfulness consists principally in the attitude of the mind and is conditioned only incidentally by outside factors

2819022 all the gold that leaves our village is headed to mali to this one man
2819023 he has the means to take it out we dont
2819024 for a long time hes worked with the white people
2819025 we dont live in the bush so we have nothing to do with child labor
2819026 i can assure you that what he declares is only a fraction of what is going out
2819027 if i am wrong you can cut off my head and put it on a platter
2819028 i buy some grams some kilos from here and there
2819029 service or even accept gold from a mine where children work
2819030 it comes from africa and it arrives in the swiss banks thats all you need to know
2819031 there is a desire to deal with this but the question is how
2819032 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
2819033 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
2819034 if i have one wish its that i might someday have a little bit of money
2819035 sometimes i dream that one day ill own something made of gold

2819043 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2819044 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2819045 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2819046 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2819047 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2819048 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2819049 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2819050 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2819051 bon jy vais et je te dis les r ponses apr s tu r p teras tout ce que je te dirais daccord

2819053 i wouldnt pay 4 69 for a bottle of bentley but i might go to 3 99
2819054 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
2819055 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
2819056 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
2819057 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
2819058 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
2819059 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
2819060 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
2819061 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
2819062 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
2819063 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
2819064 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
2819065 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
2819066 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
2819067 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
2819068 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
2819069 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
2819070 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
2819071 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
2819072 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
2819073 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
2819074 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
2819075 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
2819076 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
2819077 pour sen d barasser ils les pendent dans les bois les jettent dans les baines ordure
2819078 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
2819079 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2819080 we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2819081 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2819082 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2819083 tang has no criminal record his neighbors said they hadnt seen any abnormal behavior from him before he left hangzhou
2819084 does anyone believe that it is possible to win the nomination without over these next two months raising all these issues on him wont a single tape of the reverend jeremiah wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
2819085 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
2819086 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2819087 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2819088 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2819089 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2819090 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2819091 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2819092 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2819093 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
2819094 ive been looking for an indicator to let me know where im going to be at and i think today let me know
2819095 i had a real specific mri and doctors even said i had a slight strain in my tendon so it was a little worse than what the u s doctors had seen
2819096 i did have slight doubts but that is just a part of it
2819097 being a track and field athlete some times you think youre superman you can run any time you feel any pain do a warmup spray some stop pain on it and it will go away it went away in about a couple weeks
2819098 someone told me this is one of the most anticipated 100 meter dashes in olympic history
2819099 everyone knows i havent raced since nationals i think that was good for me if i would have ran all rounds of the 200 i would have been fatigued i have seen a lot of people from the u s not running as fast as they were a lot of peoples bodies are tired so i think this rest really did me well
2819100 obviously to hear his voice and get leadership from him meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys
2819101 hes steered our squad through these last four years as we built up our team he talked about trying to move on to volleyball
2819102 hugh has dedicated so much time and energy and his passion has been good for us he just told us it will be difficult but together were going to be much stronger to hear from him was a tremendous relief
2819103 you know as a male sport we tend to hide our feelings a lot but it was definitely a moment where guys let out
2819104 the bachmans were wonderful volleyball fans great followers and supporters of the mens and womens teams
2819105 i think the best way we can honor them is to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball

2819419 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2819420 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2819421 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2819422 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2819423 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2819424 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2819425 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2819426 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2819427 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
2819428 here is another version in the mindquiz series if you are a regular player of this game you already know about it but still for new comers here is a quick description

2819431 weve got to save something for future wolfensteins we cant do him in yet
2819432 thats one of the cool things again about the wolfenstein universe we go back and we pull some of these things from real history and spin this what if story for some of it and some of it just kind of blows out
2819433 so like the kreisau circle originally is more of a group of aristocrats working behind the scenes in hopes to overthrow hitler here theyre gun toting resistance forces fighting on the streets but its kind of nice to take those elements have a framework of reality and build it out
2819434 the culture of our society today is surely oriented toward getting a lot done and slowing things down and being polite is part of this campaign
2819435 like for example here on 24th where you have a very popular bike path and where they have to cross the roadway and they have to cross in the marked crosswalk
2819436 i think sort of reckless abandon going across the street and just sort of demanding respect is not a very good way to get it
2819437 i think we all need reminders at times to be safe on the roadway because of the consequences that happen
2819438 we are the last domestic manufacturer of our type of product

2819443 lots of european companies are hedging their chinese manufacturing positions
2819444 industries are looking more and more at central and eastern europe which are plausible alternatives to china for moving production particularly for costs such as transport
2819445 those companies who wanted to invest in china have largely done so and they are just waking up to the fact that some of the other countries such as india are interesting for manufacturing when they had previously been seen as only good for services
2819446 we have these huge stories going on like the one youre reporting in georgia
2819447 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2819448 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity

2819460 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2819461 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of cheques with our show making fun of christians
2819462 theres no one out there at this time that we feel strongly about
2819463 the doors open to any player who makes us better
2819464 hes scheduled to come in this afternoon but nothing has been done
2819465 i just felt looking down the road with our roster and the numbers that we have i felt pretty confident that in the end that i was probably going to have to make a move with brandon
2819466 doing it at this time is partly because he has been a loyal 49er for the last six years and this gives him an opportunity to get with another squad he wasnt getting as many reps as i know he would like to have
2819467 as far as football goes hes just a leader he has that quality about him he knows his stuff he pays attention in film study hes prepared hes the type of guy you need on a defense
2819468 i think his resume speaks for itself hes everything you want in a football player hes smart gifted talented sure tackler all those things
2819469 thats going to be one of the nfls strongest linebacker corps in the middle

2819492 if we had solid names and evidence at that time we would certainly have done that
2819493 we had reports at that time we put them on notice to that effect and then we started our investigation
2819494 at this point i dont see any reason why someone should not buy things from agriprocessors
2819495 they run a very impressive operation theyre very dedicated to making sure that everything is being done in the most appropriate way possible
2819496 i was shocked when i walked into that plant because i was expecting a lot worse
2819497 if theyre going and being paid by rubashkin then that should be forthrightly disclosed
2819498 its very important if rabbis are going that things look totally above board and that its 100 percent clear that the desire is to do the right thing and not just the expedient thing
2819499 if somebodys being paid youre beholden to them halachah is very clear about this
2819500 to impugn the integrity of 25 people is out of line
2819501 the minute that i got through giving my little dialogue they said thats the past
2819502 i said yeah but the past is what created the problem if their intent is to move forward i cant move forward until this issue is totally totally done
2819503 i wish everybody would be treated like we treat people
2819504 these are simple people they are a family of butchers

2819508 companies that work with animals should have policies and practices in place to insure they are treated humanely at all points of the production cycle
2819509 we need an ethical stamp of approval on nutritious plant foods organic beans whole grains veggie burgers and more that dont take the lives of innocent animals that arent the worst dietary contributors to global warming the worst polluters and resource drainers and the most scientifically incriminated dietary risk factors of the nations deadliest diseases
2819510 this is especially important at a time when israel faces the worst drought in history and a 2007 israel union for environmental defense report projects that global warming will cause severe heat waves and storms up to 30 percent less rainfall and severe flooding from a rising mediterranean sea

2819516 the papacy through successive popes and councils has always traced its origins and title deeds to the unique commission reported to have been given by jesus christ to peter the chief of his apostles later to be martyred when organizing the earliest group of christians at rome
2819517 it seems certain that peter spent his closing years in rome although the nt appears silent about such a stay it is supported by 1 peter 5 13 where babylon is a code name for rome and by the strong case for linking the gospel of mark who as peters companion 1 pet 5 13 is said to have derived its substance from him with rome to early writers like clement of rome c 95 ignatius of antioch c 107 and irenaeus c 180 it was common knowledge that he worked and died in rome
2819518 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them

2819523 its a busy and popular route but we see it as under served because theres no low fare option
2819524 expansion is not driven by anything other than the fact that the business model is working well and there seems to be buoyancy in those markets that should enable us to do what weve done in all the other markets which is grow them
2819525 pacific blue is the first low cost carrier to operate on the sydney sector which is the largest single international route on offer from auckland airport
2819526 but respectfully the time has come for him to resign
2819527 i want to see him get a chance to move on in a way where he will be in a position to do what he needs to do for him and to heal as well
2819528 its not just about the mayor its about the climate that is taking place in our city
2819529 we have an economic situation in our city that certainly needs addressing
2819530 we need to have a city wide conversation on how we can come together and maximizes our efficiencies and strengths at this time
2819531 any true pastor will understand my position in this we are the watchmen for individual souls
2819532 whether kwame kilpatrick is the mayor or not he has a soul and thats what im concerned about
2819533 but jim those games are meaningless theyre played by a bunch of guys destined to be car salesmen or accountants by september thats why as expensive as they are i usually just give my preseason tickets away or eat them
2819534 but as a season ticket holder i think its just ridiculous to make me buy those games in order to keep my season package
2819535 take away burkes stanley cup win and he hasnt really won anything
2819536 the very fact that al strachan reported it in my opinion makes it extremely likely it has no factual basis what so ever i deny it specifically and categorically i have never discussed brendan morrison with buffalo i have never discussed bryan allen with buffalo and i have not talked to darcy regier in three weeks so im shocked that a respectable media outlet like hockey night in canada would allow this garbage rumour mongering to take place im amazed that whoever produces that show would tolerate this
2819537 the fact that al strachan reported this trade rumour by itself should make it suspect
2819538 his accuracy rate on rumours like this is non existent
2819539 the fact that a respected media like hockey night in canada would allow this type of garbage to be aired is ridiculous
2819540 i have never talked to the buffalo sabres about either of the players that were mentioned in that deal
2819541 creo fue un buen partido tuvimos el bal n y oportunidades creo que nos sacan el partido con un error de nosotros por no estar concentrados y eso nos pas lo mismo ante tecos tuvimos para meter el segundo gol creo que nos falt eso para estar m s tranquilos m s seguros y manejar el partido pero se nos complic cuando monterrey mand gente al frente
2819542 se ha visto mejor el equipo se ha mostrado m s concentrado hemos hecho mejor las cosas hemos tenido mejor posesi n de pelota y creo que hay mejorar en lo defensivo para que no nos vuelva a suceder esto
2819543 desde la primera fecha pumas ha mostrado determinaci n en sus partidos contra necaxa fuimos un equipo que sali a proponer contra santos jugamos con inteligencia con mucho orden defensivo y el d a de hoy sab amos que iba a ser un partido bastante dif cil con toluca que es un gran equipo pero creo que merecimos el triunfo por lo que mostramos en la cancha
2819544 jugamos contra un gran equipo que es toluca que se par muy bien en la cancha comenz ganando el partido procur mantener un orden defensivo importante nosotros nunca nos desesperamos buscamos tener la posesi n de la pelota para abrirlos y buscar las oportunidades de gol yo creo que el equipo hizo un gran esfuerzo hoy al conseguir los tres puntos
2819545 pumas siempre ha demostrado que pelea los 90 minutos es importante pelear pero con orden muchas veces uno se desespera queriendo meter el gol como sea y acaba dejando espacios al rival tuvimos un equipo en todas las l neas muy compacto y esto fue importante para lograr el triunfo
2819546 la selecci n siempre va a motivar a uno el estar ah defender al pa s me motiva mucho pero hoy s lo pens en pumas en hacer las cosas bien hacer lo que se entren durante la semana logramos un triunfo importante en casa y creo que el equipo va por buen camino estamos en un grupo bastante dif cil as que es importante sumar de tres en casa
2819547 we train hundreds of people we spend 800 000 per election and people dont care its difficult to understand
2819548 the trend has been that numbers will go up a bit more than the last election but that doesnt seem to be the case this year
2819549 its a disappointment that there is such sheer disinterest in this election
2819550 tengo las mejores sensaciones me siento orgulloso y muy contento de poder participar en la champions league juegue o no desde el primer d a el t cnico nos ha inculcado que el partido contra el wisla es una final el trabajo de la pretemporada ha sido bueno y esperamos llegar en las mejores condiciones
2819551 la adaptaci n me est costando un poco el recreativo es totalmente diferente al bar a aqu se juega mucho m s al ataque de hecho el cambio es total tambi n por la prensa los viajes y el vestuario hay muchas diferencias
2819552 con leo messi me llevo bastante bien supongo porque es sudamericano pero quien me trata como si fuera un hijo es sylvinho es una persona excelente
2819553 es verdad que noto mucho cari o y consideraci n por parte de la gente
2819554 me alegro mucho por ese reconocimiento de la gente conmigo pero no me siento ni me gusta nada que se diga que soy la estrella ni nada parecido
2819555 a n me queda mucho pero estoy contento porque he tenido buenas sensaciones y he estado bastante bien pero todav a me queda mucho trabajo y esta ser una buena semana para seguir poni ndome a tono
2819556 por ah se habl un poco que nos sacaron el empate en los ltimos minutos nos est pasando algo el equipo baja lo futbol stico y por ah es lo que estamos analizando y ya est la realidad es est dos puntos de nueve posibles y ahora pensar en toluca y prepararnos m s
2819557 la idea era porque ya sab amos que nos iba a dejar espacios sabemos de la filosof a de monterrey y m s por ser la volpe sab amos que se ir an con todo al frente y ten amos que aprovechar los espacios y no nos result y ellos se fueron al frente y de tanto insistir les sali esa gran jugada en los ltimos minutos y nos doli tanto el empate
2819558 es normal me est costando un poco pero me estoy sintiendo muy bien y hay mucha comunicaci n con reynoso me ha apoyado bastante y estamos bien tambi n por ah la filosof a de nosotros es ir a la ofensiva puede ser que se descuide poquito pero es parte de la filosof a
2819559 tengo por ah cualidades para ir al frente pero tambi n respeto lo que diga el profe pero ahora lo m o es defender cuando cambiamos a l nea de cuatro hab a la facilidad de ir pero yo hago lo que me dice el profe y no hay problema
2819560 sabemos que los resultados no son los que esper bamos pero no es una situaci n catastr fica como muchos la quieren ver sobre todo que a nivel futbol stico no estamos tan alejados eso s sabemos que no estamos al nivel que el torneo anterior
2819561 creo que andamos mucho mejor que lo que reflejan esos dos puntos y quiz no andamos tan brillantes como el torneo pasado donde fuimos s per l deres no andamos tan mal como para tener dos puntos y eso s te deja cierta frustraci n porque el equipo en general trabaja bien los partidos y en los ltimos minutos nos est n empatando
2819562 la verdad es dif cil contestar a la directiva nosotros pensamos en lo nuestro que es trabajar y en ese sentido las opiniones de la directiva son respetables pero nosotros debemos de enfocarnos en nuestro trabajo y esa es la clave para mejorar
2819563 para nosotros es semana doble la aduana de toluca es dif cil hay que tratar de sacar los tres puntos para mejorar en la confianza que nos falta al equipo el chepo con nosotros dej una buena imagen nosotros sabemos m s o menos como para sus equipos as que esperemos sea buen partido
2819564 pelear todos los a os por estar entre los cuatro primeros estar en la final de la copa del rey y luchar por el campeonato hasta el final
2819565 argentina tiene que salir campe n te exigen que lo hagas en todos los torneos que juegues
2819566 no la verdad es que hay tranquilidad esto es lo bueno hay que tener paciencia y saber lo que nos estamos jugando entonces creo que hay que tener la m xima seriedad afrontar este partido como si fuera tratar de cerrar lo que se hizo el a o pasado sabemos todos los que nos estamos jugando
2819567 muy bien el equipo est muy confiado y con muchas ganas pero siempre lo que mandan son los resultados as que esperemos que llegue le primer partido para ver c mo est el equipo a medida que vayan pasando los partidos es cuando se va a ir soltando el equipo y demostrando su mejor futbol
2819568 es especial uno ya le agarr cari o ya a todo esto y se siente part cipe de lo que es la instituci n entonces se pone un poquito en la piel de los dirigentes y la gente que sabes que lo est n esperando con mucha ansiedad ojal podamos devolver al equipo y la instituci n donde se merecen que es jugar la champions cada a o
2819569 sabemos que son equipos acostumbrados a jugar en esa competici n pero aqu hay muchos jugadores internacionales y referentes en la selecci n ellos tienen muy buen equipo van a intentar salir los primeros minutos a llevarse el partido a tratar de llevarnos por delante a nosotros pero ah es cuando debemos tratar de poner ese respeto que tenemos que tener dentro del campo de juego y jugarles de igual a igual
2819570 no en partidos as y m s c mo est ahora el f tbol no hay favoritos antes ten as veinte equipos en el mundo que sab an que iban a ganar pero ahora ya el f tbol se emparej mucho en todas las partes del mundo no hay favorito
2819571 es un poquito anticipado pero nosotros vamos muy confiados vamos a ir a buscar el partido si ganamos all encarrilamos mucho la eliminatoria pero lo importante all ser a marcar marcando all y venir a jugar al calder n con un estadio completamente lleno nos puede tranquilizar bastante
2819572 al principio es un poco raro porque vas de pretemporada y tienes cuatro partidos y no puedes trabajar bien espec ficamente lo que es la parte f sica despu s se trabaj muy bien en los ngeles de san rafael as que el equipo f sicamente va a llegar muy bien y despu s lo m s importante es lo t ctico y que el bal n entre
2819573 s por ah cosas que el a o pasado no concret bamos creo que este a o por lo menos en pretemporada lo que se estuvo trabajando se llev muy bien a cabo y eso muy importante pero siempre lo m s importante son los partidos oficiales
2819574 es lo mejor seguir esa l nea que est llevando el club es lo principal el club se tiene que manejar con una base de jugadores e ir modificando lo menos posible si tienes que vender tratar de traer jugadores de la misma categor a o mejores para intentar todos los a os pelear por estar entre los cuatro primeros empezar a pelear por estar en la final de la copa del rey y ojal se pueda luchar por el campeonato hasta el final
2819575 s pero con tranquilidad y paciencia tampoco nos vamos a volver locos en la primera fecha por quedar primeros y con salir campeones sabemos que es muy dif cil que el a o es muy largo y que la temporada se hace muy pesada entonces lo principal es arrancar bien tenemos partidos para tratar de estar ah arriba y luego la confianza te va llevando a soltarte y desplegar buen futbol
2819576 es normal cuando est s en un club grande te van a exigir al m ximo nosotros sabemos esa exigencia se est n haciendo todos esos desgastes en la parte de la directiva para tratar que el equipo tenga aspiraciones para conseguir algo
2819577 son muy buenos tienen la calidad para estar ac entonces eso es lo importante son muy buenas personas se adaptaron muy bien y creo que nosotros tratamos de que todos los que vengan se sientan muy c modos y as lo est n demostrando est n muy sueltos muy confiados y eso es lo importante que lo bueno que hicieron en otros clubes para venir aqu lo empiecen a demostrar aqu y llevarlo al conjunto
2819578 el a o pasado tambi n era muy competitiva llevamos dos temporadas muy buenas sacando las lesiones que son cosas que uno no lo espera creo que hace dos a os que se est manejando muy buen plantel si quieres pelear por cosas importantes tienes que manejarte con estos nombres
2819579 ojal que pueda seguir marcando goles y ayudar al equipo siempre a o tras a o me quiero superar soy muy exigente conmigo mismo y uno siempre quiere hacer goles y aportarle cosas al equipo pero no tengo una meta o algo sino ir mejorando semana tras semana
2819580 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2819581 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2819582 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2819583 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2819584 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2819585 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2819586 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2819587 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2819588 he hadnt been chief minister very long and that in itself was a difficulty because his record in office was quite short
2819589 have they started a formal vetting process with you in other words are they asking for documents irs returns stuff like that
2819590 i cant discuss the process wolf i hope you appreciate that
2819591 you take it however you want i cant discuss the process
2819592 when youre facing 4 a gallon at the pump you have to be sensitive to what the people of florida and in senator mccains case the people of america are dealing with its an energy crisis theres no question about it and from a florida perspective so long as its far enough clean enough and safe enough were in favor of looking into it in order to alleviate the problem at the pump
2819593 there are different ways to manage air space when no air traffic control is available and those options are being looked at both by the civil aviation authority and air services australia but no decision has been made on this at this stage
2819594 what were better off identifying is the kind of extra value that education offers so that we measure the progress people are making not the raw result
2819595 theres short term goals and theres long term goals like playing for the all blacks
2819596 i want to become a dominant no 13 outside centre and be considered one of the best centres going around in world rugby and i want to play for the all blacks one day
2819597 but first i just want to play good footy i want to win the competition with toulon and repay the faith that coach tana umaga has shown in me by getting out there and helping this team
2819598 its a new game and a new challenge and i know ive got a lot to learn but im excited to be learning off one of the all time greats in tana umaga
2819599 i think if i am as committed as i was to playing rugby league and learning the game then the next two years will work out
2819600 i think probably a forward going into the forwards would be a lot more difficult because theres a lot of things that are different
2819601 in the backs its still hard because of all the technical things its not as easy as people think
2819602 ive written down all the plays and that the plays are pretty simple
2819603 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles
2819604 i cant recall how many times i have seen mccaw vary his behaviour following a refs advice hence in the wc qf barnes whistled him out of the game
2819605 from the seasons perspective we all know how the premiership table is tightening up so it was a pretty critical game for both clubs
2819606 its good for us because a win makes it a bit better for andrew great for him
2819607 we kicked over 100 points in those conditions and for our forward line to have 12 goal scorers weve just got to keep finding ways of making sure we can kick a score
2819608 in the first half i thought our kicking in particular was very good and we got some really powerful running which you could argue weve lacked a bit
2819609 were bitterly disappointed with our performance season on the line stuff and to come over and not play our game style was disappointing
2819610 it started virtually from the first kick of the game
2819611 they played the basics of the game a hell of a lot better than what we did from start to finish and that was clearly the difference between the two sides
2819612 under the circumstances its been a pretty torrid week we were able to generate enough enthusiasm and enough desire to play a very good football side and win
2819613 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles
2819614 i cant recall how many times i have seen mccaw vary his behaviour following a refs advice hence in the wc qf barnes whistled him out of the game
2819615 certainly losing a couple of players and a few that were sore we had to keep rotating and even getting mcnamara to see if he could give us three or four more minutes to give another player a rest
2819616 and to go on and really battle through that for a young player like that is outstanding
2819617 he didnt question it he was putting his hand up saying i can go out and have a go im about 80 per cent
2819618 that sort of spirit from the team is what you always want to see and i think theres been a couple of games this year where we havent seen it this is what we expect now and this is what should be the norm and what we aim for
2819619 its really just the players being able to look each other in the eye and say we did what we expect from each other
2819620 great things happen when you attack the footy and sometimes things open up for you
2819621 youve just got to have that desire and its great to see a player whos only got a few games left in him still wanting to do that for the team
2819622 i would have thought 12 wins would have to get you into the eight and we are sitting on eight at the moment with only three games to go so it does look extremely unlikely
2819623 we played some very average football in the first half
2819624 our intensity around the ball wasnt good i thought their midfield really cleaned us up early in the game i thought our defenders were also on the back foot and were led to the ball
2819625 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles
2819626 i cant recall how many times i have seen mccaw vary his behaviour following a refs advice hence in the wc qf barnes whistled him out of the game
2819627 that was a great game friday night melbourne were unreal and so were manly and our standard certainly wasnt there today
2819628 theyre both great teams that play well as a team and at moment theyre ahead of everyone else unless a couple of teams get a bit of momentum going into the semis
2819629 were not as good as manly and melbourne weve got a lot of improvement to do over the next four or five weeks
2819630 well just keep punching away and do everything we can to make the top four and get a home semi final thats our goal
2819631 itd cost me a lot of money if we had have got beaten because i wouldve unloaded
2819632 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles
2819633 i cant recall how many times i have seen mccaw vary his behaviour following a refs advice hence in the wc qf barnes whistled him out of the game
2819634 but who doesnt want to see south africans and new zealanders beat each other up in sub zero temperatures while an egg shaped abomination bounces around at awkward angles
2819635 i cant recall how many times i have seen mccaw vary his behaviour following a refs advice hence in the wc qf barnes whistled him out of the game
2819636 instead of keeping their promise to drain the swamp of corruption in washington house democrats are sinking in it chairman rangels own public admissions about his conduct make clear that his sweetheart deals violate house rules as well as state and federal laws
2819637 we certainly will be impressing on our athletes through their sports section managers that when their competition finishes and they go downtown it would be wise to be branded
2819638 we really should be insisting they should wear their team gear i think that might be a small precaution i think there is more likelihood of people keeping an eye out for you security and volunteers if you are in olympic gear
2819639 i want to take this opportunity to express profound sympathy to the families
2819640 renewable energy to transform our economy create jobs and energy independence thats john mccain
2819641 every time i lose something something good happens but i wont be deliberately losing my things though
2819642 i was very frustrated and disappointed and my eyes welled up
2819643 all the time and effort such as foregoing my studies to sail full time for one and a half years had gone to waste
2819644 it didnt hit me until we finished the race and went ashore after i put my things down i just sat there and cried
2819645 we had to get back to sailing mode quickly we had to sharpen our boat handling starting procedures acceleration manoeuvres and line judging before heading out for the games
2819646 weve sailed here in two test events in 2006 and 2007 and it tends to have light winds averaging about four to five knots but there can be choppy currents from offshore typhoons it can get very unpredictable with frequent wind shifts
2819647 the key to a good race here is a good start and staying clear of the pack in order to get the space to manoeuvre and catch as much wind as possible
2819648 government websites are loaded with graphical images and pdf files that blind and visually impaired persons cannot read
2819649 but the problem is with rich internet applications which dont give blind persons using screen readers the information they need to comprehend the page
2819650 the government needs to update their guidelines on how to make their websites accessible
2819651 if they dont meet our demands within the next few weeks were ready to move ahead with litigation
2819652 it appeared to us and still seems to us to represent a violation of the equality clause in the charter of rights and freedoms which guarantees equal benefits from government services to amongst others people with disabilities such as ms jodhan
2819653 we want the government to live up to their commitments we want the current standards to be enforced and we want these standards to be increased because of advancing technology
2819654 the government of canada is committed to ensuring web accessibility for all canadians
2819655 all government departments and agencies are devoting resources and are actively working towards implementing standards which are intended to ensure that government websites are accessible
2819656 we as a public thai company should adhere to thai law in this connection the law states that the place of the meeting shall be in the province in which the head office of the company is located or in a nearby province unless otherwise stipulated by the articles of association
2819657 unlike singapore incorporated companies which are listed on the sgx st the company does not maintain a register of substantial shareholders or a register of directors shareholdings
2819658 similarly the directors are not required to provide the company with notices of changes in their respective indirect interests in shares
2819659 this arrangement allows shareholders and their voting interests to be represented at the meetings of these thai companies
2819660 votes cast by the shareholders will be collated by cdp and conveyed to the custodian in thailand who in turn represents this to the companies
2819661 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2819662 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2819663 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2819664 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2819665 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2819666 i heard where its a misery wrapped in an enema that doesnt sound too good
2819667 a mudan a de regime o objetivo de seu governo a derrocada de um governo eleito democraticamente
2819668 os dias em que l deres na europa tombavam mediante a for a militar acabaram
2819669 nunca utilizamos esta terminologia em nosso pensamento pol tico n s somos pela democracia na ge rgia
2819670 em algumas ocasi es h l deres eleitos democr tica ou semi democraticamente que provocam grandes problemas a seus pa ses e s vezes esses l deres t m que se perguntar qu o teis foram para sua gente

2819672 a retirada das for as georgianas da oss tia do sul e a aceita o de um acordo para n o usar a for a
2819673 ainda n o vi uma minuta de resolu o assim se temos que nos unir para uma resolu o tem que haver algo que possamos aceitar
2819674 pelo menos o mundo tem que saber que todos estamos unidos e que a r ssia que est no lado errado
2819675 carece de uma correta e completa compreens o da complexidade da situa o
2819676 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2819677 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2819678 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2819679 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2819680 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games i do not think it is related to the olympics
2819681 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2819682 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2819683 under certain circumstances companies can rely on their websites and blogs to meet the public disclosure requirements under regulation fd fair disclosure according to new guidance unanimously approved by the us securities and exchange commission today
2819684 the competition was a victory for sports because sports stands for friendship we have had so many big wars in the 20th century what we need is peace that is something politics can learn from sport
2819685 nino competed for the soviet union for many years we are friends and our embrace should show that politics can learn from sports
2819686 i dont want to support russia georgia or abkhazia but i think georgia is doing a stupid thing by making war during the olympic games
2819687 the issue is that all of their drivers are non singaporeans
2819688 the primary criterion is for the driver to be a singapore citizen if this criterion is met the driver will then be assessed on other criteria which include his or her track record ie ranked top 10 in at least one international race
2819689 however every athlete has his working habits many drivers may be good individually but they may not be able to play a team role
2819690 credible amateur drivers who can paddle a touring or gt car reasonably well
2819691 a motor racing team is just like an orchestra a band where you have different people playing different instruments coming together to make this successful
2819692 as soon as i turned at the 150 i looked at the scoreboard and i was like wow were really tight together i thought to myself wow this is going to be a fun and fast 200 metres to go
2819693 i then just remember coming to the wall and it was the same kind of feeling as athens
2819694 as i was coming into the last 50 to 20m of the race in athens i saw myself out there in front and smiled i had the same feeling this morning seeing laszlo and ryan i just sort of smiled
2819695 i am as prepared as i can be at this moment i am in the best shape i could be in
2819696 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2819697 if he becomes prime minister i will get out of the country give everything to him
2819698 there are certain things that are out of bounds for public discussion even if held in a private place
2819699 we believe that open discussions and dialogues on issues of religious conversions are imperative to find solutions
2819700 i want to say thanks for taking the time to talk to me about the sticky mess we are in with our loan i really appreciate your honesty and letting me know there is not anything in your book that will help us in this unique situation
2819701 i found your site on technorati and read a few of your other posts keep up the good work i just added
2819702 i head up fixed income ir at ambac please understand that ambac did not push for the new fas157
2819703 a vote is like a rifle its usefulness depends upon the character of the user
2819704 hey wanna take a look at the moon through a telescope
2819705 we have reached the semi finals and the team badly wants to win the singapore cup
2819706 this league game will prove a very important dress rehearsal for the semi finals were looking for a vital morale booster
2819707 people all wondered if they were going to collapse but in the end i think they actually played better
2819708 when khairul was their captain he was the focal point but now other players will be out to prove themselves
2819709 khairul is a very good player but hes not the young lions
2819710 the young lions have dangerous players like isa halim and obadin aikhena and theyve made themselves a very difficult team to beat now itll be a tough game at our stadium
2819711 the logic of professor chamber along with his colleagues roland and rose once again entirely misses the constitutional point from the standpoint of the donor whose privacy right is being compromised now by virtue of his her public participation in the election process
2819712 finally we start to see his smile not everybody knows that he hadnt played an official game for four months but a talented player like him will regain his form very fast
2819713 i was a little tired this morning but i actually never felt so relaxed before a race
2819714 i just told myself to go all out i was not fast in the first 50 metres but in the last 50 i really went all out
2819715 she was too slow in the first 50 coming up too sharp for the waves from the other swimmers to buffet her
2819716 she was also slow on the turn and that meant she came up for the last 50 against the waves of the leaders
2819717 we will work on getting it right and getting her to stay relaxed and focused if we can get her to swim the first 50 the way she did in the heats and repeat the second 50 from this morning then we will have the perfect race
2819718 there have been swimmers whove said that being short i could not get to the world level
2819719 some australian coaches said i was too small to swim so fast
2819720 i was really angry with that and wanted to show them what i could do
2819721 its wonderful to have her up there someone new to shake things up
2819722 i have got my best time already and i cant promise anything
2819723 but i will try because i dont want to let singapore down
2819724 its very difficult to get a rough society onto a cultivated plane where people are considerate to one another it will take more time to develop and mature culturally as a people i will not see it maybe you will live long enough to see it i wish you well
2819725 there is a difference between standing on the correct side of the escalator and the act of offering a helping hand to a woman struggling with a child stroller to get up the stairs the former shows singaporeans well trained ability to abide by the rules the latter requires an instinctive nature to help others without needing to be prompted by posters and reminders
2819726 i think the majority of singaporeans are grateful and in many ways gracious the question is how to bring it out and make it more apparent to people around us so what we are doing is really a matter of awareness than anything else
2819727 i knew i had to go out hard in the first 200m because butterfly and backstroke are my best strokes i knew hoff is an amazing breaststroker so i got a lot of confidence turning at the end of the breaststroke knowing i was in the lead
2819728 they are always sitting down and reading newspapers so i organised this senior olympics for them
2819729 i was tired organising this but i am happy to see them enjoy themselves
2819730 singaporean muslims are among the most moderate and progressive in the world
2819731 the luxury of being able to participate in gender discourse without a threat to your life and security is not a luxury that muslims in some parts of the world can afford
2819732 fi singapore willresearch into three areas indonesian malaysian and tamil language literature on islamic law we will also look at works written in english in this region
2819733 that speed of communication has changed the way in which decisions are made and i think that is probably much more significant than the whole post cold war security environment
2819734 at the end of the cold war the assumption was that capacity in languages capacity in understanding particular areas was less significant but in iraq for example you need to know the local language you need to be familiar with local issues otherwise as the americans are now finding you have a simplistic model of what iraqi society is like and yet your armed forces have to deal with that environment
2819735 such a graduate would have a good feel both of contemporary management techniques as well as the capacity to analyse political and economic risks
2819736 wars today are not wars fought just between armies most casualties actually involve civilians far more civilians die than military men do in the past that also occurred but our focus was always on seeing wars as the clash of two armies
2819737 where their paths cross at different points in their lives
2819738 i am somebody who is multi functional one of the reasons i took up the job is that i hoped to do my own research
2819739 vamos a convocar al di logo despu s del 10 de agosto
2819740 el gobierno hizo todos los esfuerzos para dialogar con las fuerzas pol ticas de la oposici n y stas hicieron todos los esfuerzos para rechazar el di logo finalmente dijimos vayamos al di logo despu s del 10 lo que vamos a hacer es cumplir nuestro compromiso
2819741 please rearrange your objects because i cant figure out in which order to save them because they have complex interdependencies
2819742 please rearrange the projects in your solution because i cant figure out in what order to build them
2819743 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2819744 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2819745 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2819746 we understand the situation and communication could have been much better
2819747 we should have informed the market more timely about the changes
2819748 we think the kind of judgment that market has made is that there is something wrong when there is nothing wrong
2819749 the timing and communication of this major change could have been better planned
2819750 the first priority of mr jiang is to seek continuation of the existing strategy and policies of cosco corp while familiarising himself with a new working environment and industry
2819751 jiangs background has nothing to do with shipbuilding he oversaw the operation of shipping fleets
2819752 we were mentally prepared not to underestimate anybody this is the olympics after all and it is easy for upsets to happen
2819753 so we were mindful of that and do our best to get a point at a time
2819754 weve done some preparations analysing the way they play by studying their videos
2819755 were looking forward to the match as athletes the olympics are the pinnacle and we really want to bring out what weve been training and preparing for all these years to get the best possible result
2819756 with in depth consumer insights and feedback acquired since the successful launch of mocca we believe that the newly evolved mocca with oneguide is what the internet community wants one single touch point or rather what we call a single click point
2819757 if you are looking for the perfect home mocca gives you a host ofcomprehensive information to make a well informed purchase like satellite maps of the area property trends of transacted prices to even the schools in the vicinity
2819758 for example the simple act of giving up your seat on a bus not because youre on a specially designated seat for the elderly but because others need it more than you or being considerate to other road users not road hogging or failing to give way to others
2819759 change has to be come from within the individual simply put an individual must have the desire to change or else endless campaigns and government efforts may prove futile even 50 years from now
2819760 there is a difference between standing on the correct side of the escalator and the act of offering a helping hand to a woman struggling with a child stroller to get up the stairs the former shows singaporeans well trained ability to abide by the rules the latter requires an instinctive nature to help others without needing to be prompted by posters and reminders
2819761 i think the majority of singaporeans are grateful and in many ways gracious the question is how to bring it out and make it more apparent to people around us so what we are doing is really a matter of awareness than anything else

2819764 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2819765 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2819766 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2819767 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2819768 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2819769 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2819770 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2819771 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2819772 the policeman involved in the kidnapping was close to this family they tried to kill the girls to prevent them from telling the truth
2819773 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in beijing
2819774 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2819775 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2819776 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2819777 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2819778 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2819779 my mother gives me a lot of support to do this dancing
2819780 the empty seats are a challenge for us and we are trying to manage it
2819781 quite a lot of tickets were taken up by sponsors and journalists maybe some dont fancy the preliminary rounds
2819782 its a big event skateboarders of all ages and levels come to compete
2819783 you wouldnt believe all of the types of tricks you can see at a competition like this one
2819784 we created this competition to bring together members of the community while also doing it for a good cause
2819785 the money will go toward the charities and next years competition
2819786 part of my routine included grinding the quarter pipe and doing a back 180
2819787 i love skateboarding in front of big crowds of people
2819788 during competitions i just want to do the biggest and best tricks im able to do within the time period thats allowed
2819789 the competition was a great way for skateboarders to get out there and show off their tricks and abilities
2819790 we cant wait to see how many people show up for next years event
2819791 these are people who dont know how to do what they need to do and are not getting the message
2819792 what were hoping is their friends or family or caregiver or a neighbor does have access and is checking it for them
2819793 the irs also set up an 800 number to walk people through the process
2819794 the doom and gloom stories are getting old for everybody
2819795 which is kind of contrary to what you hear in the marketplace
2819796 we are centrally located in the county and we have very high traffic volumes and shopper volumes
2819797 with the demographics we have it works well for them to locate in our community
2819798 i couldnt go anywhere and get what i wanted to eat
2819799 when the chain can also layer in excitement through new or limited time offerings they help create an environment where consumers want to come back
2819800 need to bring new strategies and tactics to the table
2819801 theyre making room for new concepts and people want new concepts
2819802 when we started this whole journey the economy wasnt where it is now
2819803 we want it to be a healthy alternative some place wed like to go
2819804 it is going to be a festive setting for athletic events
2819805 this belongs to the community and we want to make sure they can touch and feel all of it
2819806 both camps are very confident but there is one difference
2819807 est dif cil a nossa situa o tem sido muito f cil jogar contra a gente qualquer um dois o advers rio entra na defesa e chega na cara do gol a toda hora
2819808 est faltando tudo falta aten o e qualidade tamb m

2819810 primeiro eu penso em ajudar a equipe a artilharia ser conseq ncia e espero conseguir os dois ao mesmo tempo
2819811 queremos nos classificar no primeiro lugar do grupo mas de todas as maneiras hora de cuidar do aspecto f sico
2819812 com certeza vamos fazer algumas altera es e podemos poupar alguns atletas que n o estejam 100
2819813 o triunfo de hoje domingo foi importante porque nos coloca na pr xima rodada mas o time n o rendeu o que poderia estamos contentes mas sabemos que precisamos melhorar o nosso jogo
2819814 os nossos jogadores cuidaram muito bem da bola e atuou com bastante seguran a mas n o podemos confundir posse de bola com dormir com ela nos p s devemos melhorar o funcionamento do passe para n o dependermos sempre dos destaques individuais
2819815 sempre bom somar pontos principalmente em uma partida fora de casa contra um advers rio que est brigando diretamente conosco pela vaga agora temos que aproveitar os jogos em casa para garantir uma das vagas

2819820 it retains its title of the best security conference available if you have to pick just one a year this should be it
2819821 this is the way ive always done it so tell it to my high school cs teacher
2819822 i was starting to swing the bat a little better the team is playing good
2819823 it was just a big disappointment for something like this to happen
2819824 yeah probably could be thats why im going back to tampa
2819825 there have been a lot of big hits hes had hitting in the three hole for us
2819826 one thing about carl he has a propensity to come through in those moments thats what ive seen thee last couple of years this guy gets big hits
2819827 we have the mechanics within what we have right now if we choose to do something else we can do that also
2819828 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2819829 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2819830 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2819831 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2819832 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2819833 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2819834 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2819835 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
2819836 its taking quite a bit of work to extract them
2819837 for the moment nothing legally would prevent them junta members from running
2819838 but whether the members or the president run it all depends on what the future dictates
2819839 for now we have other problems to surmount and the main one is holding elections as soon as possible
2819840 what he had done risked driving the country toward catastrophe
2819841 he was acting like a dictator like somebody who wants to ruin the nation
2819842 we told him thats not the way to do things the military chiefs have arms and munitions they have men under their command they are responsible for securing the country and you cannot just fire them all like that
2819843 we are a moderate muslim country we dont want terrorism here
2819844 but we cant release him now for the security of the country
2819845 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power
2819846 let me tell you something wax enthusiastic and youll feel so a being causes his own feelings its the joy of creating uh

2819851 nossa moral est no ch o destru da mas n o nada que n o se possa reverter
2819852 em 77 perdi um p nalti no maracan e ouvi todo mundo falar que tinha encerrado minha carreira mas dei a volta por cima e conquistei muitos t tulos eu n o vou desistir essa situa o tem rem dio tem muito trabalho mas tem rem dio
2819853 a conquista dos 32 pontos neste turno est exatamente dentro do que t nhamos planejado muita gente acha que o vit ria foi al m do que poderia mas eu tenho certeza que temos muito ainda para dar e proporcionaremos ainda mais alegrias aos torcedores no segundo turno
2819854 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2819855 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2819856 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2819857 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2819858 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2819859 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2819860 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2819861 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
2819862 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
2819863 im so glad you eventually reinforced my narrow view of china as a dirty country filled with poor people
2819864 shanghai isnt the real china you need to go to x little town to see real chinese
2819865 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
2819866 we chinese chose our way to forge forward please respect that first and die
2819867 below are some highlights of the nearly 4 hour performance
2819868 get a life look around you and what are you doing to make it better
2819869 i really surprised to see the ceremony how u chinese people spent us 1 400 billion in only 1 day as the world is in worst food crises
2819870 a great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men
2819871 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
2819872 posted by a chinese august 9 08 01 14 am
2819873 a great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men
2819874 how can we see something true when the chinese government does not support a free and open press to show us the true things
2819875 sure china will come up with a sparkling show that will divert everyone from the problems they are having
2819876 you guys develop too fast and you are using our resources
2819877 its a shame the chinese government is supporting the genocide in dar fur
2819878 how do you say in chinese b o r i n g
2819879 its amazing that these same people slaughtered 51 million of their own in the 1950s and rule over their own people now with a sledge hammer free tibet
2819880 there has been no progress towards fulfilling these promises only continued deterioration
2819881 the authorities have used the olympic games as pretext to continue and in some respects intensify existing policies and practices which have led to serious and widespread violations of human rights
2819882 china really needs to be releasing human rights activists in order to be showing its following through with its promises
2819883 sending a message that it is acceptable for a government to host the olympic games in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution
2819884 china is the last country on earth barring myanmar that deserved to be selected to host the olympics shame the ioc didnt wait until the chinese authorities learned to behave in a civilized fashion towards all of their people spectacular display however albeit the soulless regimentation comes over as a bit creepy i wonder how many walmart sweatshop workers got to see it
2819885 you have the right to keep yourself away from any made in china goods and i strongly encourage you to do so if you cant do that just shut your mouth up
2819886 you can do anything you set your mind to when you have vision determination and an endless supply of expendable labor
2819887 wow not a single latino white or black face in the ceremony is diversity a strength as so many pandering politicians parrot as often as possible or is it a neutral ask the chinese would the opening ceremony in beijing have been better if every single performer didnt look just like every other
2819888 even if the last picture is showing a typical family in china what i can see is the spirit in the childrens eyes their joy and pride after watching such an impressive ceremony hosted by their own country
2819889 hey kids cant you read this one is for colored thats for white only thats the one you should use
2819890 boykott og in nations like china its a dictatorship no real human rights
2819891 its a pleasure to welcome friends from far away we chinese ppl welcome all friends from all over the world to come visit china
2819892 let us love one another for love is god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love
2819893 im one of those women who didnt think id ever get married

2819900 what is the of all the people that i consider my peers in athleticism the main conundrum they share is that they want to exercise all the time and have a hard time reining it in
2819901 i dont think youll like me for who i am so im going to try to buy your attention and affection
2819902 no i dont wanna go to your hose and i dont wanna go in your house either

2819905 its like when ur moms a bitch cuz she wont let go to the party and um u yell a lot and you say i hate you and you use the word fuck sometimes and then you go in your room and cry like a little bitch
2819906 oh dear martin i had drama today my mother would not let me attend a social gathering my companions had planned
2819907 i used the word fuck a few times i told her i hated her and then cried little bitch cuz thats what drama means to feel frustrated and angry and super duper sad to the point where bitch like tears come streaming down my eyes
2819908 hes a great kid and were really glad to see him back we think he can carry the ball as well as play fullback
2819909 obviously we want him to protect the football but he can go were going to give him a look and see if he can add a dimension to our return game
2819910 the one glaring thing that im not happy with is the number of times that the ball was on the ground ball security is a must well work on that i promise you
2819911 it felt great to get my first nfl sack even if it was in preseason
2819912 he had 14 sacks one year at washington state he has some natural rush ability
2819913 we told him when we signed him if harvey signs hed be gone in one day hes done a nice job taking advantage of the opportunity
2819914 weve had undrafted college free agents make our football team its true competition

2819921 we have a special plan for independence its a peaceful plan we will turn to russia to the cis leadership and international organisations to defend our right to independence we understand that we will have to overcome a lot of obstacles
2819922 we resulted from the democratic disintegration of the soviet union we took part in referendums and our nations expressed their will we all acted in accordance with international law
2819923 these conflicts have many things in common separation from the state military conflict ethnic cleansing from both sides and populations that want independence it is hopeless to force kosovars to live in serbia but it is also hopeless to force abkhaz people for instance to live in georgia so the first get special treatment while the others are sent to negotiate with saakashvili
2819924 personality is always the tri compromission between time sistuation and reflection
2819925 we need a forum within the party where we can debate our long term constitutional aim its difficult for the party leadership to focus on the goal of independence because its not seen as relevant to the current state of wales political development
2819926 one day however the time will come when we do have to focus on that question and we need to debate within the party what an independent wales would look like
2819927 we also need to create a new generation of nationalists the majority of people joining plaid are enthused by a passion for wales to become a full nation an independent state the independence initiative will provide a forum where ideas can be developed and articles published
2819928 there wont be a separate membership and of course people will be encouraged to take part in the wider activities of the party
2819929 the message we need to get across is that wales is only being held back by a lack of self confidence many younger people do have that confidence and that is what we need to tap into
2819930 iceland with the population of cardiff has achieved a very impressive economic growth rate of 10 thanks to an imaginative use of the tools and resources available to it
2819931 it has developed a lucrative tourism industry and is a world leader in bioinfomatics using genetic memory to diagnose health conditions
2819932 in a world of global markets that is no longer the case
2819933 another reason small nations do very well is because they dont tend to be riddled with the kind of class tensions that exist in bigger countries
2819934 i strongly believe that wales has been held back its possible to argue that weve been in economic decline as a nation for over 80 years since the slump in the price of coal in 1924
2819935 sometimes people use the argument that were too poor to be independent instead we should turn the question round and ask why we are so poor and what can we do about it theres nothing in our genes that makes us incapable of running our own affairs effectively and i am convinced that if we had the economic tools available to us that come with independence we could create a more prosperous self confident wales
2819936 principally we show that air pollution as measured by particulate matter in smoke or pm10 does affect the health of boys who have problems with asthma although the health impact isnt great there were small decreases in lung function during very high pollution days for boys with asthma
2819937 the majority of students on the other hand who didnt have respiratory problems were not affected however all students coughed slightly more on high pollution nights
2819938 this is the first time that this urine test has been used to detect exposure to wood smoke pollution in new zealand
2819939 another important result which contradicts an urban myth is that you cannot escape the health effects of air pollution by going inside and slamming the door indoors is just as polluted as outdoors
2819940 our tests show there is very little difference in the concentrations of pm10 pm2 5 and pm1 particulates between indoors and outdoors contrary to many peoples belief
2819941 essentially pollution reaches peoples lungs even if they stay inside on high pollution days there is no escape from wood smoke pollution particularly in older wooden houses during winter temperature inversions in christchurch or anywhere else
2819942 they were really enthusiastic and supportive which made the project much easier to co ordinate
2819943 while the focus of tb control is on prompt case detection and effective treatment better housing conditions and reduced levels of crowding also have a role in controlling the spread of this disease
2819944 unlike some previous studies we were able to control for the effects of known risk factors notably poverty and migration from high incidence countries linking to census data also allowed us to include a relatively large number of cases
2819945 the finding that tb rates are associated with crowded living conditions fits with what we know about the transmission of this bacteria via small airborne droplets
