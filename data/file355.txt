3550000 i find it funny that all of these people are commenting on me saying im a terrible role model and yet none of them have ever been into my classroom and watched me teach and see how i interact with the kids
3550001 our collaboration with amd is especially important to us because it provides us with early access to some of the latest graphics technology
3550002 delivering a polished game experience is one of our top priorities and this relationship helps us achieve that goal for blizzard gamers who choose amd graphics cards
3550003 we are more than happy for two other agents to find another contract for nigel
3550004 nigel feels he has done everything he can in the nrl and would like to pursue his options in french rugby japan also remains an option
3550005 weve sat down and talked with nigel every step of the way over the last few months about his future nigel has had a lot of problems with injuries this season and he has been undecided about what he wants to do
3550006 if he decides to retire we will try to get him a position with the club working with the clubs polynesian players its up to nigel to make a decision
3550007 i remember my first rugby test i ever saw was in 1956 at lancaster park when the springboks played the all blacks
3550008 in 1949 it was a clean sweep in south africa 4 nil to the springboks and the country was in mourning they had to resurrect the game in new zealand and they managed to win the next series 3 1 that was in 1956 and everyone was happy again
3550009 its the number one rugby match up in the world we can say that because there are south africans and kiwis sitting here
3550010 if there were english and french they would say we are arrogant but thats our background and thats how weve been brought up in new zealand and i imagine its the same in south africa
3550011 in new zealand they call that rotation i call it commonsense
3550012 we arent looking to change for changes sake we are looking to put the best side on the field
3550013 hes a great player hes the best halfback in the world thats just my view but he is a great player
3550014 see i am unarmed so you may safely let me approach
3550015 i see the deity in us both and bow before him or her i acknowledge the holiness of even this mundane meeting i cannot separate that which is spiritual in us from that which is human and ordinary
3550016 when i was 12 or 13 years old she had told me that in 18th century japan the geisha who were known for their beauty and their porcelain skin needed something to remove all the heavy make up they wore
3550017 at the time the make up contained lead which was very damaging to their skin
3550018 so they tried everything to take it off and nothing worked and then they tried the nightingale droppings and it not only worked but it left their skin smooth
3550019 when i explain to my customers they think i misspoke because of my accent
3550020 but after they understand many of them are willing to trust me and give it a try
3550021 she e mailed me some information i definitely needed to know more before i committed to the procedure
3550022 but then i thought about it and the japanese have been doing it for such a long time and the geishas have such beautiful skin even though they put such harsh chemicals on it
3550023 it doesnt feel as abrasive as some other facials and it smells organic
3550024 and it doesnt tingle or burn it just sort of stays there its a really simple calming facial
3550025 gt mccain vs hussein on iraq iran and the global war on terror
3550026 this is the first that ive heard of a robbery suspect killing himself as he is drawing a gun out of his waist band
3550027 the criminal evidence points to that it certainly isnt common
3550028 minus jem not many other organizations have cohesive command and control
3550029 say theyre fighting of the poor people of darfur and yet what have they done to show even interest to go to the conference table
3550030 they will have to end on the negotiation table because militarily its clear that no side can win the war in darfur
3550031 im not in any way saying the government is clean but the other side is not a saint
3550032 if we have helicopters both parties will interact with us in a different pattern
3550033 pushing us into a boxing ring and tying our hand behind our backs and want us to box and tomorrow when we dont box properly you blame us
3550034 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
3550035 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting lineup
3550036 conrad jantjes is on present form the no 1 fullback it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100 th test cap
3550037 this creates questions about where we are heading i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3550038 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of
3550039 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
3550040 is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans
3550041 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate
3550042 its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
3550043 the judge confirmed that ebay acted diligently when it received letters from loreal
3550044 what is up with all the blogs i visit constantly crossing paths not that i mind
3550045 if they were actually hiding something important you hope they would do a better ps job than that

3550048 its nice that we have a place like boingboing for these highbrow conversations eh

3550051 what happened was that during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked as to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
3550052 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture however some european media did not see it as such
3550053 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
3550054 spanish sports poor reputation for insensitivity towards racial issues has been further harmed by the advert
3550055 ad was unlikely to go down well with olympics hosts china and could well spoil spains hopes of hosting the olympic games in madrid in 2016 or 2020
3550056 political problems prevented an agreement at that moment on that issue
3550057 my impression was that if we had four or five more days in geneva we would solve that problem
3550058 its 1 5 billion in losses just since july so it shows that these debt instruments continue to decline in value there are still some pressures there
3550059 far from western involvement being the solution in georgia there has already been far too much of it
3550060 blog event started way back in the wintry depths of february by naomi of
3550061 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3550062 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3550063 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3550064 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3550065 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3550066 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3550067 the governments scheme just wont work and i wasnt prepared to risk putting up fuel prices on the basis of overwhelming evidence
3550068 moving tanks and troops through the separatist enclave of south ossetia and advancing toward the city of gori in central georgia

3550073 silicon valleys first phone company for providing a platform for adding voice to web applications bt has already converted its infrastructure to internet protocol while others are expected to follow
3550074 the next big thing in im is to add voice and video she said
3550075 the dutch have the worst beer heineken but sell it all over the world belgians make far better beer and it is barely exported those dutch could sell a fridge to an eskimo the first thing the dutch ask you is about money how much people make and how much things cost which is taboo here in belgium
3550076 yes we have caught the man who was responsible but hes dead cuz he killed himself
3550077 mccains claim to have a handle on national security could be slightly undermined by mispronouncing the name of georgian president mikhail saakashvili three times
3550078 i wonder about those people who create these emails do they think that the rest of us dont know how to use a computer to check these lies
3550079 it is interesting to me that the sender of this email claims to be christian have they forgetten the eighth commandment thou shalt not bear false witness
3550080 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers

3550086 hinckley and surrounding areas are very rednecky small town with not much to do and i have to agree with the person that said something about being a white trash area i was in pine city one day and i could not believe how redneck some of those people were there is a dirty lake called cross lake right in town and a bunch of redneck boats floating in the dirty lake it is a weird area

3550092 i would be concerned if we had no ipos and we had a big falloff on the companies entering the pipeline grabow said
3550093 many factors from high market volatility the slowdown in the world economy sustained high oil prices and overall uncertainty all combined to weaken the ipo pipeline for the second quarter
3550094 market performance needs to stabilize for at least a quarter before we hope to see stronger ipo pipeline activity
3550095 once the markets have stabilized we think there are a lot of companies out there that would like to enter that pipeline and start that process
3550096 thats what the bringing them home report said and thats what we will be continuing to support or re introduce into the senate in an amended bill that provides for financial compensation to the stolen generations
3550097 the different states have various packages available for some forms of compensation but it is very limited and there is a great deal of criticism around it
3550098 a lot of indigenous people in the territory believe that despite the fact many of them vote labor labor hasnt done enough in their particular region to justify that vote
3550099 when you consider the names of people like alison anderson and malarndirri mccarthy it makes their chances of entering the ministry even greater
3550100 the fact that we can make it look like a good tropical streetscape i think is really critical
3550101 we need more of that in darwin and weve been losing a lot of it with the high rise stuff thats been going on and a lot of the street interfaces thats being going on with those high rises

3550105 i absolutely love the job ive got viddie vidmar and myself have formed a relationship which is an excellent one over time im very happy here
3550106 were certainly the underdog in this election and i guess a lot of that has to do with the constant leadership instability that the party has displayed over the last four years
3550107 the public tend to want to punish political parties who behave in that way
3550108 ive spent my entire political career in opposition and i can tell you opposition is no fun
3550109 i come from the business community prior to politics where you could actually achieve things every day off the week whereas in opposition its very difficult to achieve anything
3550110 members are telling us that theres a lot of impact
3550111 were even being told by public sector workers in other states that theyve been contacted to pick up work covered by bans here so not being done during this industrial action
3550112 a few of the bans were around delaying the processing of invoices so they would just be waiting until the action were lifted and then they would go out
3550113 liquidity is sucked out of the debtor in a way that it becomes hard to survive
3550114 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3550115 youll have to forgive me for being an eisenhower republican
3550116 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
3550117 triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political
3550118 a ny activity that may be reasonably viewed as directly or indirectly associating the department of defense with a partisan political activity
3550119 we saw troops everywhere we went on the congressional delegation we went out of our way to see those troops
3550120 was canceled after it became clear that campaign staff and the traveling press corps would not be allowed to accompany senator obama
3550121 dont wrestle with pigs you get dirty and besides the pig likes it
3550122 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3550123 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3550124 we were tracking it earlier in that week and we knew that things were escalating
3550125 i can tell you it moved quicker than we anticipated that first day
3550126 i think a lot of what youre asking needs to be ironed out
3550127 some of these little issues are definitely still big questions in this event what was the intent who started it why did they start it and why werent they prepared to defend what they started
3550128 this does not necessarily mean that the us economy is in good shape just that relative to expectations the economy is improving
3550129 dont wrestle with pigs because youll get dirty besides the pig likes it
3550130 the usa is pursuing absolutely different goals and the creation of the great georgia is surely not on its list the republicans neocons cheney and bush organized the provocation to portray russia as a monster on the globe on the threshold of the november elections this plays into the hands of john mccain who openly says that russia s imperial ambition needs to be curbed
3550131 this way or other the usa has used the small country of georgia as a toy
3550132 not only are we waging to illegal and immoral in afghanistan and iraq theyre planning on attacking another country iran and we will not let them do that
3550133 astonishing as it may seem to americans who believe the contention by mr
3550134 u s just as guilty of committing own violent acts
3550135 my primary anger is directed at the leaders of this country
3550136 no more despicable than the massive acts of terrorism the deliberate killing of civilians for political purposes that the u s government has committed in my lifetime
3550137 anyone who can blow up the pentagon would get my vote
3550138 other animals are made of the same stuff human beings are
3550139 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
3550140 liberals like children live in a world of utopian dreaminess clinging to a narrow circumscribed reality and believing that if everyone would just be nice to each other

3550149 if its a funny joke ill laugh but if its just being nasty i dont want us to hear it

3550161 from a future strategy point of view of the port of hobart we feel that its going to be blocked off from any future expansion and in fact it will reduce its capability to be an operational port
3550162 its not good enough just to do the minimum or meet minimum requirements of firing of a letter whilst youre telling all these staff that theyve lost their jobs
3550163 there are processes that can be undertaken to talk through what the issues are the reasons behind the decision and allow people the opportunity and maximise that opportunity for them to find alternative employment
3550164 a number of these workers have been with diners for a substantial period of time
3550165 there had been no notice that this decision was going to be taken and so i think its fair to say that many people were taken aback to the point of being quite upset

3550171 it was thought that the case management system needed review particularly at the caseloads which were being carried by case managers
3550172 it was also seen to be necessary to give clients better information about the services that they could contact in the case of crisis
3550173 i think its probably been a good thing overall because it has extended services for the seriously mentally ill to a larger proportion of the tasmanian population
3550174 people have already left the region the economic and social ramifications are considerable
3550175 theres no doubt that the government needs to act with a greater degree of urgency
3550176 we will welcome if appropriate an injection of financial assistance thats actually going to deliver some positive outcomes but were already very concerned that damage has been done in the six weeks that this government has been sitting back idly
3550177 what the governments done here is to try to ensure some regularity i think across the south east queensland region in this probably one term before the new distribution company is formed in 2010
3550178 i think were just about at crisis point now well weve had a lot of ministers out here and their advisers and weve done a lot of work in the area proving basically that theres no other option

3550209 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3550210 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3550211 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3550212 the whole concept of going somewhere where you dont have a place to shelter like the space station was a little different
3550213 its a very low probability of an event but im glad that theres a relatively robust plan to deal with it if it did happen
3550214 i think it will be a pretty special moment for all of us
3550215 every bomb we hope its going to be the last
3550216 they try to support us they understand us they come and say that you know we are really sorry and we are your friends and we are we are
3550217 because we russians remember those days when we were quite friendly i vacationed almost every summer on the black sea in georgia theyre great people so friendly
3550218 i hope intelligent russians are against their government and i think most russian americans support the georgians the russian government will always be the same even if its name changes
3550219 we need the whole country to be saved and all georgians to be alive
3550220 we said people are dying we cant sing and dance here
3550221 in the area where we live those children are 12 miles from school
3550222 thats a long walk what are they going to do
3550223 while school systems are working hard to limit programming cuts the sharp increase in costs will have a negative impact on children especially disadvantaged children unless the states and federal government act quickly to provide relief
3550224 we wouldnt do the four day school week if we had money
3550225 with the state budget the way it is theres just no hope right now

3550326 there are clearly a number of negatives at work in the australian economy but it is important that we recognise there are potentially a number of positive influences
3550327 the balance of these opposing forces favours continued modest economic growth with credit growth not too far below the average of the past decade

3550363 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3550364 the sea ice causes problems for us in terms of observing the ocean in that it makes ship observation very expensive and slow
3550365 satellites cant see the ocean through the ice and the profiling floats we are using throughout the worlds oceans now are also unable to surface through the ice and transmit their data by satellite
3550366 the sea ice is important for climate because it is bright and reflects the suns energy back into space so if we have less sea ice the earth tends to absorb more energy and so warm up
3550367 weve never been able to measure how much sea ice is actually forming before and the seal data is allowing us to do that for the first time
3550368 people in china especially parents and college students are suddenly becoming aware of huge depression and anxiety problems in young people
3550369 in this generation every child is raised to be at the top
3550370 theyve worked hard for it and its what their parents have focused their lives on but the problem is that the country cant provide the lifestyle they feel they deserve only a few will get it
3550371 he might not focus as much on class if his parent wasnt there

3550377 the media report on new campus suicides all the time
3550378 in this generation every child is raised to be at the top
3550379 theyve worked hard for it and its what their parents have focused their lives on but the problem is that the country cant provide the lifestyle they feel they deserve only a few will get it
3550380 because of the cultural revolution my parents literally wasted 10 years
3550381 i was explicitly told that they had lost a lot in their lives so they wanted me to get it back for them
3550382 in china the term for a one child family is a risky family
3550383 if something happened to that child it would be a disaster so from the parents point of view the spoiling is all necessary to protect them
3550384 does this mean everything i have would have to be cut in half or shared no i dont want that
3550385 the only way only children are reliably different from others is they score slightly higher in academic achievement
3550386 pinning their problems on having no siblings is really making them a scapegoat
3550387 these kids have the same dreams as all middle class kids to go to college to get white collar jobs to own their own home to have nikes and name brands
3550388 they expect things that are normal in developed countries but by chinas standards are unheard of
3550389 it was after they got a bad grade on a test
3550390 they think to die is better than to have that bad mark
3550391 that one grade becomes the only standard to justify you as a person
3550392 if you have a good personality or maybe youre good in math but not chinese all of that is your downfall because its all about your grade
3550393 but all the other students do the extra homework so if you do not do it you will lag behind
3550394 with the click of a button they go from a 19 year old with no social life to a great warrior in world of warcraft
3550395 why bother doing things in the real world when they can be in this game and be fulfilled
3550396 they have trouble adjusting to the idea that theyre going to be working class
3550397 its not like american universities where you have many friends
3550398 at chinese universities you compete for limited resources and everyone is concerned about themselves and if you wanted to talk to your parents they wouldnt understand when they were your age they were reading maos little red book
3550399 in the 20th century the term depression didnt even exist in china
3550400 it couldnt be talked about because there was no vocabulary for it yet
3550401 back then every mental problem was seen as anti socialist
3550402 if you were depressed they thought you were politically impure and sent you to a labor camp
3550403 people in china have more knowledge about mental health today
3550404 now there are books and popular magazines about it and the training infrastructure gets better all the time

3550414 we just want to add another dimension to the show and would love the town to get more involved such as the chamber of commerce
3550415 as a teacher it disappoints me that large numbers of young people who would like to stay in the area cant find jobs here i think we need to be very pro active in finding new types of business perhaps ones that wont be affected as much by distance such as e businesses
3550416 lots of council areas around are aggressively marketing themselves and i would like to find some niche markets and help us to be more assertive in our market share

3550446 the farmhands asked should we weed out the thistles 29 he said no if you weed the thistles youll pull up the wheat too
3550447 gods kingdom is like a pine nut that a farmer plants 32 it is quite small as seeds go but in the course of years it grows into a huge pine tree and eagles build nests in it
3550448 gods kingdom is like yeast that a woman works into the dough for dozens of loaves of barley bread and waits while the dough rises

3550512 since you are gods son speak the word that will turn these stones into loaves of bread

3550517 we found that the oil and gas blocks overlap perfectly with the most biodiverse part of the amazon for birds mammals and amphibians
3550518 the threat to amphibians is of particular concern because they are already the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide
3550519 the most dynamic situation is unfolding in the peruvian amazon
3550520 the elimination of new oil access roads could significantly reduce the impacts of most projects
3550521 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3550522 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognize that indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3550523 filling up with a tank of gas could soon have devastating consequences to rainforests their peoples and their species
3550524 quiero aclarar que en ning n momento ni el gobierno nacional ni evo personalmente se han comprometido a construir un nuevo estadio en el departamento de la paz

3550531 we know that wind energy can and must play a critical role in securing our future needs
3550532 but our review of wind energy in the country finds that there is an urgent need to reassess the current policies and incentives so that the business of wind gets serious about generating power and not just installing wind farms and reaping benefits from fiscal incentives
3550533 in the current scheme which gives an accelerated depreciation benefit of 80 per cent and other tax incentives for installation of the plants wind energy has become the business of cash rich investors who take advantage of tax benefits and are not serious about generation of power
3550534 the current business is not geared to generation of power and increasing efficiencies and reducing costs this is clearly not good if we want wind energy to play an important role in our future energy security
3550535 the indian wind energy sector needs to be re energised and for that to happen policy needs to change and get real
3550536 too little too inadequate and too hesitant to change the business as it operates currently
3550537 rabbi we all know youre a teacher straight from god no one could do all the god pointing god revealing acts you do if god werent in on it

3550545 pray for me pray to the master that nothing like that will ever happen to me
3550546 all attempts to get rid of this have sprung from doctrinal prejudices
3550547 we are to understand christ as he expected his auditor to understand him john the baptist baptized both jew and gentile as a sign of purification by repentance from past sins nicodemus would then have certainly understood by the expression born of water a reference to this rite of baptism
3550548 let the children alone dont prevent them from coming to me gods kingdom is made up of people like these

3550553 do you have any idea how difficult it is for the rich to enter gods kingdom 24 let me tell you its easier to gallop a camel through a needles eye than for the rich to enter gods kingdom
3550554 no chance at all if you think you can pull it off yourself every chance in the world if you trust
3550555 we left everything and followed you what do we get out of it
3550556 yes you have followed me in the re creation of the world when the son of man will rule gloriously you who have followed me will also rule starting with the twelve tribes of israel
3550557 take care protect yourself against the least bit of greed life is not defined by what you have even when you have a lot
3550558 the farm of a certain rich man produced a terrific crop 17 he talked to himself what can i do my barn isnt big enough for this harvest 18 then he said heres what ill do ill tear down my barns and build bigger ones slide 20 to enter god s kingdom then ill gather in all my grain and goods 19 and ill say to myself self youve done well youve got it made and can now retire take it easy and have the time of your life slide 21 to enter god s kingdom 20 just then god showed up and said fool tonight you die and your barnful of goods who gets it 21 thats what happens when you fill your barn with self and not with god
3550559 dont fuss about whats on the table at mealtimes or if the clothes in your closet are in fashion
3550560 what im trying to do here is get you to relax not be so preoccupied with getting so you can respond to gods giving 30 people who dont know god and the way he works fuss over these things but you know both god and how he works
3550561 you know that if the house owner had known what night the burglar was coming he wouldnt have stayed out late and left the place unlocked 40 so dont you be slovenly and careless just when you dont expect him the son of man will show up
3550562 master are you telling this story just for us or is it for everybody
3550563 let me ask you who is the dependable manager full of common sense that the master puts in charge of his staff to feed them well and on time
3550564 the servant who knows what his master wants and ignores it or insolently does whatever he pleases will be thoroughly thrashed 48 but if he does a poor job through ignorance hell get off with a slap on the hand great gifts mean great responsibilities greater gifts greater responsibilities
3550565 when you see clouds coming in from the west you say storms coming and youre right 55 and when the wind comes out of the south you say thisll be a hot one and youre right slide 43 to enter god s kingdom 56 frauds you know how to tell a change in the weather so dont tell me you cant tell a change in the season the god season were in right now 57 you dont have to be a genius to understand these things slide 44 to enter god s kingdom just use your common sense 58 the kind youd use if while being taken to court you decided to settle up with your accuser on the way knowing that if the case went to the judge youd probably go to jail 59 and pay every last penny of the fine thats the kind of decision im asking you to make
3550566 mary you have nothing to fear god has a surprise for you 31 you will become pregnant and give birth to a son and call his name jesus 32 he will be great be called son of the highest the lord god will give him the throne of his father david 33 he will rule jacobs house forever no end ever to his kingdom

3550577 why wasnt this oil sold and the money given to the poor it would have easily brought three hundred silver pieces
3550578 let her alone shes anticipating and honoring the day of my burial slide 5 anointing his feet it was usual to embalm the dead with ointments and spices christ suggests that the time of his death and burial were nigh and that this woman had kept this ointment till now for such a purpose and whereas she would not be able to make use of it at the time of his interment she had embalmed his body with it now beforehand gill slide 6 anointing his feet 8 you always have the poor with you this is a quote from deuteronomy 15 11 cev there will always be some israelites who are poor and needy thats why i am commanding you to be generous with them jesus does not discredit gifts to the poor at all but there is relativity in one s duties rwp slide 7 anointing his feet you dont always have me
3550579 sir we want to see jesus can you help us
3550580 times up the time has come for the son of man to be glorified by rising from the dead ascending to heaven sitting at the right hand of god and from thence pouring forth the spirit upon his disciples
3550581 the voice didnt come for me but for you he had already won the victory before the voice came it was rather to confirm the faith of his disciples who still stumbled over the prospect of his death pnt
3550582 we heard from gods law that the messiah lasts forever how can it be necessary as you put it that the son of man be lifted up who is this son of man
3550583 for a brief time still the light is among you walk by the light you have so darkness doesnt destroy you if you walk in darkness you dont know where youre going slide 31 i am lifted up he refuses to answer their questions directly but imparts to them needed truths the light was then present with them let them seek the light and walk in it while they had opportunity the opportunity might soon pass away and the darkness come pnt slide 32 i am lifted up 36 as you have the light believe in the light then the light will be within you and shining through your lives youll be children of light

3550589 im going to get them into the lineup whether its for fukudome or anybody else
3550590 they need to play too theyve done a nice job here
3550591 were pulling for him ive never said i was disappointed all ive said basically was that wed like to see him start hitting and it created a stir
3550592 to his credit hes continued to hustle and hes played really well in right field hes just in a little bit of a slump probably trying to do too much
3550593 he needs just to do the things that hes capable of like he was earlier in the year hes taking less pitches hes not working the count the way he was earlier he just needs to swing at more strikes
3550594 you try to find somebody else thats swinging the bat
3550595 it created a stir and if thats the case im sorry
3550596 and you know what he probably is but i think we give him one more and then we put him back into the closers role
3550597 maybe if you ask me in a week i could tell you everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing
3550598 probably left also but hes used to the right side if we moved cordy to a right tackle we could move kiante tripp over to left tackle i would say that would exhaust the possibilities
3550599 i think just watching cordy it didnt take long at all to say he can do it physically this year
3550600 the question is how quickly can he learn hes been running with the no 1 unit for a few days now at guard
3550601 to know the backside of your qb is protected and to know that he understands what to do is critical
3550602 hes just bigger stronger and more experienced than he was a year ago and he did a pretty good job a year ago its sad for him of course because he worked so hard he got up to the 310 pound range and was as strong as hes ever been was practicing so well its hard to lose experience
3550603 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3550604 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3550605 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3550606 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3550607 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3550608 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3550609 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3550610 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3550611 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3550612 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3550613 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3550614 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3550615 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3550616 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3550617 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3550618 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3550619 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3550620 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3550621 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3550622 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3550623 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3550624 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3550625 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3550626 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3550627 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3550628 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3550629 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3550630 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3550631 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3550632 i think it would be a powerful statement if the members of algore com helped put barack obama over the 2 000 000 donor mark
3550633 i ever only had one car because the other was a government jag
3550634 kinnock said you cant be transport minister and drive a jag

3550637 i said gordon brown is the right man for the job at the end of the day they believed in those times that that ship could never sink the captain still had a responsibility but the thing that actually sank it was the iceberg the challenge is how do you navigate around it
3550638 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3550639 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3550640 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3550641 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3550642 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3550643 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3550644 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3550645 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3550646 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3550647 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3550648 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3550649 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3550650 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3550651 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3550652 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3550653 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3550654 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3550655 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3550656 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3550657 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3550658 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3550659 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors
3550660 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3550661 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3550662 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3550663 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3550664 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3550665 its better that the us do the drilling than china or cuba it will be a lot safer
3550666 he has a voting record to the left of vermont sen bernie sanders and sanders is a socialist
3550667 for me the issue is israel with obama you get louis farrakhan and rev jeremiah wright coming in the back door to the white house
3550668 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3550669 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3550670 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3550671 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3550672 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3550673 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3550674 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3550675 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3550676 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3550677 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3550678 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3550679 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3550680 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3550681 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3550682 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3550683 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3550684 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3550685 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3550686 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3550687 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3550688 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3550689 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3550690 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3550691 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3550692 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3550693 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3550694 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3550695 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore

3550698 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3550699 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person

3550714 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3550715 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3550716 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore

3550725 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3550726 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3550727 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3550728 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3550729 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3550730 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3550731 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3550732 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3550733 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3550734 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3550735 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3550736 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3550737 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3550738 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3550739 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3550740 if this actually works it will make everyone feel good but well have to give it back
3550741 imagine how canadians would feel if a bunch of americans passed the hat for stephen harper
3550742 does anyone believe that it is possible to win the nomination without over these next two months raising all these issues on him
3550743 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3550744 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light lets explicitly own american he obama doesnt lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3550745 the constitution in crisis the downing street minutes and deception manipulation torture retribution cover ups in the iraq war and illegal domestic surveillance
3550746 when once a republic is corrupted there is no possibility of remedying any of the growing evils but by removing the corruption and restoring its lost principles
3550747 scare us by telling us that if we dont give them unlimited power over us we risk being killed by terrorists
3550748 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3550749 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3550750 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3550751 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3550752 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3550753 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3550754 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3550755 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3550756 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3550757 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3550758 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3550759 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3550760 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3550761 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3550762 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3550763 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3550764 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3550765 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3550766 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3550767 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3550768 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3550769 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3550770 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3550771 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3550772 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3550773 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
3550774 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
3550775 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
3550776 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
3550777 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3550778 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3550779 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3550780 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3550781 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3550782 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3550783 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3550784 just so you all know we did set a record
3550785 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3550786 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3550787 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3550788 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3550789 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3550790 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3550791 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3550792 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3550793 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3550794 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3550795 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3550796 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3550797 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3550798 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3550799 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3550800 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3550801 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3550802 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3550803 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3550804 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3550805 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3550806 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3550807 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3550808 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3550809 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3550810 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3550811 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3550812 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3550813 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3550814 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3550815 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3550816 s dan er det bare 10eren er lukket i dag
3550817 im having a belvedere in your honour the mountains are fantastic fabulous colours in the high desert will say hi at pasquals for you
3550818 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3550819 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3550820 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3550821 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3550822 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3550823 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3550824 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3550825 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3550826 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october
3550827 hey you got sms in australia we want to text you on the vp the moment barack makes his decision as we told our troops
3550828 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby
3550829 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3550830 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3550831 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3550832 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3550833 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3550834 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3550835 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3550836 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3550837 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3550838 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3550839 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3550840 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3550841 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3550842 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3550843 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3550844 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3550845 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3550846 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3550847 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3550848 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3550849 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3550850 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3550851 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3550852 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3550853 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3550854 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3550855 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3550856 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3550857 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3550858 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3550859 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3550860 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3550861 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3550862 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3550863 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3550864 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3550865 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3550866 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3550867 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3550868 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3550869 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3550870 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3550871 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3550872 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3550873 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3550874 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3550875 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3550876 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3550877 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3550878 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3550879 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3550880 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3550881 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3550882 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3550883 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
3550884 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
3550885 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3550886 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3550887 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3550888 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3550889 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3550890 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3550891 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3550892 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3550893 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3550894 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3550895 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3550896 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3550897 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3550898 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3550899 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3550900 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3550901 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3550902 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3550903 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3550904 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3550905 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3550906 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3550907 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3550908 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3550909 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3550910 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3550911 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3550912 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3550913 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3550914 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3550915 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3550916 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3550917 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3550918 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3550919 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3550920 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3550921 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3550922 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3550923 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3550924 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3550925 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3550926 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3550927 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3550928 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3550929 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3550930 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
3550931 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
3550932 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
3550933 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
3550934 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
3550935 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
3550936 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
3550937 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
3550938 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
3550939 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
3550940 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
3550941 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
3550942 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
3550943 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
3550944 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
3550945 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3550946 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3550947 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3550948 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3550949 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3550950 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night

3550952 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3550953 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3550954 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3550955 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
3550956 would not be in the best interest of the community

3551027 muslim americans are a highly diverse population one largely comprised of immigrants
3551028 nonetheless they are decidedly american in their outlook values and attitudes overwhelmingly they believe that hard work pays off in this society
3551029 the survey shows that although many muslims are relative newcomers to the u s they are highly assimilated into american society
3551030 with the exception of very recent immigrants most report that a large proportion of their closest friends are non muslim and by nearly 2 to 1 63 percent 32 percent muslim americans do not see a conflict between being a devout muslim and living in a modern society
3551031 very few muslim americans just 1 percent say that suicide bombings against civilian targets are often justified to defend islam an additional 7 percent say suicide bombings are sometimes justified in these circumstances
3551032 overall just 5 percent of muslim americans express even somewhat favorable opinions of al qaeda
3551033 while 73 percent say they have never experienced discrimination while living in this country
3551034 when asked about their general outlook on politics 38 percent of muslim americans describe their political views as moderate a quarter describe themselves as liberal while 19 percent describe themselves as conservative
3551035 muslim americans hold liberal political views on questions about the size and scope of government
3551036 at the same time however they are socially conservative and supportive of a strong role for government in protecting morality

3551067 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan

3551069 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3551070 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3551071 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3551072 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3551073 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3551074 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3551075 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3551076 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3551077 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3551078 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3551079 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3551080 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3551081 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3551082 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3551083 boo hoo you know everything is bad in my life

3551120 forever more demonstrates this idea of writing songs in a diverse fashion the title track is one of our deeper cuts complete with heavy lyrics de tuned riffs and acoustic interludes while i wanna live is one of our more uplifting songs that bounces musically and delivers a lyrical message that suggests living life to the fullest

3551145 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3551146 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3551147 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3551148 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
3551149 ms brown is it possible you have a history of perceiving things entirely different than they really happened

3551151 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation
3551152 he said it would be selfish because it wasnt something his family could enjoy with him
3551153 he knew the dangers and he knew what he was doing was important
3551154 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3551155 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3551156 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3551157 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3551158 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3551159 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3551160 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
3551161 ms brown is it possible you have a history of perceiving things entirely different than they really happened

3551164 it really is one of the last vestiges of the roaring 20s
3551165 it was a place where people could enjoy gondola rides and illicit booze and ogle chorus girls
3551166 people still went but money was in really short supply
3551167 it really is one of the last vestiges of the roaring 20s
3551168 it was a place where people could enjoy gondola rides and illicit booze and ogle chorus girls
3551169 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3551170 anybody who tells you they know when the housing market will bottom is delusional but anybody who denies there are some positives out there that could make the housing market bottom fairly soon is equally delusional
3551171 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3551172 california is the linchpin and so if the region flattens that changes everything
3551173 the data came in much better than we were expecting and much better than the market was expecting
3551174 i think a lot of the increase has to do with foreclosure sales which are selling at a quicker pace and have a faster turnaround time
3551175 housing market data is certainly showing early signs of stabilization on the activity side and home price side
3551176 we are not at the end of tunnel yet but more indicators are starting to look as if we are at least getting closer to it

3551181 you sound so angry just calm down you found me
3551182 the reason i stopped you is because of the crosswalk violation back there
3551183 i just saw yep i was seeing my girlfriend went by and i honked at her
3551184 the reason i stopped you is failure to yield to the pedestrian who was stepping out there
3551185 yeah i didnt see him until i was like already past him
3551186 seventy five dollar fine and if you hit somebody its a misdemeanor
3551187 if you see somebody in the crosswalk see somebody crossing the road for heavens sake stop for them

3551189 i went down and talked to buch told him what were doing
3551190 the reason i did it is i didnt want to come out here and talk to you before i talked to buch
3551191 by no means are we giving up on clay buchholz far from it
3551192 but that said this move for byrd gives us the freedom to do the right thing in our rotation rather than forcing people into roles because of injuries well see how things shake out but by no means is clay buchholz out of our big picture
3551193 hes ok theres a lot of reasons why you invest in young kids in the big leagues hes not a quitter things arent going as smoothly as youd want them to things are going to get better
3551194 hes one of the finest professionals that ive had the privilege to work with
3551195 when you talk about a raven a guy who is physical competitive and wants to win one of the first guys i thought of was lorenzo neal hes going to be a great complement to leron mcclain
3551196 thats not something were going to do in an emergency with willis situation it helps us it gives us some depth that we didnt have
3551197 we obviously dont have a lot of pop in the lineup
3551198 it doesnt mean we cant win ballgames yesterday guys were sitting around saying we might not win another ballgame all year i was like forget that im winning five more i dont care what the lineup looks like to me im thinking about every fifth day i dont care if a little league team is playing behind me im still going to throw and try to win every night
3551199 they werent going to give him 100 million he said he was looking for 120 million theyre not willing to go out on a limb that far
3551200 its difficult but i also think were all used to the game itself
3551201 thats part of it its not very often during the course of a year you see two big names like that from one team get traded
3551202 we dont have a whole bunch of veterans among the everyday lineup guys most of the veterans left here are pitchers
3551203 youre always hoping this is it you never know if youve been in this game long enough you know you cant worry about something thats out of your control its easier said than done of course
3551204 obviously were starting to make moves that are telling us that they pretty much think the season is over
3551205 i figure theyre looking for the future and definitely looking for some guys that they can sign in the offseason i would expect them to go out and spend some money well see
3551206 unless youve been in space or been associated with the people that have been there its really hard to wrap your mind around the concept of being up there
3551207 just looking at the picture its really cool its an honor that they choose my jersey
3551208 we took it out of the locker and wore it had some fun with it up there a little bit
3551209 did some head first slides you slide a lot farther than he can down here because theres less gravity to deal with
3551210 its pretty unique to have a job that has the same title as the team were here watching and that we watch on tv
3551211 its a great testament to the significance of what nasa does theyve got a great team and weve got a great space program so its an awesome opportunity to come to the ballpark
3551212 honestly i want to be somebody special in the future
3551213 maybe it wont happen on this team but id like to pitch in the eighth or ninth inning one day but where they put me im going to do the job because thats the only way you have a job and have a chance to get better everyday
3551214 im a strong pitcher and mentally i am strong i dont let the things that are happening on the field or off the field affect me thats what you need you need to have a good heart a strong heart i think i have that ability if the opportunity ever comes up that i can be a closer ill be ready for it
3551215 again i dont want to stick my neck out saying i want this or i want that
3551216 im not going to say i have to pitch in this inning or that inning i just want to do the job they want me to do i have to focus on the things i can control thats something that has affected me in the past
3551217 he has always had the stuff but sometimes it has been the command problems hes getting ahead of hitters and throwing strikes hes come a long way
3551218 last year if i thought i had to be in this situation or that situation and i wasnt it would get to my head
3551219 i would wonder what was going on and what they were doing to me i would think they didnt like me but now thanks to eddie i understand what i have to do
3551220 francisco has a big heart and thats what i look at i dont just look at the ballplayer
3551221 francisco was a guy that just needed a little guidance you just try to make this game as simple as possible and the most important thing is when you play this game you want to succeed but you want to be the best at whatever it is your role is what is going to get you there is your family and whats in your heart i told francisco that and he took off
3551222 chess makes time fly by and it opens your mind
3551223 i dont think it helps you with your problems or situations on the field but it helps you become stronger mentally its like going to school and taking a class that you know is not going to help you in any way other than helping develop your mind
3551224 i can win two three games in a row but he wins and its like he won the world championship
3551225 he talks and talks i play with passion when i play with him to get him off his game we have so much fun
3551226 we feel like well get a good game out of garrett olson tonight and well back him up with jim johnson and george sherrill
3551227 we didnt make a move its that simple we didnt make one
3551228 im more concerned with the starters going longer in the game than i am about making a move
3551229 until im told otherwise or until a decision is made thats what it is the rotation stays the way it is i know ill be discussing that with andy macphail we have a couple of days yet before i have to make a decision on that one if something were to happen
3551230 the candidates and names in the minor leagues are rather obvious
3551231 well have to get through the next couple of games here and see where we go in detroit
3551232 i woke up this morning and it was pretty bad
3551233 i was trying to do a few things to get it loose and ready but i just wasnt able to get it going
3551234 im going to get back up in the clubhouse and let the trainers work on me some more
3551235 well see what he can do as the game goes along
3551236 maybe it can loosen up if we need him late in the ballgame well see if we can put him out there
3551237 it starts in spring training when you start putting everything in place
3551238 once youve evaluated your bullpen and made decisions on the roles you can create down there you want to keep them in that bubble keep them from wearing down
3551239 you see if theres a role change during the year and make adjustments as you go weve made some minor changes in our pen the most important thing is keeping them in their roles and in their bubble
3551240 butch has done a great job of keeping them sharp
3551241 every day we go over where they are who might need a day if a guys struggling in a role and hes busting his head against the wall you have to make adjustments were seeing it with justin
3551242 guys work their way into a role you rarely see a guy come up and youre putting him right in the back end of the bullpen francisco was very quick to the back end but thats unusual
3551243 you try to build that pyramid up to the closer
3551244 arredondos been a big part of getting that alignment jose doesnt have a lot of experience but his stuff has been electric hes been in every situation and hes done the job
3551245 youre definitely in tune with that every day thats what butch does with bullpen coach orlando mercado and bullpen catcher steve soliz they evaluate how a guys warming up how he looks if hes getting a little fuzzy when a guy needs a rest he needs it that day
3551246 when we get him back hes got to be the guy that has to handle those last three outs
3551247 i know how to play the game i know the situation in the game i thought i saw something but i didnt
3551248 they care about winning and losing they care about helping their teammates and theyre baseball players when youre a baseball player and you do something like that you feel emotional you feel like you hurt the team
3551249 we didnt lose the game because of that but they feel bad because they know that they did that and those are the guys you want
3551250 its been talked about we took care of it and we play tonight
3551251 all those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy peace and understanding for three bucks a hit
3551252 i kissed a girl and i kind of liked it
3551253 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people
3551254 mr tsvangirai won the first round of the presidential election his party the mdc won a parliamentary majority
3551255 whatever happened between the two parties weve no knowledge of it
3551256 the process is on course and a lot of ground has been covered
3551257 there was disagreement on one element of the negotiations by morgan tsvangirai
3551258 you cant just tell someone to get into a scanner and be happy for 30 seconds
3551259 there is a partial overlap if you taste something disgusting see something disgusting or imagine a disgusting scenario theres a common pathway
3551260 this is why books and movies work because they stimulate the area of the brain which is involved in what it really feels like to be disgusted
3551261 thats what the bringing them home report said and thats what we will be continuing to support or re introduce into the senate in an amended bill that provides for financial compensation to the stolen generations
3551262 the different states have various packages available for some forms of compensation but it is very limited and there is a great deal of criticism around it
3551263 the western amazon is pretty much intact and the reason it remains remote is that there are no roads
3551264 thats why we want an immediate moratorium on new road building before any contracts are signed
3551265 it would be a spectacular failure for conservation if it failed
3551266 my heel came to a point where i felt it all day long this time i had to stop
3551267 we dont need to be any more short handed in the bullpen
3551268 if were not going to have the availability of his services theres no sense of keeping him on the active roster but today was a good day for him

3551271 well make sure that qantas responds appropriately that all the maintenance documentation relating to these aircraft has been checked and double checked
3551272 this is why we can put our head up and say that our safety standards are second to none
3551273 the roster affects police and their personal lives it says when youre going to go to work it says how tired youre going to be on a daily basis and how much time youre going to spend with your family
3551274 thats why its an important issue its not simply an operational matter and its not about money its about quality of life for members and their families ends
3551275 i doubt very seriously if ill be giving a speech in prime time
3551276 if you are hanging out with people that get arrested then that is not who you should be hanging out with and if you sit in jail for awhile and think about your choices maybe next time they will be better ones

3551280 we have to adapt to the environmental changes that have already taken place or that we can reasonably expect will occur because of climate change
3551281 the city was built with an assumption of an environmental baseline and climate change in many ways changes that baseline
3551282 some of these transformations can potentially be catastrophic as large storms others might be more subtle and difficult to discern over the short term

3551284 call henderson to schedule time and location for 10 3 presentation
3551285 i dont have any first impressions ill formulate them as i go along
3551286 my hopes for the next six years will be defined by the vision that the people spell out because i want to walk with them my hopes will be their hopes
3551287 it was very important that i be closer to canberra where i am involved in a number of committees im delighted to be here
3551288 i celebrate mass fairly informally but with a real sense of devotion and transcendence
3551289 i will try to discern where people are and then put in place an outward looking vision
3551290 if we are only looking at our own needs well lose it we need to be outward looking it brings enormous benefits to people when they are outward looking
3551291 they are beautiful people and this is a project that is close to home with very important historical links to australia the spin off for both timorese and australians is quite extraordinary
3551292 spurred in part by the judging errors at the 2004 olympics
3551293 shoot for the moon and fail trying versus the safe route
3551294 spurred in part by the judging errors at the 2004 olympics
3551295 id prefer that the mens competition be about power and objective execution of skills and the womens competition be more about grace and more subjective artistic execution
3551296 the declining interest is partly from the perception that scientists dont get rich like lawyers and dentists and stockbrokers
3551297 you forgot the most important thing overhauling the patent system
3551298 but also because science isnt valued in a country full of creationists
3551299 one use your immense buying power to improve the security of commercial products and services one property of technological products is that most of the cost is in the development of the product rather than the production
3551300 gravity explains the motions of the planets but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion god governs all things and knows all that is or can be done
3551301 unfortunately its going to take a catastrophic blow to our critical it infrastructure before someone starts listening
3551302 i dont mean to troll but i see a major hole in your viewpoint that is the idea that personal private information or data has any value
3551303 im still living in hope that one day youll provide a proper analysis of the economic impacts of legislating about software liability on the consumers
3551304 we could argue all day long about whether creationism is pseudo science or not but it might help if we actually used scientific techniques to bash or defend it
3551305 we actually used scientific techniques to bash or defend it
3551306 personally im beginning to think there is no way you can have a secure computing platform which is actually capable of doing anything meaningfull
3551307 seems to me the problem is that you and endiel are lumping different philosophies under one label and then getting mad when people use that label to refer to just one of those philosophies
3551308 banyak sekali rumor berterbangan mengenai saya tapi saya jelaskan bahwasanya saya tidak akan kemana mana dan saya juga tidak mengancam apapun ada banyak tugas di klub city dan saya ingin fokus menjalankannya demi mencapai kesuksesan di lapangan
3551309 tidak ada yang berubah sejak saya datang ke sini baik hubungan dengan gary cook maupun dengan yang lain komunikasi kami baik baik saja dalam membahas kelanjutan klub dan itu dilakukan saban hari
3551310 masa depan city tidak limbung dalam kerangka bisnis ini hal biasa kami tidak hanya tergantung dari uang kekayaan tuan thaksin
3551311 ketika hughes mengambil keputusan membeli pemain kami melakukan proses seperti klub kebanyakan meminjam ke bank atau sumber dana lain
3551312 this time but dont expect it again in the future
3551313 its appalling that cancer patients in england are forced to cut back on basic necessities like food to pay for their urgently needed medication people must never be forced to choose between food or medication the government must act now
3551314 patients should be allowed to focus on getting better instead of worrying how theyre going to find money for prescriptions
3551315 my treatments over but im still struggling im now on statutory sick pay because ive been too unwell to work and quite frankly have barely enough money to live on
3551316 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3551317 realistic about the ability of cities such as manchester leeds and newcastle to regenerate struggling nearby towns such as liverpool bradford and sunderland
3551318 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3551319 you cant get tight jeans off a woman without her cooperation
3551320 and why did he beat me up oh because i was foolish enough to let him do it
3551321 would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body
3551322 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
3551323 upon hearing the explosion as far away as 1000 miles millions of french canadians ran from their homes with their arms in the air in an attempt to surrender to the invading americans when no american soldiers were seen they instead promptly surrendered to varying pakistanis running local 7 11 stores since they were the only other adults available at 3am
3551324 my mother was pushing miguel in his wheelchair while he was coughing up blood into a bowl
3551325 at school we had to play a summer sport i had a mate who did a bit of rowing so i thought ah well ill give it a go
3551326 i loved it from the very first second its the ultimate team sport
3551327 just before i graduated my rowing coach said to me one day youll represent australia at the olympic games i laughed
3551328 the barcelona games were even more special because my father is spanish it was my very first olympics and lastly because they did an outstanding job hosting them
3551329 at the end of the day its disappointing to finish so close but only for a short time when i was standing on the podium with our flag raised and fans singing the national anthem i was filled with pride
3551330 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3551331 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3551332 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3551333 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3551334 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3551335 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3551336 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3551337 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3551338 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3551339 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3551340 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3551341 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3551342 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3551343 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3551344 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3551345 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3551346 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3551347 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3551348 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3551349 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3551350 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3551351 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3551352 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3551353 a lot of people define courage as being out front and in your face
3551354 but bob didnt come out of his picture frame for anybody
3551355 stepped down monday after an internet newsletter wrote about his brief stint on the funds board which also included a fundamentalist imam
3551356 in 2000 mr asbahi briefly served on the board of allied assets advisors fund a delaware registered trust its other board members at the time included jamal said the imam at a fundamentalist controlled mosque in illinois
3551357 other web sites some pro republican and others critical of fundamentalist islam also have reported on the background of mr asbahi he is a frequent speaker before several groups in the u s that scholars have associated with the muslim brotherhood
3551358 the justice department named mr said an unindicted co conspirator in the racketeering trial last year of several alleged hamas fund raisers which ended in a mistrial he has also been identified as a leading member of the group in news reports going back to 1993
3551359 we think some of them are terrorists and since we dont know who well just blame them all
3551360 you know theyre going to come after you now right
3551361 muslim liaison for presidential campaign resigns after connections to muslim community are found
3551362 well they may be a coward but at least obamas a democrat
3551363 this continues to show that despite all statements to the contrary the job of political parties is to win elections not to change the world for the better
3551364 for everyone who said this was a smart move or a necessary one didnt we support obama to create different types of moves than this one didnt we vote for him for a different brand of politics
3551365 as ahmed rehab put it in todays chicago tribune the headline should read
3551366 i suppose rany should console himself with the warm fuzzy thought that the crapping will serve the greater good in the most important election evah
3551367 blame rove and fox for making that what he had to do
3551368 i prefer a winner someone who realizes that sometimes idealism is bad and you have to do things you dont like to do because its the best thing to do for the greater good
3551369 so after he sells out and gets elected then hell do wonders for the
3551370 there are only two options fight back when you must and head off stuff like this before it blows up or play the idealist and do everything you would do in a perfect world and lose thats it you keep wanting to think theres a third option but you havent been around politics at all if you really believe that
3551371 the other side can do anything it wants and gets to define our choices which are
3551372 perhaps we might consider aggressively advocating our views and defending our friends rather than running every time theyre falsely challenged
3551373 ordinary human voters respect people who stand up for what they believe in and are unapologetic about it
3551374 i want something much simpler a fighter who defends his beliefs and his friends instead of deserting them when its hard and i dont think thats too much to ask for
3551375 i can only take heart that this isnt the last and only word in the fight against this kind of stuff
3551376 i take him at his word that hes not a triangulating phony because thats all we can do but nothing good can ever come unless he wins
3551377 mazen asbahi is being appointed to the position we know his background and that he is involved in such and such a mosque where such and such a person was an unindicted co conspirator in such and such a case even though he has these tenuous associations he is the best man for the job because a b and c despite his limited prior associations he left that position when he found out x and within days of finding out there is no sign he has ever done anything wrong or even questionable
3551378 si tu remues de la vielle marde lodeur sort nouveau

3551400 your music helped me through a difficult period of my life
3551401 really guys i know music and you guys are fucking great
3551402 what makes these guys so cool is their ability to include everyone in this thing they have
3551403 you see you see i told you these guys rocked
3551404 got a drunk for mother got a saint for a brother
3551405 my pleasure that was the best band ive seen on that stage in three days
3551406 i took a train down from seattle to see you guys
3551407 that doesnt mean they dont like the music they just dont dance
3551408 that was the most rock and roll thing i ever saw here
3551409 you ride her until she bucks you or you dont ride her at all
3551410 georgian peacekeepers opened fire on the russian peacekeepers with whom they are supposed to work together to carry out their mission of maintaining peace in this region
3551411 you will be a part of our country and well keep bombing you till your grateful for that fact
3551412 russians are the bad guys so the georgians must be the good guys plus theyre pro western
3551413 oh no russias poor defenseless neighbors are being oppressed again
3551414 what are the implications of this conflict for the broader region i e turkey armenia possibly iran
3551415 russias president earlier promised to defend his citizens in south ossetia moscows defence ministry said more than 10 of its peacekeeping troops in south ossetia had been killed and 30 wounded in the georgian offensive at least 15 civilians are also reported dead
3551416 georgia accuses russia of arming the separatists moscow denies the claim
3551417 it wont happen obviously but the ioc should condemn the russian attack and send its delegation of athletes home using a global festival of sport as a cover for a nationalistic land grab and the murder of civilians is disgusting
3551418 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovreign georgian territory
3551419 while i know the olympics and particularly the ioc falls far short of its ideals sport and politics should be separate
3551420 yulia latynina is known for her sharp and polemic statements
3551421 what we have here is a full scale russian invasion of georgian territory
3551422 you can argue that the president of south ossetia who wants independence from georgia is deliberately provoking tbilisi and is trying to suck russia in
3551423 forgive seven times seven and then again turn the other cheek
3551424 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
3551425 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
3551426 i think what is at stake here is the post cold war order
3551427 this is not about democracy vs dictature brave freedom lovers vs evil oppressors but a nasty brawl by power hungry figures on both sides with large slices of corruption the fact that this is turned into a cold war like conflict between good and evil is a domestic political play by some in washington to reinforce their power and push certain policies that have little to do with russia or georgia
3551428 youre saying something that contradicts or complicates my view of the situation therefore you must have a personal stake and in fact are probably a member of group x
3551429 georgias been oppressing its minorities ever since theyve had the chance
3551430 this is not about democracy vs dictature brave freedom lovers vs evil oppressors but a nasty brawl by power hungry figures on both sides with large slices of corruption
3551431 so just stay fat and dumb and shut up and smile
3551432 it is crudely simplistic to cast russia as the sole villain in the clashes over south ossetia the west would be wise to stay out
3551433 no less than the soviet invasion of afghanistan in 1978 the events of the past several days are a bell ringer for defense stocks
3551434 we strongly urge purchase of aerospace defense issues a sector which has declined with the broad market since the start of the year
3551435 this conflict is likely to be brief and fit into a general pattern of tensions within the former borders of the soviet union
3551436 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia
3551437 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3551438 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia
3551439 backed the georgians in rejecting a phrase in the three sentence draft statement that would have required both sides to renounce the use of force council diplomats said
3551440 im out now and in armenia things are pretty crazy and the situation in georgia is terrifying but i felt safe the whole time now we sit and wait to see what happens
3551441 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
3551442 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
3551443 im so glad you eventually reinforced my narrow view of china as a dirty country filled with poor people
3551444 shanghai isnt the real china you need to go to x little town to see real chinese
3551445 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
3551446 we chinese chose our way to forge forward please respect that first and die
3551447 below are some highlights of the nearly 4 hour performance
3551448 get a life look around you and what are you doing to make it better
3551449 i really surprised to see the ceremony how u chinese people spent us 1 400 billion in only 1 day as the world is in worst food crises
3551450 a great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men
3551451 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
3551452 posted by a chinese august 9 08 01 14 am
3551453 a great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men
3551454 how can we see something true when the chinese government does not support a free and open press to show us the true things
3551455 sure china will come up with a sparkling show that will divert everyone from the problems they are having
3551456 you guys develop too fast and you are using our resources
3551457 its a shame the chinese government is supporting the genocide in dar fur
3551458 how do you say in chinese b o r i n g
3551459 its amazing that these same people slaughtered 51 million of their own in the 1950s and rule over their own people now with a sledge hammer free tibet
3551460 there has been no progress towards fulfilling these promises only continued deterioration
3551461 the authorities have used the olympic games as pretext to continue and in some respects intensify existing policies and practices which have led to serious and widespread violations of human rights
3551462 china really needs to be releasing human rights activists in order to be showing its following through with its promises
3551463 sending a message that it is acceptable for a government to host the olympic games in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution
3551464 china is the last country on earth barring myanmar that deserved to be selected to host the olympics shame the ioc didnt wait until the chinese authorities learned to behave in a civilized fashion towards all of their people spectacular display however albeit the soulless regimentation comes over as a bit creepy i wonder how many walmart sweatshop workers got to see it
3551465 you have the right to keep yourself away from any made in china goods and i strongly encourage you to do so if you cant do that just shut your mouth up
3551466 you can do anything you set your mind to when you have vision determination and an endless supply of expendable labor
3551467 wow not a single latino white or black face in the ceremony is diversity a strength as so many pandering politicians parrot as often as possible or is it a neutral ask the chinese would the opening ceremony in beijing have been better if every single performer didnt look just like every other
3551468 even if the last picture is showing a typical family in china what i can see is the spirit in the childrens eyes their joy and pride after watching such an impressive ceremony hosted by their own country
3551469 hey kids cant you read this one is for colored thats for white only thats the one you should use
3551470 boykott og in nations like china its a dictatorship no real human rights
3551471 its a pleasure to welcome friends from far away we chinese ppl welcome all friends from all over the world to come visit china
3551472 let us love one another for love is god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love
3551473 there are friends come from faf place how pleasan it is
3551474 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
3551475 the ability to think say and do what we want
3551476 if you have never been to china please shut up your mouth although its true that our goverment still has a long way to go but people most entitled to critisize it are we chinese we suppot our government and we will monitor it as well as help it do better in future chinese people now is living better and better thats doubtless truth we scorn to quarrel whis those arrogant and ignorant people before commenting others i think youd better care about your own country first of all
3551477 100 years ago china was invaded by civilized countries because china is barbaric
3551478 you guys develop too fast and you are using our resources
3551479 when you point a finger at others your three other fingers are pointing right back at you
3551480 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
3551481 to vet their name and information against our existing database for out of service orders
3551482 nowhere in extent at least spread such stretches of heath and moor golden in the spring with the blaze of furze and in the autumn purple with heather and bronzed with the fading fern nowhere in england rise such oak woods their boughs rimed with the frostwork of lichens and dark beech groves with their floor of red brown leaves on which the branches weave their own warp and woof of light and shade

3551513 its a sad thing in this business that diligent dedicated disciplined journeyman chefs can work away really hard putting in incredible hours to build a business and then when its at the top the owners bring in a star name to give it an extra boost when they cant take it any further its a classic situation in the restaurant business and thats probably exactly what happened here josh was great and did a fantastic job but now they wanted some extra glitz and glamor with a tv name attached to it
3551514 i have the pleasure and satisfaction of knowing our incredible kitchen staff was the best in the business and some nights turned out an amazing 1 200 top notch gourmet dinners at the same time as hosting another 1 000 simultaneously for cocktails there arent many restaurants that could claim that anywhere in the world so i depart on the best of terms knowing we achieved everything and more that we set out to do
3551515 i have never made but one prayer to god a very short one o lord make my enemies ridiculous and god granted it

3551517 what we want to do is bring our schools up to standard as far as facilities
3551518 this campus the original buildings are 45 years old so were renovating the restrooms were bringing in more energy efficient lighting heating and air and even the windows and were going to do some rewiring to bring it up to 21st century standards
3551519 were going to have lab tables for the kids much more interactive with computers at the labs so were expecting an upgrade rather than the traditional old fashioned lab
3551520 it will be a definite change for students who come back and are used to going down certain sidewalks in certain buildings where for the next two years theyll be taking alternate paths to their facilities
3551521 its almost like getting a new school within the existing walls of the campus

3551530 the main idea behind nobhill was to create a restaurant that would reflect the type of dining opportunities found throughout san francisco in one comfortable neighborhood style location
3551531 the menu features a diverse selection of the type of food and fresh products most closely associated with dining in san francisco at least 80 percent of the product comes from growers and producers located in the bay area it is the first time some of the items have been available outside of northern california
3551532 it is to be a humble space this isnt a fusion of anything there is no show there is no las vegas in the room nothing shouting design
3551533 and the food reminds us all why san francisco is such a great food town
3551534 if it catches fire it will melt but the great thing is you can just throw it in the sink to put out the flames
3551535 our fish imports are truly unique with 35 different species

3551551 una idea real de lo que sucede a pie de calle
3551552 los periodistas profesionales no pueden hacer reportajes reales desde los hoteles de 5 estrellas en que se alojan
3551553 el periodismo profesional es artificial y moribundo no hay medios libres en el golfo

3551563 my read was that the westerners felt shame in those situations but they were inhibiting those responses and i think that is supported by the blind findings
3551564 in american and other western cultures were taught from a very early age not to show shame its stigmatized whereas in the east its appropriate to show shame in a major olympic failure for instance
3551565 with pride the original function may have been actually if i make myself larger that tells others im someone to watch out for
3551566 over the course of evolution humans would acquire the innate propensity to associate this display with success
3551567 there are many times where its not that adaptive to show shame essentially youre saying i just screwed up
3551568 but if you really feel yourself weaker than an adversary and you could convey that that you agree youre more powerful than me i submit to you dont hurt me and we both save resources compared to if we had to fight my guess is thats why its still around
3551569 here are people who have never seen people express this
3551570 the only possible explanation you could make is well maybe their parents physically move their bodies in this way to teach them
3551571 given the specificity of the response were not just talking about a simple arm stretch but chest expansion and shoulders pulling back and everything to me that seems like a less parsimonious suggestion than it being innate
3551572 primatologists have found that chimps show an inflated display when the alpha chimp is about to fight he puffs his shoulders and walks in a cocky gate
3551573 submission displays have been documented that involve cowering lowering of the body
3551574 thats pretty similar to hunching the shoulders and the shame display but theres a difference between these anecdotal observations and an empirical study no ones coded a bunch of chimps and seen what are the exact behaviors you see in these situations
3551575 the leaders deliberated on the issue but could not arrive at a workable formula or solution that would please the people
3551576 unfortunately we were sent to the boxing ring with our hands tied behind us
3551577 and in a place like darfur where there are no roads you need flexibility and helicopters are really another value added to the operation
3551578 if we dont we may be short of it a little bit but we are working day and night both at the mission and with the headquarters and with friends of unamid to make sure we hit that 80 percent by december this year
3551579 we are not outside the milf we are milf and are not a lost command
3551580 but if we were hit first thats another matter thats already a standing order and it means fighting
3551581 i often talk to eid kabalu he knows our disposition and we follow the standing order
3551582 they should do the final signing one word is enough for a wise man wheres justice it is they who did not keep their word
3551583 theres no need for a clearance from our chair in the milf if we are the ones being pummeled its fighting at once
3551584 of course we have to fight because that was the standing order
3551585 i have no child who was killed in the fighting the only child i lost was when it was still in the womb of my wife
3551586 on the issue of what to do with kato for committing acts of violence the philippine national police pnp was preparing for the filing of specific charges for the illegal acts he committed
3551587 we are in the process of strengthening our evidence so we could file charges against kato on the criminal acts he has committed during the past few days we will file charges and we are hoping that warrant of arrest would be issued
3551588 without thaksin people can talk i think theres a feeling that we should have a new beginning
3551589 you can see that within the political class there are some true believers in thaksin but theres an awful lot of others who went with him because he was the man of the moment
3551590 if samak can hold the party together and strike the right compromises with thaksins antagonists maybe his government will last but most people are betting it wont
3551591 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
3551592 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3551593 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3551594 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3551595 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3551596 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3551597 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3551598 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3551599 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3551600 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3551601 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3551602 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3551603 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3551604 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3551605 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are
3551606 as much as we have given the eastern people their right to own land we will soon ensure that northern people would be free to do likewise
3551607 it is vital the cica understands that women are not responsible for mens criminality because they have a drink or for any other reason
3551608 nobody would suggest that if someones wallet was stolen after having a drink then their compensation should be reduced
3551609 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable due to alcohol consumption
3551610 as i understand it the cica have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases that they believe may also have had the guidelines misinterpreted and review them without the victims themselves having to go back and ask for that review
3551611 if an applicant accepts our decision then that case is finalised and closed
3551612 if they wish to ask for a review they must do this themselves in writing
3551613 contributed to the circumstances which gave rise to the injury
3551614 old prejudices like if a woman is wearing a short skirt or acting in a certain way are still operational
3551615 by reducing compensation because a woman has been drinking the cica is operating under those old prejudices
3551616 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3551617 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption this supports our view that a victim of rape is not in anyway culpable due to alcohol consumption
3551618 a victim of rape should not have any compensation reduced because of their drinking i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases
3551619 this continues to show the insurgents are desperate to destabilize afghanistan with no regard for the lives of innocent afghans
3551620 we expect the storm will exacerbate food price inflation which hit 45 percent in july and drove headline inflation to 27 percent
3551621 unlike the rest of the region where we forecast cpi inflation peaking in the current quarter we expect vietnams inflation to continue to accelerate
3551622 you must first connect to itunes with an internet connection to enable youtube
3551623 we really wanted this functionality for yahoo services but we thought that if we just do it ourselves it is much less likely to get wide adoption
3551624 were still pretty early stages in this location stuff but if we can get wide adoption of fire eagle across the web we can become a leader
3551625 but the knicks id rather switch places with michael vick
3551626 he doesnt care about loyalty and the knicks dont care about winning
3551627 i recently received a page from the washington post june 19 2008 page a9
3551628 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3551629 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3551630 the cabin is one of 200 artifacts that were offered to us through the fbi the unabomber is an interesting case of the combative sometimes cooperative relationship of the press with the fbi
3551631 the cabin had a definite media hook since the artifact was provided by the fbi and we think it is a dramatic way of retelling the story to visitors we intend to keep it as part of the exhibit
3551632 well make sure that qantas responds appropriately that all the maintenance documentation relating to these aircraft has been checked and double checked
3551633 all passengers have been advised about the disruptions but it would be premature to say anything more that this stage
3551634 qantas discovered an irregularity with paperwork for these aircraft during an internal integrity check of maintenance records
3551635 in line with our prudent response to any maintenance issue however minor we have elected to suspend the operation of the six aircraft while we ensure all our records are 100 per cent accurate and we have advised the civil aviation safety authority
3551636 have those whose ideas integrity and independent self reliance create and inspire excellence abdicated their place leaving the rest to survive on their meager wits

3551656 what they were able to do is take out a small conventional force like georgia
3551657 the russian military pretty much went into free fall in the early 1990s
3551658 the russian incursion into georgian territory and the air campaign against georgian military targets show a confident russian military
3551659 clearly the russian military is still capable of launching complex combined arms operations
3551660 if were talking about a theaterwide war in europe it would be a very different picture
3551661 a military confrontation with russia would be unlike a confrontation with any other country because they still have a superpower sized nuclear arsenal
3551662 what i was hoping for with him and what i got is that he didnt use anything as an excuse
3551663 he put it all upon himself he didnt use the way the coach used him or injuries or being young when he came in the league none of that
3551664 he took responsibility for himself and really once he did that for me it was easy thats one of the biggest things to get athletes to hold themselves accountable whether he did that when he was 18 or 19 im pretty sure i was mature at 18 or 19 but i wouldnt have been ready to be thrown into a no 1 pick or right into the nba and handle that kind of responsibility whether he acknowledged responsibility at that time didnt really matter to me the fact that now he does is the only thing i want to judge him on
3551665 walter is a player with tremendous work ethic and showed last year that he is a player that can contribute to this team

3551676 well i think it will just scare people if they know everybodys pulling together i think it will slow them down
3551677 we have burglaries we have juveniles disrespecting elderly folks you name it its a combination of things out here
3551678 oh yeah theres been more patrols ive actually seen law enforcement out here at night and in the day time
3551679 about half of the profession now believes that psychology has a useful role to play in economic modeling and that number is growing
3551680 for too long the united states has been trapped in a debate between the laissez faire types who believe markets will solve all our problems and the command and control types who believe that if there is a market failure then you need a mandate
3551681 the laissez faire types are right that government can blunder so opt outs are important
3551682 the mandate types are right that people are fallible and they make mistakes and sometimes people who are specialists know better and can steer people in directions that will make their lives better
3551683 nudges are inevitable so they might as well be smart
3551684 the first paper i wrote on behavioral economics was rejected by five journals
3551685 part of the problem was that i didnt have any role models so i wasnt sure what to do
3551686 when i read this paper i could hardly contain myself
3551687 this concept is what was necessary to make the psychology of decision making relevant for economics
3551688 for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science especially concerning human judgment and decision making under uncertainty
3551689 which is another way of saying that thaler has won
3551690 while i wouldnt call him a shoo in i would say he is favored to win the prize someday
3551691 he is just an unusually nice guy and that is not necessarily the norm among successful academics
3551692 the pre eminent legal scholar of our time the most wide ranging the most prolific the most influential
3551693 its funny when he gets under stress when something goes wrong in his life he writes there were some stressful periods during the writing of the book when he sent me like five chapters in rapid succession
3551694 ive never even written a book out of whole cloth
3551695 the next day i called cass and said i met this obama guy
3551696 cass is closer to the obama camp than i am he and barack are very good friends
3551697 if incentives and nudges replace requirements and bans government will be both smaller and more modest
3551698 we are not for bigger government just for better governance
3551699 it made me think that these ideas really could bridge the political divide

3551710 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read
3551711 fuller never met him bryant but re creating him has dragged her into a world of greed and power and destruction and beauty more instructive on the unsettled state of the democratic party and its current leftward drift we are witnessing a tectonic shift from the centrism that president clinton embraced and imposed on his restive followers to a more open throated liberalism now referred to as progressivism that is angry and spoiling for a fight
3551712 similar but similar enough that they could probably slip this into a cable re airing of

3551751 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people
3551752 mr tsvangirai won the first round of the presidential election his party the mdc won a parliamentary majority
3551753 whatever happened between the two parties weve no knowledge of it

3551784 net broadband additions in the quarter were the fewest of any quarter in the seven years lrg has been tracking the industry
3551785 while the relative number of quarterly broadband adds has certainly peaked the decline in additions this quarter compared to the same period last year was exacerbated by verizon and at amp ts emphasis on selling higher speed fios and u verse bundled services often at the expense of the traditional dsl service
3551786 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace
3551787 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl cable modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country

3551798 while the availability of finance has tightened up recently over the longer term we do not expect that a shortage of housing finance will be one of the problems that australia will have to confront reserve bank of australia assistant governor philip lowe told a financial services forum in sydney today

3551801 the big lift in aggregate house prices in australia took place between 1996 and 2003 prior to that in a number of other countries the assistant governor said
3551802 it meant that just at the time that financial innovation was accelerating around the world and investors were looking for new higher yielding assets australian households were digesting the big run up in debt and house prices that had occurred earlier in the decade mr lowe said
3551803 are undoubtedly currently strained the aggregate position of the household sector is in better shape than it would have been had the housing boom run on longer and coincided with these developments in the global system
3551804 lean against a financial boom particularly if significant debt financed imbalances are building up in the system

3551807 but this scene the one with don draper redacted an odious she manager into submission sent a message you think this is escapism lifestyle fun entourage with better suits wrong o
3551808 betty is unexpectedly happy like her husband shes just paid her freight by sucking up to the people who pay for her lifestyle and like don she just did so by managing expectations the episode ends with something we rarely get from mad men a scene in which don and betty feel like both a real couple and a real team
3551809 as betty sits in that car at episodes end reflecting on another night of her husband using her as window dressing for a deal or in this case worse bait for the leering of a famous drunk she cant hide from it anymore she plays to don like shes happy to be part of his life but shes crying because she realizes that yes she is profoundly sad and has no idea how to go about improving this state of things

3551819 he was mad because he didnt get what he wanted he was going to make his stand
3551820 and the bear just came and pounced on him for no apparent reason
3551821 i dont know if you would call a bear like that a demented bear like some people or a super bear that decides hey i can take a person
3551822 when we listen to men planning and arguing and thinking aloud we get the impression of a vast number of things in this world which are known to be desirable but dismissed as impossible men spend the greater part of their lives putting limitations on the power of god faith is the ability to lay hold on that grace which is sufficient for all things in such a way that the things which are humanly impossible become divinely possible with god all things are possible and therefore the word impossible has no place in the vocabulary of the christian and of the christian church
3551823 it is extremely fortunate that neither workers nor bystanders were killed or injured today
3551824 following our investigations we will consider where responsibility lies with regard to workplace safety laws
3551825 it is impermissible and foreign to the spirit of marxism leninism to elevate one person to transform him into a superman possessing supernatural characteristics akin to those of a god such a belief about a man and specifically about stalin was cultivated among us for many years
3551826 it was determined that of the 139 members and candidates of the partys central committee who were elected at the seventeenth congress 98 persons that is 70 percent were arrested and shot mostly in 1937 38
3551827 eikhe was forced under torture to sign ahead of time a protocol of his confession prepared by the investigative judges in which he and several other eminent party workers were accused of anti soviet activity on october 1 1939 eikhe sent his declaration to stain in which he categorically denied his guilt and asked for an examination of his case in the declaration he wrote there is no more bitter misery than to sit in the jail of a government for which i have always fought on february 4 eikhe was shot
3551828 all the more monstruous are the acts whose initiator was stalin and which are rude violations of the basic leninist principles of the nationality policy of the soviet state we refer to the mass deportations from their native places of whole nations together with all communists and komsomols without any exception this deportation action was not dictated by any military considerations the ukrainians avoided meeting this fate only because there were too many of them and there was no place to which to deport them otherwise he would have deported them also
3551829 stalin personally called the investigative judge gave him instructions advised him on which investigative methods should be used these methods were simple beat beat and once again beat

3551831 the quaint colonial town of amherst n h into a saudi arabian bedouin tent community
3551832 the traditions of saudi arabia at this time prevent women from participating in these public roles
3551833 the united states government gives money and a federal seal of approval to a university middle east studies center that center offers a government approved k 12 middle east studies curriculum to americas teachers but in fact that curriculum has been bought and paid for by the saudis who may even have trained the personnel who operate the universitys outreach program meanwhile the american government is asleep at the wheel paying scant attention to how its federally mandated public outreach programs actually work so without ever realizing it americas taxpayers end up subsidizing and providing official federal approval for k 12 educational materials on the middle east that have been created under saudi auspices game set match saudis
3551834 cited numerous documented contacts that officers had with ramos and his companion lopez and said both were active members of the ms 13 street gang
3551835 we cannot in good conscience ignore such suffering and injustice
3551836 as much as we would all like to see the country move in a completely different direction and fast maybe just stopping our current course will have to do for now
3551837 sodium just curious which post from max to me re his 100 gold political position on obama and aipac i mean hes voiced that particular position 5 jillion
3551838 holy crap did you hear what the man said to aipac
3551839 interesting i still feel the differences between the two parties is minimal and the elite and special interests call the shots for our republic is a plutocracy realizing this helps me understand why we see what we see hope i am wrong
3551840 my objective is always to make as much political progress as possible under the actual circumstances we got obama nominated because we see him as the most progressive real alternative and now we must take advantage of our victory by pressing our progressive agenda let us defend him against attacks from the right while at the same time pulling to the left obama is very strong now and healthy strong constructive criticism from the left will not hurt his chances
3551841 but hell all those zionists were glad to be told what they wanted to hear at the time but they knew even then it had to be a huge pander and they all said
3551842 a passionate attachment to foreign interests even more intense than those that worried president george washington is now distorting our nations authority and preventing it from effective action only by heeding george washingtons sage advice will america be able to prevent further episode in a seemingly endless war between israel and the arabs that might culminate in irrevocable catastraphe for both arabs andisraelis
3551843 specifically at some point obama needs to refine his message on the israeli palestinian conflict and attempt to undo what damage his aipac message may have done i agree with that but i also dont know how fair it is to demand a solution to such an enormous problem that he had no parts in the creation of
3551844 the whole presentation was so relentlessly optimistic several reporters wondered aloud what plouffe saw as the major dangers for the campaign going forward in response to a question about dissatisfaction on the left regarding some of obamas recent positions such as the recent fisa compromise plouffe said he had not really been aware of any major discord on that front
3551845 its the reason why many of us keep saying to ourselves or nobody in particular
3551846 sounds like nader is trying to attract the kkk vote
3551847 the argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies one perhaps of the right and the other of the left is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers
3551848 when these ducks keep walking and talking and looking like ducks for the last several decades then we would all do ourselves quality service by not fighting them anymore and simply accept that they are in fact ducks evolved ducks but still ducks not ducks we can like or nuzzle up to or even make good tasting duck soup with but ducks just the same
3551849 vice presidential search groups searching does obama mccain have a plan for the folks at the beginning not bottom of the economic ladder how are either of these men going to pay for what they promise
3551850 the illusion of freedom in america will continue as long as its profitable to continue the illusion at the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain they will just take down the scenery they will pull back the curtains they will move the tables and chairs out of the way and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theater
3551851 seems the liberals cant get it together to attack people capable of rebuttal
3551852 i normally dont say unkind things about the recently deceased

3551855 if youre going to tell someone to go to hell make sure you can make him go
3551856 its one of those things you cant control in terms of the rain but what we are doing is as much as humanly possible to prevent any overflow
3551857 we have got this other pond in the paddock here which can contain several days of overflow
3551858 we are just reviewing our options its just another step in the process for us
3551859 we would rather do things well than do them half heartedly
3551860 what we were trying to do is have an upmarket cul de sac which farmers in the area could retire to it would give them a feeling of space and still be in the feilding area
3551861 after renewing the oil agreement between the two countries during iraqi prime minister nuri june visit to jordan iraq has agreed to increase the oil discount from 18 dollars a barrel to 22 dollars a barrel
3551862 technical teams and engineers from the state company for iraqi ports have finished all rehabilitation work in the port which was opened today following a four month stoppage
3551863 iraq and china are concerned with completing the agreement to develop ahdab oil field
3551864 although the declines in notices of defaults seem promising much of this can be explained by the actions of just one lender
3551865 ninety one percent of the decline in notices of default since april can be attributed to countrywide financial unfortunately this is more likely due to the challenges of integrating two companies the size of countrywide financial and bank of america than it is a fundamental shift in foreclosure activity
3551866 the addition of therapy staff is an important step in the realization of our strategic growth plan and we are extremely pleased to have made our second acquisition in the allied health sector working together with mr diamond and mr glomski we believe that orion
3551867 we are excited about our partnership with orion because of their culture of commitment to their employees
3551868 this acquisition is a meaningful step forward in executing our strategy of building a leading national player in the value added healthcare staffing space the combination of the therapy staff business model the talent of their existing management team and orion

3551900 melinda was a lovely person and she wasnt a drug dealer or anything like that she was a good person she did her own thing
3551901 i had a weird dream last night about what happened if i did get shot
3551902 i was yelling you better come back here you better pay for that or ill call the cops
3551903 i ran after him theres a parking lot behind the store he pulled a gun on me and he asked for my effin money so i dropped my wallet and just ran away because i was scared if he was going to shoot me or what
3551904 i thought that he was being brave but i was really scared because he was missing for 20 minutes
3551905 the first thing is to call 911 definitely dont start running behind anybody we dont know them just like what he encountered it could be risky
3551906 now that this issue has been resolved i look forward to moving this case forward
3551907 im sorry that the defense has filed motions which only serve to delay the case in fact there has not been a rush to justice in this case the fontana family has endured lengthy delays and been denied their day in court
3551908 while we respect the courts decision we continue to believe that lane liroff and his office has a conflict of interest such they cannot be fair and even handed in their treatment of deshawn campbell because they continue to unconstituionally seek the death penalty against a man who is mentally retarded
3551909 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3551910 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3551911 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3551912 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3551913 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3551914 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3551915 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3551916 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3551917 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3551918 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3551919 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3551920 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3551921 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3551994 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3551995 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3551996 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3551997 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3552002 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3552003 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3552004 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3552005 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3552006 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3552007 could europe be involved in a peacekeeping mission europe is available to do that of course
3552008 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3552009 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them

3552014 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3552015 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3552016 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3552017 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3552018 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis

3552024 llevaba viniendo tres temporadas y este a o ha elegido otra opci n pero afortunadamente el huesca ha querido venir aqu y estamos muy satisfechos por ello es un equipo que levanta expectaci n seguro que habr muchos aficionados que querr verlo in situ y el partido del viernes va a ser una oportunidad para disfrutar y tenerlo cerca
3552025 seguro que este encuentro es m s disputado es dif cil tener en bolta a un partido de este nivel donde un segunda divisi n se enfrenta a un segunda b y por eso pensamos que el pueblo de bolta a y los alrededores se van a volcar as como los aficionados de ambos equipos que se sumar n al evento
3552026 desde luego sostiene el alcalde que en bolta a tienen nuestro apoyo ya que han sabido ser agradecidos con el entorno planificando su preparaci n sin salir de arag n y llev ndola casi toda a cabo en la provincia de huesca les estamos agradecidos porque esto sirve tambi n para promocionar nuestras instalaciones que ya son muy valoradas fuera de nuestras fronteras aunque hay veces que parece que dentro no se sepan apreciar
3552027 aunque intentaremos hacer gestiones en todas las direcciones para que esto no sea un problema
3552028 pero a d a de hoy no me atrever a a decir que los porteros del promesas javi jim nez o kevin tendr n posibilidades de ser convocados ante sporting y villarreal
3552029 nuestra arma ser n las jugadas a bal n parado
3552030 las sensaciones son bastante buenas el comportamiento del equipo en los partidos disputados hasta ahora ha sido positivo aunque todav a queda la ltima fase de la preparaci n que es la m s importante para nosotros de cara inicio del campeonato
3552031 nos han metido pocos goles y eso es muy importante para sumar puntos todos estamos trabajando mucho sin pelota por lo que ganamos enteros cuando defendemos no es una labor s la de la l nea de retaguardia sino de todos los jugadores si seguimos as podremos hacer cosas importantes
3552032 el m ster est compaginando a todos los futbolistas y poniendo casi siempre a dos equipos diferentes aunque en los ltimos amistosos algunos est n jugando un poco m s en los pr ximos seguro que se empezar a ver cosas m s serias ya que nos servir n un poco de referencia de cara al inicio del campeonato
3552033 el grupo que acab la liga el a o pasado las incorporaciones se han acoplado muy r pido y pueden ofrecernos muchas cosas positivas se marcharon jugadores importantes caso de trashorras adri n o christian sin embargo se ha sabido compensar bien esas bajas
3552034 somos un equipo competitivo pero habr que demostrarlo cada jornada hay mucha ilusi n por realizar una gran campa a

3552043 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3552044 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3552045 as your ie is rendering those html instructions there could be malicious code embedded in those pages that will allow code to be downloaded and executed on that web page without the users knowledge or intervention
3552046 i think this is really like a perfect storm for microsoft office because each and every component is affected
3552047 since there is broad reliance on ipsec to establish secure encrypted communications for companies sharing critical information among remote offices this one is especially important to look at
3552048 this could allow attackers to steal windows messenger user ids and then invite other people to audio and video conferences pretending to be the victim
3552049 this is sort of a different vulnerability that we have not seen too many times before it could also allow the attackers to look at the chat sessions of victims
3552050 usually all it takes is one person finding out then they give the exploit code to everyone else

3552057 barangsiapa mengerjakan perbuatan yang tidak kami perintahkan dalam agama maka ia tertolak
3552058 artinya hai orang orang beriman taatilah allah dan taatilah rasul nya dan ulil amri pemimpin pemimpin di antara kamu maka jika kamu berselisih pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah kepada allah dan rasul sunnah jika kamu benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian yang demikian itu lebih utama bagimu dan lebih baik akibatnya

3552061 para tabiin dari ahli syam syiria sekarang seperti khalid bin madaan makhul luqman dan lainnya pernah mengagung agungkan dan berijtihad melakukan ibadah pada malam nisfu syaban kemudian orang orang berikutnya mengambil keutamaan dan pengagungan itu dari mereka
3552062 menjalankan ibadah di masjid pada malam itu secara jamaah tidak bidah
3552063 barangsiapa mengerjakan suatu amalan dalam agama yang tidak kami perintahkan maka ia tertolak
3552064 diriwayatkan oelh wadhdhah dari zaid bin aslam berkata kami belum pernah melihat seorang pun dari sesepuh dan ahli fiqih kami yang menghadiri perayaan malam nisfu syaban tidak mengindahkan hadits makhul dhaif dan tidak pula memandang adanya keutamaan pada malam tersebut terhadap malam malam lainnya

3552068 janganlah kamu sekalian mengkhususkan malam jumat daripada malam malam lainnya dengan suatu shalat dan janganlah kamu sekalian mengkhususkan siang hariny autk berpuasa daripada hari hari lainnya kecuali jika sebelumnya hari itu telah berpuasa seseorang di antara kamu
3552069 artinya barangsiapa berdiri melakukan shalat pada bulan ramadhan dengan penuh rasa iman dan harapan pahala niscaya allah akan mengampuni dosanya yang telah lewat dan barangsiapa berdiri melakukan shalat pada malam lailatul qadar dengan penuh rasa iman dan harapan pahala niscaya allah akan mengampuni dosanya yang telah lewat

3552076 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation the entire islanders organization looks forward to working with scott
3552077 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3552078 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future

3552080 what is showing through is that were up in pretty much all areas for taranaki which is good
3552081 im not really surprised after the result of june there is always a bit of movement that happens there seems to be the rise and fall were lucky in taranaki because we are cushioned to some degree particularly with the dairying scene and the energy scene but generally its pretty good reading its nothing like sales of a couple of years ago but this is a good sign
3552082 there is an unmistakable degree of recovery in july which is surprising given that it is generally regarded as the worst winter month with good improvement in median prices around the country despite continued low sales volumes
3552083 the fact is that for the market nationally to achieve an unchanged median price against the pressure of the declining auckland market is a remarkably good result in the circumstances and it is beginning to look like the june figures may have given a poor reading of the markets health
3552084 if this is as bad as it gets then perhaps the market is in better shape than we thought

3552101 didalam hati manusia ada rasa cinta terhadap sesuatu yang ia sembah dan ia ibadahi ini merupakan tonggak untuk tegak dan kokohnya hati seseorang serta baiknya jiwa mereka
3552102 sesungguh nya orang yang mencintai sesuatu akan mendapatkan lezatnya cinta manakala yang ia cintai itu bisa membuat lupa dari musibah yang menimpanya
3552103 bahwa ia merupakan sebab yang paling kuat untuk bisa bersabar sehingga tidak menyelisihi dan bermaksiat kepada nya
3552104 maka seorang yang tulus dalam cintanya ia akan merasa diawasi oleh yang dicintainya yang selalu menyertai hati dan raganya dan diantara tanda cinta yang tulus ialah ia merasa terus menerus kehadiran kekasihnya yang mengawasi perbuatannya thariqul hijratain hal 449 450
3552105 antara cinta dan perasaan was was terdapat perbe daan dan pertentangan yang besar sebagaimana perbedaan antara ingat dan lalai maka cinta yang menghujam di hati akan menghilangkan keragu raguan terhadap yang dicintainya
3552106 adapun mencintai rabb subhannahu wa taala maka keadaannya tidaklah sama dengan keadaan mencin tai selain nya karena tidak ada yang paling dicintai hati selain pencipta dan pengaturnya dialah sesembahannya yang diibadahi walinya rabb nya pengaturnya pemberi rizkinya yang mematikan dan menghidupkannya
3552107 maka alloh akan mendatangkan satu kaum yang alloh mencintai mereka dan merekapun mencintai alloh

3552133 theres all sorts of things that can potentially cause it
3552134 drowning is certainly one but i think thats certainly less likely just straight forward drowning
3552135 generally speaking youve got people that are reasonably good swimmers and unless the water conditions are really awful its unlikely so then that opens it up to other things like some sort of arrhythmia which would basically be undetectable on autopsy
3552136 we dont completely understand the mechanisms of pulmonary edema that is associated with swimming
3552137 there must be something else that happens maybe the result of some psychological condition thats associated with the excitement of being in the race
3552138 i think these tight wet suits contribute a little anxiety hyperventilating
3552139 the pressure of the water basically squeezes the chest pressure and causes blood to back up into the lungs thats the best explanation i have heard im just wondering if certain people were prone to it
3552140 now you have people of all athletic abilities youre going to have people out there who have heart disease who are not getting screened for it and they exert themselves and the water is not forgiving if you get out of breath on land you dont drown
3552141 when we have someone die during sports and we dont know why because theres no real autopsy finding on that its an electrical problem very difficult to diagnose youd have to diagnose it beforehand with an electrocardiogram

3552162 the big lift in aggregate house prices in australia took place between 1996 and 2003 prior to that in a number of other countries the assistant governor said
3552163 it meant that just at the time that financial innovation was accelerating around the world and investors were looking for new higher yielding assets australian households were digesting the big run up in debt and house prices that had occurred earlier in the decade mr lowe said
3552164 are undoubtedly currently strained the aggregate position of the household sector is in better shape than it would have been had the housing boom run on longer and coincided with these developments in the global system

3552166 could distort the competitive position of different institutions in the financial system he said
3552167 the trade offs are difficult and the implementation challenges are considerable james bonds island
3552168 i cant say i have ever had a challenge like this before
3552169 its the most inexperienced offensive line that i have ever been associated with but theyre good kids theyre willing to work but at this point we have a long long way to go
3552170 i had one of the very best offensive lines in college football if not the best
3552171 when i left ucla in 1995 our left tackle was jonathan ogden and his backup was kris farris and they both won the outland trophy
3552172 fill up her f ing car please i cant live like this
3552173 scott has been one of the top up and coming coaches in hockey and with good reason
3552174 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation the entire islanders organization looks forward to working with scott
3552175 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3552176 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future
3552177 i have other nude photographs of carla far more explicit but i would never sell them
3552178 they are hunters who met predators its a good thing he has seduced many women and she was a kind of seductress when two like this meet it can be good
3552179 i used to think john edwards was soft but this makes me think he is a regular guy i like him now
3552180 it is time to stop pretending that there is a bright future for sunderland and ask ourselves instead what we need to do to offer people in sunderland better prospects
3552181 this independent report does not reflect conservative party policy and we do not agree with its conclusions we wholeheartedly support the regeneration of northern cities

3552185 its been three years and i need to get back in here
3552186 the tourist areas of town have been open for business for a long time
3552187 but getting people back into hard hit neighborhoods is one of the challenges we still face
3552188 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history is a pretty amazing accomplishment
3552189 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
3552190 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3552191 divorce rates were certainly lower before and up to the mid 60s when pill use became commonplace but as you can imagine there are plenty of alternative explanations for increasing divorce rates since then a definitive study has yet to be done im seeking funding for this
3552192 women were more likely to report having had affairs and reported lower sexual satisfaction with their current partner
3552193 i supposed im pleased he never got that particular job as being in a canoe is a lot safer than hurtling through outer space
3552194 when david picked up the application form one of the questions was do you speak fluent russian david didnt but said yes anyway and immediately set about learning the language for the interview
3552195 it was worth a try but i didnt get the job
3552196 just before i came out here i found out they didnt want me
3552197 id apply again but it doesnt come up too often and this year was the first time non test pilots could try out
3552198 being an astronaut would have been interesting job but racing a canoe is my real passion
3552199 winning an olympic medal is the culmination of 11 hard years of training ive dreamed about this moment id have loved to have been accepted on to the space programme but i wasnt too upset as id always known it was a long shot
3552200 his bagpipe playing is better than his russian in fact its pretty good
3552201 i just told him his first run was great and the gold was within his grasp if he came out and went for it it was pretty close the brit was beaten by slovak racer michal martikan who went last and knew what he had to produce on the course
3552202 it didnt put me off it made me more determined because id enjoyed the race i was hooked
3552203 it was a bit strange how david started because one of my canoes was strapped to the wall on the side of our house for years and he never took a blind bit of notice
3552204 but when he saw his uncle go into the water that was it
3552205 while this helps us understand the root causes it doesnt change the fundamental problem that we are as a nation less active than we should be
3552206 all children regardless of their natural abilities should be given adequate encouragement and support to be physically active at school and at home
3552207 this data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time

3552209 we will be told it is for use in combating terrorism and organised crime but if ripa powers are anything to go by it will soon be used to spy on ordinary peoples kids pets and bins

3552215 in a televised address georgian president mikhail saakashvili has vowed to restore tbilisis control over what he called the
3552216 what we should be talking about is food security not food
3552217 and if they think also that somehow its all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3552218 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out i think it will be an absolute disaster

3552227 if achtemeiers book reaches that large body of christians looking for a nonfundamentalistic doctrine of scripture it could play a major role in creating a framework for them he comes across as possessing a deep love and respect for the bible and for the lord and eager for people to place their minds and lives beneath its authority he offers us in the end of the doctrine of a covenental scripture given by god to his people for their edification and renewal a dynamic document which can perform this service two thousand years after its completion confronting us with gods word for our situation through the power of the spirit i am highly grateful for this book and recommend it highly to others

3552240 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people

3552385 in der ungeraden rede spricht man von dem sinne z b der rede eines anderen
3552386 in der ungeraden rede spricht man von dem sinne z
3552387 it is quite clear that in this way of speaking words do not have their customary referents but designate what is usually their sense
3552388 jenes gescheiht z b wenn man die worte eines andern in gerader rede anf hrt
3552389 this happens for instance when the words of another are quoted
3552390 ein satz bedeutet in der geraden rede wieder einen satz und in der ungeraden einen gedanken
3552391 in direct quotation a sentence designates another sentence and in indirect quotation a thought
3552392 the first case occurs when one quotes someone elses words in direct ordinary discourse
3552393 when words are used in the customary manner then what is talked about are their nominata
3552394 but it may happen that one wishes to speak about the words themselves or about their senses
3552395 es kann aber auch verkommen dass mann von dem worten selbst oder von ihrem sinne reden will
3552396 the latter words have the usual nominata gew hnliche bedeutung in german
3552397 a word icon in quotes must therefore not be taken in the customary manner

3552400 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
3552401 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
3552402 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

3552410 if you go around far enough youll end up to the east of where you started
3552411 insofar as we are thinking about the transition from february 2007 to january 2008
3552412 if you go around far enough youll end up to the east of where you started
3552413 any x to the west of y is also a y to the east of x
3552414 to take a step east is to be west of where you started
3552415 any x to the west of y is also a y to the east of x
3552416 purely formal with no dependence on the content of what is asserted
3552417 if x is to the west of y then y is to the east of x
3552418 with a closing parenthesis is interpreted as a smiley if you stick a space in between them it should fix things they have been fixed
3552419 if we are looking for a suppressed premise to carry the authority of the inference and that authority is to be purely formal then we cant even use the words
3552420 any x to the west of y is also a y to the east of x
3552421 any x to the west of y is also a y to the east of x
3552422 every materially valid inference is in fact a logically valid inference with some premises suppressed specifically there are suppressed premises that convert the inference into a logically valid one and moreover the reasoners material understanding of the terms used in the inference will lead her to assent to these suppressed premises

3552445 well see if the notices go out and well act accordingly
3552446 it is well that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and
3552447 give me control of a nations money and i care not who makes its laws
3552448 history records that the money changers have used every form of abuse intrigue deceit and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and its issuance
3552449 if congress has the right under the constitution to issue paper money it was given them to use themselves not to be delegated to individuals or corporations
3552450 the government should create issue and circulate all the currency and credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers by the adoption of these principles the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity
3552451 when president wilson signs this bill the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalized
3552452 the federal reserve banks are one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever seen there is not a man within the sound of my voice who does not know that this nation is run by the international bankers
3552453 i have never seen more senators express discontent with their jobs i think the major cause is that deep down in our hearts we have been accomplices in doing something terrible and unforgiveable to our wonderful country deep down in our heart we know that we have given our children a legacy of bankruptcy we have defrauded our country to get ourselves elected
3552454 a great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit our system of credit is privately concentrated the growth of the nation therefore and all our activities are in the hands of a few men who even if their action be honest and intended for the public interest are necessarily concentrated upon the great undertakings in which their own money is involved and who necessarily by very reason of their own limitations chill and check and destroy genuine economic freedom
3552455 we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3552456 most americans have no real understanding of the operation of the international money lenders the accounts of the federal reserve system have never been audited it operates outside the control of congress and manipulates the credit of the united states
3552457 why of course the people dont want war why should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3552458 all this was inspired by the principle which is quite true in itself that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large scale falsehoods it would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation for the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it even after it has been nailed down a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying these people know only too well how to use falsehood for the basest purposes
3552459 but it is now known that the assassination robbed the united states of its chief contact
3552460 the united states came and started supporting a man named diem who turned out to be one of the most ruthless dictators in the history of the world he set out to silence all opposition the peasants watched as all this was presided over by united states influence and then by increasing numbers of united states troops who came to help quell the insurgency that diems methods had aroused we increased our troop commitments in support of governments which were singularly corrupt inept and without popular support now they languish under our bombs and consider us their real enemy they move sadly and apathetically we herd them off the land of their fathers into concentration camps they know they must move or be destroyed by our bombs
3552461 we were not attacking the soviet union and cias activities we were attacking people in the third world they undertake operations in every corner of the globe they undertook the license of operating totally above and beyond u s law they had a license to kill license to smuggle drugs 3 000 major operations and over 10 000 minor operations everyone of them illegal everyone of them disruptive of the lives and societies of other peoples and many of them bloody and gory beyond comprehension we manipulated and organized the overthrow of functioning constitutional democracies in other countries we organized secret armies and directed them to fight in just about every continent in the world we encouraged ethnic minorities to rise up and fight
3552462 the money powers prey upon the nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity the banking powers are more despotic than a monarchy more insolent than autocracy more selfish than bureaucracy
3552463 banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough money to buy it back again take this great power away from them and all great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for then this would be a better and happier world to live in but if you want to continue to be slaves of the banks and pay the cost of your own slavery then let bankers continue to create money and control credit

3552500 it is very difficult to imagine that the georgians launched their attack against u s wishes
3552501 when the united states went so far as to suggest that georgia be included as well bringing nato deeper into the caucasus the russian conclusion publicly stated was that the united states in particular intended to encircle and break russia
3552502 to establish that western guarantees including nato membership meant nothing in the face of russian power

3552504 t he middle eastern wars have left the united states off balance and short on resources as we have written this conflict created a window of opportunity the russian goal is to use that window to assert a new reality throughout the region while the americans are tied down elsewhere and dependent on the russians

3552529 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3552530 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3552531 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
3552532 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
3552533 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed

3552570 we love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
3552571 i was with him when he was released and he was cooperative
3552572 he was also cooperative while he was in custody and when he was arrested it was without incident
3552573 it is the gender stereotypes that they are imposing the focus on skin care nail care hair care it objectifies women these are things women fought against for centuries theyve got no place in a public school
3552574 her chin was almost entirely cut off she had a huge gash in her arm that looked like a really deep wound that was bleeding profusely
3552575 she asked me to hold her and i could feel a lot of gashes in her back as well
3552576 from my perspective this is simply not a time for politics as usual
3552577 the prospect that well have more of the same that is the source of angst of many republicans around the country
3552578 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3552579 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3552580 we are proceeding and the president is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3552581 theyve got a gold and a bronze in the swimming and i think its a long time since theyve done that
3552582 they seem to be getting there for a country that has very few swimming pools and not much soap
3552583 obviously the australian swimmers didnt do well mustve been the shackles dragging them down

3552589 oh ive never been to california i just read about it on wikipedia
3552590 the premier requested that council come back with a proposed design and an estimated costing
3552591 this could possibly see further international events here in bathurst similar to those at phillip island
3552592 bathurst regional council has made no decision at this point about a second track
3552593 the upgraded facility will help council achieve its target of diverting 60 per cent of waste from landfill by 2014 and make it easier for users of the facility
3552594 in bathurst we currently divert 40 per cent of waste collected from landfill which is not a bad result
3552595 however we still have to make continual improvements to our facilities to ensure we can deliver greater environmental outcomes in the future
3552596 at first my husband couldnt find the 122 heavily pregnant ewes anywhere
3552597 once he went looking he started finding carcass after carcass each covered in blood and with huge chunks out of them others were cowering away and clearly distressed
3552598 weve brought some back and put them in pens to try and save them but they will probably have to be put down they cant even stand up at the moment and dont want to eat
3552599 we genuinely care for our stock so imagine coming out on sunday morning and finding this
3552600 rural lands protection board district veterinarian bruce watt came out and assessed the situation
3552601 it was such a savage attack that he said it was one of the worst dog attacks hed ever seen
3552602 i am upset hurt and angry it must have been living hell out there for the sheep i cant imagine the horror the sheep went through
3552603 an incident like this really highlights the need for responsible pet ownership
3552604 maybe its a result of the emergence of the hobby farmer but people have to realise they need to keep their dogs chained up at night so they dont go wandering
3552605 the police have been out as well and they will be asking other property owners if they know anything about what happened
3552606 whoever owns the dogs will know because they would have turned up on sunday covered in blood
3552607 you hear about these things happening but you never thing its going to be you
3552608 i never thought people could be so irresponsible or thoughtless
3552609 the board is working closely with bathurst regional council to increase the awareness of people living in rural areas of their requirements under the companion animals act
3552610 its a very sad moment he was a very close friend and political mentor of mine
3552611 i had been to perth recently to visit him as he hadnt been well for some time
3552612 im very saddened to hear of his passing as he was a great warrior for the labor party and this area
3552613 the mathworks development organization responsible for developing the real time workshop embedded coder has been audited to assess its development and quality assurance procedures
3552614 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3552615 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3552616 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3552617 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3552618 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3552619 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3552620 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3552621 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3552622 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3552623 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3552624 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3552625 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3552626 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3552627 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3552628 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3552629 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3552630 its already a well established truth that dani is an obnoxious arrogant hateful and spiteful woman everything she writes evidences that fact i post anonymously because small minded haters like dani always try to divert the issues by attacking the messenger my message is not the issue the issue is this addle minded loathsome hack you spreads sic her hatred all over the internet lindsay your thinly veiled malice and hatred is beginning to show so ill say something very simple the vile attitude the arrogance the malice and the hatred the dani expresses in virtually everything she writes is not at all like jesus not at all now are you going to try to disagree with that are you going to lie and say that she doesnt call people who disagree with her every nasty and vile name she can think of are you going to try to say that shes not a drone of that twisted pervert bob enyart open your eyes lindsay just open your eyes being a christian does not mean being anything like dani
3552631 enyart and his arrogant hateful drones are a disgrace to christianity enyart is a sick sick hypocrite and its pretty obvious that his drones are just as sick hateful and perverted as he is
3552632 curtis amp dani are desperately trying to exorcise their demons of promiscuity homosexuality amp lesbianism and whatever other problems theyre so deeply immersed in i believe theyre christians insofar as they affirm that jesus is the christ the son of the living god but they sure dont talk or act like jesus
3552633 wow such hatred such christ like hatred you dont worship the lord you worship hateful psychopaths like bob enyart honestly i feel very very sorry for your home of hatred really i do such hateful tripe from somebody who presents herself as the paragon of christian love purity and grace dani you should be ashamed of yourself but alas youre not youre actually proud and boastful about your nastiness i grieve for you and your children
3552634 i do honestly fear and i mean fear for dani amp curtis kids wow if they turn out anything like their parents they will be screwed up hate filled arrogant abusive and uncivil and that is not what we need more of
3552635 what are you stupid no reason to read any further into her blog folks anything that starts out with this kind of idiotic paragraph is sure to be pure garbage
3552636 dani you are an utter moron one post after another betrays the fact that you simply do not know what youre talking about wow just wow you sicken me
3552637 were i not already a christian i can promise you most assuredly that i would never be won to the lord as a result of the nasty behavior of people like bob enyart jo scott curtis amp dani and their ilk i have to wonder if these people truly are christians or if theyve merely found a new way to vent all their pent up rage malice and hatred
3552638 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3552639 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3552640 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3552641 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3552642 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3552643 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3552644 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3552645 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3552646 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3552647 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3552648 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3552649 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3552650 who are open to doing something on the production side
3552651 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3552652 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3552653 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3552654 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3552655 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3552656 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3552657 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3552658 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3552659 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3552660 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3552661 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3552662 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3552663 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3552664 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3552665 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3552666 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3552667 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3552668 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3552669 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3552670 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3552671 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3552672 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3552673 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3552674 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3552675 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3552676 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3552677 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3552678 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3552679 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3552680 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3552681 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3552682 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3552683 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3552684 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3552685 that was the main reason i was able to play so far into the playoffs
3552686 ive always played well in north carolina and i love the style of golf here
3552687 cuban would be a great fit to join cubs family
3552688 the commissioners office abhors owners who speak their minds and fight for the rights of their respective franchises of no one better suited to reverse the fortunes of the cubs for the long term
3552689 es sieht nicht so aus als ob sie dazugeh rte
3552690 die kugel war nicht f r meine tante bestimmt sondern f r jemand anderen
3552691 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3552692 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3552693 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3552694 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3552695 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3552696 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3552697 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3552698 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3552699 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3552700 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3552701 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3552702 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3552703 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3552704 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3552705 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3552706 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3552707 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3552708 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3552709 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3552710 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3552711 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3552712 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3552713 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3552714 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3552715 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3552716 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3552717 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3552718 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3552719 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3552720 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3552721 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3552722 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3552723 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3552724 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3552725 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3552726 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3552727 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3552728 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand
3552729 french polynesia does not forget either that it is also under french polynesia and the observer status for wallis and futuna
3552730 has given new foundations to the pacific islands forum and also made a reality the arrival of
3552731 beyond his special human qualities his great sensitivity to the numerous cultures that express themselves in the great pacific area and within the forum his proven skills we would like to remember above all else his commitment to the advancement of the french pacific communities integration within this organization
3552732 i would be completely in error not to say that my time in as secretary general has been a period of enormous satisfaction overall one for which i can only express my thanks to all of those who made it possible
3552733 critical in my absolute view to the business of showing all of our regional organizations to work most effectively and concertedly with each other rather than continue to be prone to pull against one another something which despite a good deal of effort on our own part we remain something of a captive to
3552734 it has also included in a very integral way the complex far reaching work we have been doing in the area of trade relations of fisheries as regards the eu but also as regards picta and further down the track the whole issue of pacer the pacer picta issues important in themselves will again have it seems to me a direct reinforcing effort on the whole effort we are making to strengthen our regional integration
3552735 let me conclude by thanking you the foc members and the forum secretariat for all youve done in the service of our wonderful region it has been an honour and a privilege to work with you all let us take this work forward together

3552998 local councils can find out the number and cause of avoidable contacts which is the first step to reducing them
3552999 the fact that simple transactions are increasingly satisfied by consumer self service internet and automatic voice response systems means person to person contacts tend to be more complex and take longer
3553000 reducing avoidable contact gives more capacity to handle unavoidable contacts more effectively and reduce overall workload
3553001 saya mengapresiasi kalau mui mau mengeluarkan fatwa haram merokok yang berdampak terhadap perlindungan anak anak di indonesia karena selama batas makruh berarti jika dikerjakan mendapat cela jika tidak dikerjakan tidak apa apa padahal dari segi kesehatan lebih banyak negatifnya

3553079 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3553080 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3553081 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3553082 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3553083 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3553084 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3553085 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3553086 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3553087 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3553088 blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
3553089 blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you
3553090 as i swore in my wrath they shall not enter my rest
3553091 and god rested on the seventh day from all his works
3553092 today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts
3553093 actually i believe that atheism can include a moral compass independent from religion and seeing as i believe in the inherent goodness of humanity i believe that people have an innate sense of right and wrong and do not necessarily need the church to tell them which each are that is a person is moral because of their sense of right and wrong not out of fear of the repercussions of immorality not that spiritual morality is wrong its just not the only type of morality and atheist morality is not necessarily bad while i consider myself christian i have many atheist friends who wholeheartedly believe in the immorality of rape and pedophillia sp likewise there are many people who profess a believe in christs teachings who are rapists and child molesters i hope i manage to state my opinions clearly and without sounding confrontational just a in no way speaking from a religious point of view while i consider myself spiritually christian it doesnt altogether play an important role in my moral decsions
3553094 i believe in one god the father almighty maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible and in one lord jesus christ the only begotten son of god begotten of the father before all worlds god of god light of light very god of very god begotten not made being of one substance with the father by whom all things were made who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the holy spirit of the virgin mary and was made man and was crucified also for us under pontius pilate he suffered and was buried and the third day he rose again according to the scriptures and ascended into heaven and sits on the right hand of the father and he shall come again with glory to judge the quick and the dead whose kingdom shall have no end and i believe in the holy ghost the lord and giver of life who proceeds from the father and the son who with the father and the son together is worshipped and glorified who spoke by the prophets and i believe one holy catholic and apostolic church i acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins and i look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come amen
3553095 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
3553096 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3553097 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3553098 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3553099 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3553100 i built a studio in my basement using shower curtains and mattresses and i just put everything into my writing

3553102 i had been very uncooperative about living in honduras and i very purposefully had not learned the language i didnt really embrace the culture and even when i wanted to learn spanish there was a subliminal block there and it just took forever

3553104 i cant put something out unless its something i can stand behind 100 percent
3553105 i wouldnt consider myself a songwriter necessarily i really see myself more of a storyteller

3553107 i didnt want this album to sound like any other
3553108 i didnt want anyone say to that the production reminds them of someone else i wanted it to stand on its own
3553109 we tried to make it interesting but also easy to listen to
3553110 i stayed in this hotel in spokane and there was blood on the shower curtain then at 3 a m someone was jumping against my door trying to get it open
3553111 then in nashville i got to watch an actual drug bust from my room at night
3553112 if i had not moved to honduras id probably still be in oklahoma wanting to do what im doing now but without the time or the energy to make it happen fortunately ive gotten to live a very exciting life

3553126 can we cut any one of these out of the list and proclaim it alone as the means of salvation can we be saved without faith without gods grace without repentance without baptism without the spirit these are all involved and necessary not one of them can be dismissed as a means of obtaining eternal life neither can one be emphasized to the exclusion of another they are all involved in salvation and entry into the church the catholic church does not divide these various elements of salvation up overemphasizing some while ignoring others rather she holds them all in their fullness

3553176 our neighbour thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3553177 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3553178 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner

3553228 forget harvard one of the worlds best undergraduate colleges is in iran
3553229 in 2003 administrators at stanford universitys electrical engineering department were startled when a group of foreign students aced the notoriously difficult ph d entrance exam getting some of the highest scores ever
3553230 that the whiz kids werent american wasnt odd students from asia and elsewhere excel in us programs the surprising thing say stanford administrators is that the majority came from one country and one school the sharif university of science and technology in iran
3553231 iranian students from sharif and other top schools such as the university of tehran and the isfahan university of technology have also become major players in the international science olympics taking home trophies in physics mathematics chemistry and robotics
3553232 the silicon valley companies from google to yahoo now employ hundreds of iranian grads as do research institutes throughout the west olympiad winners are especially attractive according to the iranian press up to 90 percent of them now leave the country for graduate school or work abroad

3553235 the most severe security flaw ever discovered in a voting system
3553236 as more government services move toward the internet you end up with more exposure to these types of attack whether it was an organization and executed by government or criminal elements acting at somebodys direction
3553237 its hard to prove it was a government directed operation
3553238 it looks like it was coming from russia or is it a co opted server that wasnt properly patched with people taking over the computer and doing things with it
3553239 with the russian business network you can rent out a server or a botnet for a number of hours you pay your cyber gold and these transactions happen offshore thats one of the challenges that governments face
3553240 its a brute force attack one that goes all the way back to the mafiaboy attacks of 2000
3553241 this is not a verifiable cyber war but it is clearly a step in that direction
3553242 you appear to be okay but im a little concerned about that scoff
3553243 hes somebody we feel like can be dependable for us
3553244 we know what were going to get every fifth day it just seems like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer given the fact that wakes on the dl colon is still rehabbing and buchholz is still working through some things you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3553245 suffice to say it will be an organizational player and not a prospect
3553246 im really excited about being on a team that has a chance to win it all
3553247 i think the red sox have a great thing going so its hard to be disappointed i have no fear or wonder about which pitcher is going to show up
3553248 by no means are we giving up on clay buchholz
3553249 hes going to be a huge part of our future and may well prove to be an important part of our present with that said to make this move gives us the freedom to do the right thing in our rotation rather than maybe force people into roles because of injury but by no means is clay buchholz out of our picture
3553250 there are going to be days when we have to sit him
3553251 there are going to be days when its feeling better than others but his presence in the lineup is so important that well take whatever we can get from him

3553265 any additional cost or time arising out of a new arrangement is a matter for the government of the day to sort out and deal with not them
3553266 their job is to get on with it and stop concerning themselves about the possibility of change they can cross that bridge when we come to it so until then they have no excuse what so ever for not being ready

3553288 the former policy adopted in 1990 tracked the equal employment opportunity commissions definition of sexual harassment
3553289 is a harassment policy that is so vaguely worded and so broad in its language that really university administrators were able to punish any sort of speech that they deemed offensive and mr dejohn was troubled by that and felt he couldnt really express his opinions in class and with his friends and so he felt it was really important to challenge this policy and get it overturned

3553314 the trusts defensive qualities will ensure that it is well placed to perform strongly in the more challenging environment we face with uncertainties in global financial markets and high interest rates
3553315 there is some evidence to suggest that property values around the world are coming under pressure and it is therefore possible that the trust may face asset devaluations in the future
3553316 we expect that any downward movement in the trusts property values would be reasonably contained given the quality of the trusts portfolio

3553356 the good dimension is that there has been progress in the decline of infant and child mortality rates if you compare it from the 1970s to date
3553357 many countries are on track to achieving the millennium development goal of reducing infant and child mortality by two thirds by 2015
3553358 this progress has tended to taper off in the last 15 to 17 years the 70s and 80s saw a much more rapid decline

3553369 everythings been great its everything i imagined it to be and more every week shes doing something new shes starting to interact with us and its fun to see the way shes developing
3553370 that was probably toughest stretch ive ever had to go through in my career i definitely dont want to be part of that again obviously i missed the playoffs with the panthers but its different when youre expected to be in the playoffs and dont make it than when i was in florida and there really were no expectations
3553371 you want to make sure that this year were ready from the start and we get things off on the right foot so that we can build on good things right away and not have to fall behind the 8 ball like we did last year
3553372 i was really sad to see guys like markus and brendan leave the team they were there before i arrived and they were a really big part of the franchise and they were great guys to be friends with it was really sad for me to see those guys go but unfortunately thats part of the business
3553373 at the same time weve got some new guys in and im anxious to get things going and see what kind of statement we can make this year
3553374 those are the types of guys you want to have on your team and in the locker room they have big hearts and they play hard every night those are the kind of players you need on a team
3553375 this will be my third year with the team every year that im there i feel more comfortable and i feel my position as a leader takes on a bit of a bigger role obviously we lost some key guys as far as leadership in the locker room so itll be me and a couple of other guys who are going to have to step up in that department
3553376 we have one of the top defensive corps in the league when everybodys healthy so theres no reason why we cant be competing with the top teams in the league for me personally thats the way i look at it
3553377 the main thing is trying to stay healthy all year
3553378 actually international law is recognized in the constitution as part of the law of the land and international law allows a more liberal and flexible approach to the peace process this is my reading of the impasse in the peace process

3553380 to me the great challenge is for our political leaders and parties to transcend narrow partisan advantage and unite with our moro brothers and sisters for peace and the common good
3553381 as a united nations university consultant to ambassador emmanuel pelaez in 1987 in his role as head of the government peace panel i recall the negotiations with nur s mnlf and conrado balwegs cordillera peopples liberation army this gave me my first personal involvement in the peace process that was 21 years ago

3553392 this year were heading into our third year and i expect the offense to be dominant and i think they expect that of themselves they have a lot of seniors a lot of veterans and should be ready to go
3553393 the first five days we basically dont have depth charts
3553394 they are going to earn their positions on the field and then were going to look to have the best 11 players on the field
3553395 we have enough new players on the defense that im not 100 percent sure where all of the new players fit in
3553396 thats what well be looking at in the first few days
3553397 im looking forward to just seeing the competition on the field
3553398 i really am any time you can get good competition at a position its a good thing and we have that

3553406 following on from some of the news about rexs performance we believe the area deserves a competitive and reliable service on the tarmac and that is exactly what we want to provide
3553407 they rex have had time to provide a good service and the point is pretty obvious that they have not done that despite the fares they expect people to pay i guarantee our fares will always be cheaper than rex
3553408 when it pulled up at the airport terminal it pretty much made the rex plane look like a toy its a big plane thats for sure much larger than the current 30 seats that are on offer so the capacity is there to really increase the number of people we bring into this city each year

3553415 the mou was scheduled for review so we have been examining what aspects of the cooperative management can be improved

3553514 after conferring with our attorneys we are confident that typhoons claim of owning the patent to
3553515 based on the way our supreme court has previously ruled i think that the typhoon touch technologies lawsuit will be invalidated in 2007 in the case of
3553516 typhoon touch technologies acquired their patents out of bankruptcy court and is trying to expand the coverage that the original patent owner and applicant microslate inc applied for in 1997
3553517 tabletkiosk fully respects and value the intricacies and merits of patent law and licensing which protect new inventions and emerging technologies and intellectual properties in fact some of these licenses are key components of our products however in this case i do not consider the umbrella grouping of mobile touch screen technology to be a concrete asset that can be owned by one person or group
3553518 i was shocked to see that they made this claim in their release we did not and have no intention of entering into settlement talks with typhoon yes our attorney contacted their lawyers to explain our defense however typhoon immediately rejected our claim and we never discussed settlement
3553519 we are excited to work with tabletkiosk on this joint project

3553526 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3553527 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby

3553551 the understated leadership of both dr drummond and dr affleck their hard work and their unwavering commitment to advocate at both the federal and provincial level in pushing for critical improvements in the emergency department are a model for others to emulate
3553552 having worked in emergency medicine for 22 years emergency department overcrowding for me became the single most important barrier to providing proper patient care
3553553 the issue had grown to the point where the effects were experienced on literally every shift the impact affected not only ed care but admitted patients and was the main contributor to physicians and nurses leaving the ed
3553554 i enjoy the work i do and simply wanted to be an advocate for the patients and ed staff and make a contribution that would change the ed environment
3553555 i am deeply honoured to be recognized by my peers but far more importantly i view this award as an important acknowledgement by the profession that ed overcrowding is indeed a significant and serious public health threat that undermines the confidence of canadians in the integrity of their health care system
3553556 for most canadians their highly valued almost iconic universal health care system is all about timely access to quality care when its needed most perhaps within our life time we will see ed overcrowding relegated to being simply a historical anomaly

3553589 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3553613 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3553617 a mass of detail in the early sources shows that he was an honest and upright man who had gained the respect and loyalty of others who were likewise honest and upright men
3553618 the 100 a ranking of the most influential persons in history
3553619 my choice of muhammad to lead the list of the worlds most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others but he was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular level
3553620 head of the state as well as the church he was caesar and pope in one but he was pope without the popes claims and caesar without the legions of caesar without a standing army without a bodyguard without a palace without a fixed revenue if ever any man had the right to say that he ruled by a right divine it was mohammad for he had all the power without instruments and without its support he cared not for dressing of power the simplicity of his private life was in keeping with his public life
3553621 philosopher orator apostle legislator warrior conqueror of ideas restorer of rational dogmas of a cult without images the founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual empire that is muhammad as regards all standards by which human greatness may be measured we may well ask is there any man greater than he
3553622 he must be called the savior of humanity i believe that if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it much needed peace and happiness
3553623 the personality of muhammad it is most difficult to get into the whole truth of it only a glimpse of it i can catch what a dramatic succession of picturesque scenes there is muhammad the prophet there is muhammad the warrior muhammad the businessman muhammad the statesman muhammad the orator muhammad the reformer muhammad the refuge of orphans muhammad the protector of slaves muhammad the emancipator of women muhammad the judge muhammad the saint all in all these magnificent roles in all these departments of human activities he is alike a hero
3553624 i wanted to know the best of one who holds today undisputed sway over the hearts of millions of mankind i became more than convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for islam in those days in the scheme of life it was the rigid simplicity the utter self effacement of the prophet the scrupulous regard for his pledges his intense devotion to his friends and followers his intrepidity his fearlessness his absolute trust in god and in his own mission these and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle when i closed the 2nd volume of the prophets biography i was sorry there was not more for me to read of the great life
3553625 how one man single handedly could weld warring tribes and wandering bedouins into a most powerful and civilized nation in less than two decades
3553626 muhammad was the soul of kindness and his influence was felt and never forgotten by those around him
3553627 it was the first religion that preached and practiced democracy for in the mosque when the call for prayer is sounded and worshippers are gathered together the democracy of islam is embodied five times a day when the peasant and king kneel side by side and proclaim god alone is great i have been struck over and over again by this indivisible unity of islam that makes man instinctively a brother
3553628 the league of nations founded by the prophet of islam put the principle of international unity and human brotherhood on such universal foundations as to show candle to other nations
3553629 the fact is that no nation of the world can show a parallel to what islam has done towards the realization of the idea of the league of nations
3553630 i believe in one god and mahomet an apostle of god is the simple and invariable profession of islam the intellectual image of the deity has never been degraded by any visible idol the honor of the prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtues and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason and religion
3553631 he is a prophet and not a poet and therefore his koran is to be seen as divine law and not as a book of a human being made for education or entertainment
3553632 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3553633 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3553634 you know what i was an ahole when i was using and i am really sorry for the things i did
3553635 he who forgiveth and is reconciled unto his enemy shall receive his reward from god for he loveth not the unjust doers
3553636 sincere forgiveness isnt colored with expectation that the other person apologize or change dont worry whether or not they finally understand you love them and release them life feeds back truth to people in its own way and time
3553637 the past our cradle not our prison there is danger as well as appeal in its glamour the past is for inspiration not imitation for continuation not repetition
3553638 i can forgive but i cannot forget is only another way of saying i will not forgive forgiveness ought to be like a cancelled note torn in two and burned up so that it never can be shown against one
3553639 the remarkable thing is that we really love our neighbor as ourselves we do unto others as we do unto ourselves we hate others when we hate ourselves we are tolerant toward others when we tolerate ourselves we forgive others when we forgive ourselves we are prone to sacrifice others when we are ready to sacrifice ourselves
3553640 when you forgive you in no way change the past but you sure do change the future
3553641 forgiveness is the fragrance the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it
3553642 anger makes you smaller while forgiveness forces you to grow beyond what you were
3553643 if you havent forgiven yourself something how can you forgive others
3553644 wherefore receive ye one another as christ also received us to the glory of god
3553645 therefore accept each other just as christ has accepted you so that god will be given glory
3553646 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us
3553647 looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god
3553648 how do we strip off every weight that slows us down especially the sin that so easily trips us up
3553649 great is his faithfulness his mercies begin afresh each morning
3553650 for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds
3553651 ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin
3553652 whatever problem youre facing hasnt caused you to die christ didnt give up why should you keep on going you can do it
3553653 and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth
3553654 for the lord disciplines those he loves and he punishes each on he accepts as his child
3553655 if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons
3553656 were being punished because were gods children so lets do this because of what he did for us
3553657 furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness
3553658 hey we respected our earthly fathers shouldnt we give even more respect to the father of heaven and earth our fathers on earth did an okay job disciplining us but gods discipline is always good
3553659 now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peacheable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby
3553660 wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed

3553667 we were quite surprised and honored by the request the bride to be is quite excited about her original gift idea and we are determined to ensure the guitar lives up to her expectations
3553668 we had a lot of people coming up after mass and saying that theyre very proud of us that we need more people like you
3553669 we got a lot of people who were very encouraged by us which is i think the best thing that can happen when we get into these parishes that it encourages these strong pro life people to keep up to keep fighting
3553670 it was the kind of witness that i was really excited about doing it was a radical thing to do i knew that a lot of people would see us and i knew that that kind of prayer and sacrifice is whats needed for this issue i knew when i went to college that i wanted to do missionary work to spend my summers that way
3553671 it fosters community within ourselves it teaches us how to live with each other and how to be the phrase i like from jpii variety in unity it teaches us to honor each others individuality and uniqueness while also being of one mind living together with the 12 people like we did taught us that

3553679 the commonwealth fully supports action by the federal government to permit ms ingleson to remain in the united states and her continued residence in the commonwealth
3553680 the essential theme here is that this is a lady who had one contact with the law in her entire life
3553681 she was a law abiding person before this happened she has been a law abiding since this has happened she has worked hard and played by the rules

3553738 russian jets have carried out strikes on military targets in the central georgian town of gori close to the breakaway region of south ossetia
3553739 georgian officials say 60 people were killed when bombs hit two blocks of flats in the town
3553740 the comments came after russian commanders announced they were sending more troops into south ossetia
3553741 after days of exchanging heavy fire with the russian backed separatists georgian forces launched a surprise attack on thursday night to regain control of the region which has had de facto independence since the end of a civil war in 1992
3553742 in response moscow sent armoured units across the border russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said about 1 500 people had been killed so far including 15 of his countrys soldiers
3553743 georgia said russia had also launched air strikes on targets inside its territory in what it described as
3553744 the uk the us and france are pinpointing what they say is russias aggression as the key factor in the slide towards war while moscow insists georgia is to blame
3553745 they took a convenient time to attack such a small country
3553746 i had to go to the likes of infowars com and watch russia today to get the full story
3553747 lets see some facts and how it present on us media
3553748 and some questions 1 what a hell with this world happen why real genocide with 2000 dead people is not interesting to world media
3553749 2 people please why you so love story about russian aggressors why you dont see who is real aggressor
3553750 separatists opened fire at the two georgian villages of prisi and tamarasheni
3553751 tbilisi earlier said the shelling of south ossetias capital tskhinvali and a neighboring village had been provoked by the rebel region south ossetias leader said monday at least 300 north ossetians had already arrived in the breakaway region with up to 2 000 expected
3553752 a georgian armoured personnel carrier was destroyed by south ossetian militants near the village of avnevi one hour ago and three georgian peacekeepers were wounded as a result
3553753 it said shooting came from three ethnic georgian villages but georgia blamed the separatists for provoking the clashes
3553754 this is another attempt by the separatist side to involve georgia in a military conflict
3553755 that scenario started unfolding in south ossetia in late july by august 6 and 7 heavily armed proxy troops opened fire on georgian villages while the secessionist authorities refused to talk with tbilisi the attacking forces began destroying the transmission antennae of georgian mobile telephone systems arms and paramilitary groups poured in from russia to south ossetia through the russian controlled roki tunnel russian officials in georgia claimed that the attacking forces were out of russias control officials in moscow meanwhile justified the attacks directly and indirectly by accusing georgia of aggression interfax itar tass russian television august 4 7

3553757 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3553758 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3553759 when you have very thin relations it doesnt give you a lot of diplomatic tools
3553760 there are not a lot of things in terms of u s russian cooperation that we can threaten to stop that the russians care about
3553761 two reuters reporters in gori said they saw no evidence of a substantial russian presence in the town
3553762 although the ossetians had their own language ossetian russian and georgian were administrative state languages
3553763 as we can see since 1801 south osetia is part of russia but since 1922 south osetia stands
3553764 with the rising of ethnic tensions in south ossetia in the late 1980s the 1918 20 thematic surfaced again with conflicting narratives and interpretations of the conflict
3553765 we were sitting on the ground when a group of georgian bombers flew overhead
3553766 they started dropping bombs everywhere one landed right near us we thought we were going to die what will we do now we have nothing no money no clothes where will they go to school what can we do
3553767 as usual the bbc is twisting and distorting the news coming out of the georgia region we keep being told that around 1500 have been killed in georgia the inference being that this has resulted from russian bombing not so the casualties are in ossetia

3553771 the redskins and soldiers could plainly see each other from mountaintop to mountaintop beyond the possible range of any arms that either had the indians felt secure and the whites were merely carrying out a strategic plan

3553776 this is going to hurt a lot of people and someones going to end up dying
3553777 we want these soldiers to rest among their comrades and near an active army post
3553778 thats a lot harder than trying to run a governing board we need some help

3553780 roadrunner records august 26th in north america and a day earlier internationally
3553781 whether or not its a toll road or its not a toll road is inconsequential over the next twenty years youre going to see development more than double
3553782 to take an existing road thats already there and turn it into a toll road and say its an improvement i have some issues with that

3553784 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
3553785 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
3553786 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
3553787 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
3553788 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
3553789 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
3553790 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
3553791 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail

3553793 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
3553794 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
3553795 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
3553796 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
3553797 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies

3553803 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3553804 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3553805 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3553806 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3553807 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3553808 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3553809 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3553810 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3553811 people say i am against reconciliation the issue is not political its based on the constitution i am committed to reconciliation
3553812 its not out of love or hate for mohamed dheere that i reinstated him i can be replaced mohamed dheere can be replaced but the constitution cannot be changed
3553813 i hope the opposition will join the government so that somalia can get a political settlement
3553814 they attack the presidential palace and our houses forcing us to defend ourselves i dont know what kind of islamic faith allows women cleaners to be bombed i dont also understand why people should not fight off these elements
3553815 what i am is an advocate and one of the beauties of our form of government is that it gives us the right to stand up to our government and say its wrong we dont have to be afraid of being shot or imprisoned
3553816 i cant say i have ever had a challenge like this before
3553817 its the most inexperienced offensive line that i have ever been associated with but theyre good kids theyre willing to work but at this point we have a long long way to go
3553818 i had one of the very best offensive lines in college football if not the best
3553819 when i left ucla in 1995 our left tackle was jonathan ogden and his backup was kris farris and they both won the outland trophy

3553823 clem johnson broke his jaw in the scrimmage so hes out for maybe the year
3553824 the way he was playing he would have been the starter at safety for us with the way he was going its a big loss for us right now
3553825 your cv lists skills in both c asp net and java how does that work
3553826 i specialise in software development and therefore use whichever technology is most appropriate for the software being written or fits better into the overall technology strategy of the company it so happens that in my recent jobs the companies had applications written in both java and net and i had to work with both technologies in fact i am employed as a c developer but am asked to do java work also because i am the only developer with that versatility in the previous job it was the reverse i was officially a java developer but i ended up doing quite a lot of c development to help the team meet deadlines i even had to brush up my c skills to write setup utilities at the last minute in fact i would consider it a strength to have knowledge and practical experience of both technologies as for which one i would prefer to work with i actually dont have any preference java pays more and net development is a bit more exciting at the moment so send me job descriptions of any vacancies that you have and i will see if they appeal to me
3553827 cant we just remove java from your skillset to make it easier on potential employers
3553828 south ossetians supported by russians are committing horrible massacres in georgian villages
3553829 south ossetian separatists entered the village of disevi in gori district and committed acts of ethnic cleansing burning houses and attacking the population
3553830 we have been getting reports lately that groups near tskhinvali were entering villages previously under control of the georgian government and there have been killings rampages ethnic cleansing in the areas
3553831 we have credible reports of camps set up in vladikavkaz where people are interned of on site killings and of executions of innocent civilians
3553832 we have been getting different indications and reports of ethnic cleansing in upper abkhazia from which the whole population was thrown out and a number of people killed
3553833 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3553834 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3553835 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3553836 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3553837 you have the right to freedom and independence we are here to demonstrate our solidarity freedom is worth fighting for
3553838 but when it comes to his record american made motorcycles dont matter to john mccain back in washington mccain opposed a requirement that the government buy american made motorcycles

3553854 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3553855 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3553856 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3553857 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3553858 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

3553861 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3553862 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3553863 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3553864 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3553868 net broadband additions in the quarter were the fewest of any quarter in the seven years lrg has been tracking the industry
3553869 while the relative number of quarterly broadband adds has certainly peaked the decline in additions this quarter compared to the same period last year was exacerbated by verizon and at amp ts emphasis on selling higher speed fios and u verse bundled services often at the expense of the traditional dsl service
3553870 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace
3553871 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl cable modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
3553872 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3553873 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3553874 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3553875 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

3553877 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3553878 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3553879 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3553880 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3553881 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3553882 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3553883 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3553884 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3553885 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3553886 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3553887 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3553888 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3553889 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3553890 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3553891 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3553892 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3553893 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3553894 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3553895 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3553896 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3553897 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3553898 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

3553900 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3553901 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3553902 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3553903 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3553904 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3553905 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3553906 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3553907 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3553908 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3553909 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3553910 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3553911 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3553912 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3553913 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3553914 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3553915 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3553916 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3553917 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3553918 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3553919 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3553920 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3553921 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3553922 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3553923 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3553924 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3553925 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3553926 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3553927 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3553928 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3553929 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3553930 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation

3553945 we believe all that god has revealed all that he does now reveal and we believe that he will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the kingdom of god
3553946 how oft have i gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and have nourished you
3553947 we never can comprehend the things of god and of heaven but by revelation we may spiritualize and express opinions to all eternity but that is no authority
3553948 jesus in his teachings says upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it matthew 16 18 what rock revelation
3553949 jesus set in the church firstly apostles and secondly prophets for the work of the ministry perfecting of the saints etc the grand rule of heaven is that nothing should ever be done on earth without revealing the secret to his servants the prophets agreeable to amos 3 7
3553950 to our great grief we soon found that satan had been lying in wait to deceive and seeking whom he might devour brother hiram page had in his possession a certain stone by which he had obtained certain revelations concerning the upbuilding of zion the order of the church etc all of which were entirely at variance with the order of gods house as laid down in the new testament as well as in our late revelations as a conference meeting had been appointed for the 26th day of september i thought it wisdom not to do much more than to converse with the brethren on the subject until the conference should meet finding however that many especially the whitmer family and oliver cowdery were believing much in the things set forth by this stone we thought best to inquire of the lord concerning so important a matter and before the conference convened we received the following
3553951 and thou shalt not command him who is at thy head and at the head of the church for i have given him the keys of the mysteries and the revelations which are sealed until i shall appoint unto them another in his stead
3553952 for all things must be done in order and by common consent in the church by the prayer of faith d amp c 28 2 3 6 7 11 13
3553953 until i shall appoint unto them another in his stead
3553954 it is contrary to the economy of god for any member of the church or any one to receive instructions for those in authority higher than themselves therefore you will see the impropriety of giving heed to them but if any person have a vision or a visitation from a heavenly messenger it must be for his own benefit and instruction for the fundamental principles government and doctrine of the church are vested in the keys of the kingdom

3553983 some of whom had expressed concern about the new contract provisions relative to paid holidays
3553984 in an effort to be responsive tyson asked the union to reopen the contract to address the holiday issue and the union agreed to do so
3553985 this means that in 2008 only shelbyville employees will have nine paid holidays
3553986 will have the option of selecting another day as a paid personal day at their discretion
3553987 the amended contract will be extended throughout the life of the current labor agreement and will recognize the following eight
3553988 the union is pleased that the will of the workers in shelbyville to observe and celebrate eid al fitr will be guaranteed as a paid holiday
3553989 the rwdsu believes that this is an important sign of respect of deeply held religious beliefs this labor day the workers at shelbyville have more reason than ever to be proud of being part of a union
3553990 this is not the image we want from tyson foods
3553991 for over a hundred years labor day has stood as a symbol to honor the working men and women of this country but for the past few years traditions like labor day have been under attack this time its gone too far and we as patriotic americans must draw our line in the sand
3553992 but in america we do not need to allow substitutions and exceptions to our beloved heritage
3553993 and have asked them to reconsider their contract actions and work to restore americas image as a nation built on noble traditions
3553994 we must stand up for working people of shelbyville bedford county and all tennesseans stand up to defend our heritage rights and privileges in celebrating the american worker for all that they have done to make this country great
3553995 my impression was when i read it in the paper they should have that day labor day and if they want to take off that other day eid al fitr that should be up to the company
3553996 but i didnt think it was a good thing to do as a business
3553997 i think tyson needs to go back and reconsider this
3553998 they need to sit down and renegotiate this they had honorable intentions to try to do something for the plant but its a mistake
3553999 most of them think that when people come to america they should do as americans do instead of americans changing and adapting things the way they do in language traditions and all of that

3554003 theyre here they are part of the community they are part of the economy so its not like you can just tell them to leave but tyson is the reason why they are here they are attracted by them they come from different places to work here

3554092 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation the entire islanders organization looks forward to working with scott
3554093 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3554094 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future

3554096 sometimes i wish god didnt have so much faith in me
3554097 after looking at the punting charts and observing practice richard jackson has come on of late
3554098 i havent said much about the tight end position but they are all doing well we have six players in the mix right now michael palmer is the starter but akeem robinson brian linthicum and durell barry have also played well dwayne allen is a freshman who has looked good and kasey nobles has also had a good camp that position is important in our offense and we play a lot of tight ends it is not the glamour position like quarterback running back and receiver where we have a lot of high profile players
3554099 the incident is being investigated through the district attorneys internal affairs
3554100 the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3554101 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3554102 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3554103 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3554104 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3554105 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3554106 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3554107 i think not im terribly sorry its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long
3554108 look at indias green revolution it worked for a short time but now the price is being paid
3554109 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place as result of the over demand on irrigation because of the hybrid seeds and grains that have been produced which demand huge amounts of water
3554110 the water table has disappeared they have huge problems with water level with pesticide problems and complications which are now coming home to roost
3554111 look at western australia huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture
3554112 if you are not working with natural assistance you cause untold problems which become very expensive and very difficult to undo it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out
3554113 koreans dont seem to care about the environment very much

3554140 these special fish are very valuable as they bring social economic and environmental benefits to local communities
3554141 their sensitivity and need for a good quality environment means we need to work together with our partners to address the complex factors affecting them he said
3554142 the better sea trout and salmon fisheries strategy will help us focus our work over the next decade to be more efficient and effective its not just about us we need everyone with an interest in our rivers to work in partnership to help bring more sea trout and salmon into more rivers bringing more benefit
3554143 we have been consulted at all stages during the evolution of the strategy which is an excellent example of the environment agency involving partners in a major project
3554144 it is fitting that another partnership the blachford fish pass on the river yealm should be chosen for lord smith to launch the strategy opening up new spawning and juvenile areas to migratory fish is an essential part of managing and conserving fish stocks
3554145 the environment agency has joined forces with local fisheries and environmental interests to make this happen helping improve the rivers salmon and trout populations
3554146 if these kinds of operations continue against us in swat valley and in the tribal areas we will continue this
3554147 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3554148 if nothing is done there wont be any brown bears left in austria in a few years time its an endangered species
3554149 weve considered everything disease migration but some of our bears may also have been killed illegally
3554150 the harbor porpoise population is one of the most threatened species of whale and dolphin in europe and giving protection to this species was one of the primary objectives for the area
3554151 we believe what theyve done is illegal and risks the lives of fishermen
3554152 we have a very clear knowledge of this and are placing the stones next to the old reef effectively extending it there is no damage
3554153 my worry is that at a time when we had been hoping to reach an agreement with fishermen the greenpeace campaign does not help dialogue
3554154 some pro plastic surgery groups argue that liposuction is relatively safe but in fact many people have died from undergoing bariatric surgery

3554164 theres a problem if kids cant find some steps they can do independently
3554165 what doesnt work is being really rigid and overly concerned about getting everything perfect
3554166 the only thing is that because they have not been training for long and working together they need more time
3554167 a growing world needs more energy but at the same time we need to find new ways of managing carbon emissions to limit climate change continued investment in technology is one of the key ways we are able to address this challenge and continue to secure a profitable and sustainable future
3554168 to unlock the potential of the vast canadian oil sands deposits
3554169 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3554170 we considered that the department for environment food and rural affairs defra best practice guidance on environmental claims stated that green claims should not be vague or ambiguous for instance by simply trying to give a good impression about general concern for the environment claims should always avoid the vague use of terms such as sustainable green non polluting and so on
3554171 defra had made that recommendation because although sustainable was a widely used term the lack of a universally agreed definition meant that it was likely to be ambiguous and unclear to consumers because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that the ad was misleading
3554172 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise was wholly misleading
3554173 development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
3554174 meant helping to meet the worlds growing energy needs in economic social and environmentally responsible ways and that in all their operations they integrated economic environmental and social considerations into their business decision making
3554175 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3554176 if shell were serious about sourcing sustainable energy then they would be far better placed investing in renewable energy such as wind tidal or solar power
3554177 road mortality is a significant factor of influencing snake populations around the world
3554178 in southern alberta its particularly important because the snakes arent moving very fast across the roads and there is a huge amount of development
3554179 were trying to learn how we can design roads and plan for roadways that are going to have less of an impact on snakes

3554183 tsks proposal is uncall for he should have thought about it wisely before he made that dim witted statement
3554184 if this scenario had happened nine months ago he wouldnt have been captured or he would have asked for help and they would have let him go
3554185 thats a clear indication of the change of attitude taking place among tijuana police
3554186 at the current rate borrowing is more attractive than saving
3554187 the idea that the real cost of money is zero is usually founded on the idea that peoples incomes are rising at a relatively fast rate but at the moment wage growth is not high enough by itself
3554188 donne leur la main pour les mener vers dautres lendemains
3554189 weve been following oil and gas development in the amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes
3554190 when you look at where the oil and gas blocks are they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots almost as if by design and this is in one of the most if not the most biodiverse place on earth
3554191 the real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase because thats when the roads drilling and pipelines come in
3554192 theyre not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time
3554193 you could have each individual company thinking theyre being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you all of a sudden when you look at the bigger picture you have a sprawling road network
3554194 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3554195 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3554196 you dont tip at a cafeteria do you so why would you tip at a place like that maybe leave a couple of bucks on the table for the busboy
3554197 otherwise i might explode into flames my brother told me everyones going to be watching me ready to report if i undertip like the local politician
3554198 when you realize that the waitstaff depends on tips for the bulk of their income you know they really need it
3554199 its been so long since ive traveled i had to look up on the internet how much to tip the maid
3554200 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
3554201 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
3554202 30 fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some 50m and put at risk the governments crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day
3554203 we are working with the uk bee farmers association and are sponsoring research to the minimum value of 25 000 over the next 12 months to selectively breed a hardier bee that can better withstand parasites and diseases
3554204 we do not deny that honeybee health is at risk frankly if nothing is done about it the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years
3554205 research is vital into varroa bee breeding and the nosema parasite
3554206 we are talking about food security and world food supplies being put at risk
3554207 significant public funds are already provided to support this area of work but to ensure this intervention is effective it it vital that work is driven by a well thought out strategy agreed by all relevant parties
3554208 we found that the oil and gas blocks overlap perfectly with the most biodiverse part of the amazon for birds mammals and amphibians
3554209 the threat to amphibians is of particular concern because they are already the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide
3554210 the most dynamic situation is unfolding in the peruvian amazon
3554211 the elimination of new oil access roads could significantly reduce the impacts of most projects
3554212 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3554213 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognize that indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3554214 filling up with a tank of gas could soon have devastating consequences to rainforests their peoples and their species

3554219 the canary in the coal mine the little bird that exhibits distress and often dies from the first hint of poison gas
3554220 i would be concerned if we had no ipos and we had a big falloff on the companies entering the pipeline grabow said
3554221 many factors from high market volatility the slowdown in the world economy sustained high oil prices and overall uncertainty all combined to weaken the ipo pipeline for the second quarter
3554222 market performance needs to stabilize for at least a quarter before we hope to see stronger ipo pipeline activity
3554223 once the markets have stabilized we think there are a lot of companies out there that would like to enter that pipeline and start that process
3554224 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year
3554225 i just dont have a choice we simply dont know what type of swelling there would be or if there would be any residual effects the next day once you start wheeling and dealing on the knee everyones body reacts differently i could putt right now but im not going to do it

3554240 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything

3554251 high commodity prices allow commercial farmers in developed countries to cope with high fertiliser prices but rising food prices hurt subsistence farmers particularly in africa
3554252 people just cannot afford fertiliser they were in dire straits before but now the situation is worse
3554253 strong global demand for fertilisers is stretching current production capacity to its technical limits this situation will persist until new capacity comes on line
3554254 it can take 5 7 years to open a phosphate mine 10 years for a potash mine and three years for a major nitrogen plant
3554255 sadly it is the rich who are benefiting a great deal they are selling maize to the poor at exorbitant prices
3554256 rises in basic commodity prices should be good for small growers but we are seeing that agri business is reaping all the benefits it needs a fundamental reform of the way agriculture is managed as well as more sustainable farming
3554257 at the moment i have the summer to think about it

3554268 it is our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3554269 i know its hard for you to go grocery shopping please know how much it means to me that you keep this box stocked just for me
3554270 what are you most worried about what can i do to make life easier for you what can i do that would let you know how much i love you
3554271 he is lying about the timeline of the affair and other details about it
3554272 shes a beautiful beautiful person in an ugly position and i really feel for her
3554273 and i think i have never known someone so intent on integrity and honesty and openness
3554274 it was a mutually committed relationship and he persuaded her to believe so
3554275 in retrospect i dont know how sincere he was about it
3554276 i dont talk about these tabloids and these tabloid trash
3554277 i know its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
3554278 she would not have a baby with someone she didnt love and she loves him
3554279 its been a best kept little secret for us the last two years
3554280 its a shame to call a chum out of the yukon river a chum
3554281 it really has a remarkable flavor and i think it eats as well as coho and sockeye its really the king of chums
3554282 if anyone turns their noses up at the word chum well be able to say not this chum
3554283 make a very major distinction with the fish from any other salmon they have
3554284 they look at it as a totally different fish or different salmon
3554285 weve really had to examine what alternatives do we have
3554286 we had some actual customer comments that when theyve taken it home and grilled it they got an oil content taste and a buttery taste thats almost as high as what it would be for a regular king
3554287 youre supporting an economy youre supporting a people that have got a history and a culture that also goes with the fish everybody wins
3554288 we kind of went in with some hesitation that we werent going to think this was a fish that was usable for us
3554289 we cut into them and the meat color was really nice on them for us at the retail level having something like that a fairly consistent orange to red color really helps customers identify with quality
3554290 then to follow it up the fat striations in the belly cavity were really pronounced there were great white lines through there
3554291 we took some home all of us here and ate it and we were really satisfied with how much oil content there was when we cooked it it wasnt a challenge to cook it was a fantastic dining experience certainly on the mild side but theres a demand for that in the marketplace
3554292 no we dont do chums im not interested in those
3554293 they found the same things we found it just does not eat like a typical chum salmon
3554294 we didnt want to get into lets call it this or lets call it that
3554295 it may swing around toward the end of the week
3554296 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3554297 in the three and a half years barack obama has been in the senate with all respect there is very little evidence of that kind of bipartisan outreach
3554298 john mccain has lived it worked it done it thats why i think in the end which is election day which we hope is just the beginning there are going to be many more democrats who will vote for john mccain than republicans who will vote for barack obama
3554299 oh a new version came out lets make sure we add a chapter that covers the new features
3554300 open for business is a short erotic anthology of twenty two illicit stories featuring office politics in naughty scenarios many of the stories focus around themes of power play and various types of discipline as one might expect all the stories are unique and written with their own brand of erotic fever from intellectual copulations to downright raunchy romps with a few added twists to add an element of surprise
3554301 open for business is worth the price of purchase just for the above mentioned erotica alone
3554302 there is one job we cant afford on the job training for our next president that could be the costliest job training in history
3554303 every day spent learning the ropes is another day of rising costs mounting deficits and growing anxiety for our families and they cannot afford to keep waiting
3554304 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
3554305 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
3554306 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts
3554307 a week without common sense political thought was making me feel lower than a snakes belly in a wagon rut
3554308 dana troglodyte misogynist obsessive a complete loser every time i pick on him no matter how nasty a person he is i feel bad because he is after all a loser
3554309 after several tests we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using yang peiyis voice
3554310 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first
3554311 the girl appearing on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expression and the great feeling she can give to people
3554312 3 entering first frame component is now visible to user
3554313 2 the component is drawing for the first time i sure hope it isnt visible yet
3554314 an application that is both visually stunning and beautifully functional
3554315 dont question us about paying for what we have after all weve got money even if we also have huge debts
3554316 this isnt just some roller coaster boom boom movie with batman
3554317 this isnt just some roller coaster boom boom movie with batman
3554318 why when this person asks you whether he the accused wanted them in the hospital or cemetery did you answer cemetery
3554319 its normal when food is involved that these eagles compete to get what they want they scavenge and steal food from other birds
3554320 sometimes parents dont like being near their young and in this case the desire for the food may not have been as great for the parent
3554321 youngsters are intimidating to their parents because they are dangerous with their equipment and these birds wont allow themselves to get hurt for anything
3554322 taking photos of these birds is how i got into photography but they have always been too far away and i couldnt get close enough until now
3554323 it was an amazing sight they made a screeching noise unlike anything ive heard before
3554324 yes there may be some impact on public hospitals but our estimate is that it is likely to be modest
3554325 not demonstrated that this case warrants the intervention of this court
3554326 no evil thats inflicted more pain and more suffering than racism and its something we in the labor movement have a special responsibility to challenge
3554327 then he just stood up on his hind legs and jumped on me
3554328 he was mad because he didnt get what he wanted he was going to make his stand
3554329 and the bear just came and pounced on him for no apparent reason
3554330 i dont know if you would call a bear like that a demented bear like some people or a super bear that decides hey i can take a person
3554331 a pure toss up state a mix of demographic issues booming population foreclosure crisis in the south moral issues of importance in the north collectivist unions that matter and libertarian feelings that matter this is a battleground state in the battleground west
3554332 president george w bush beat u s sen john kerry in 2004 in those three states new mexico colorado and nevada by a little more than 127 000 popular and 19 electoral votes or the same margin by which kerry lost that years presidential race
3554333 a racist take on a black new orleans crack dealing whore
3554334 zero jabbas uncle originally spoke in hutt ese like jabba and then he had a different sluggish voice just like jabba and then george one day was watching it and said i want him to sound like truman capote
3554335 its a hybrid of it but the inspiration is definitely there on capote its one of those things that takes him from being an interesting character and i think really does put him over the top and does something hes a favorite among the crew here
3554336 the chinese government has put in place a system to spy on and gather information about every guest at hotels where olympic visitors are staying
3554337 this means journalists athletes families and other visitors will be subjected to invasive intelligence gathering by the chinese public security bureau
3554338 in one case an organisation in the us working with some government agencies allowed me to get into their systems to see their servers named for their clients their servers were called cia fbi and dod
3554339 to be honest its sheer luck if a security officer spots something in an environment like that
3554340 considering the history of this site and the ongoing threat of terrorism it only makes sense that the n y p d devote significant resources to protect the world trade center
3554341 management of the security operations control center and oversight of security operations personnel and technologies including screening procedures and vehicular access
3554342 we have obtained information that international terrorist organisations would likely launch an attack against an olympic venue in the city during the games
3554343 we have staged raids and cracked a group of terrorists
3554344 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3554345 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3554346 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3554347 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3554348 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

3554351 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

3554353 i was always conscious that eating organic was better for the environment
3554354 but when i had kids it became more important to me that organic was good for my kids health especially since they are so much more vulnerable
3554355 when i worked for the company i was not allowed to bring my kids to the fields because of the spraying
3554356 many people have found organic foods to be cost prohibitive
3554357 o organics is priced so that people who have never considered organic foods will try them and realize that organic doesnt mean sacrificing quality or taste
3554358 when you look at the consumer surveys in general people see organic products as fitting in with their efforts to live a more healthful life
3554359 i actually feel kind of guilty that i never scrapped the whole train collection and tried to find an alternative
3554360 but it was hard to take them away from my four year old
3554361 california continues to lead the nation in protecting children from dangerous chemicals and in safeguarding our environment amp ab 1108 sends a clear message to the consumer product safety commission that if the bush administration wont act states will
3554362 cpsc is now half the size it was in 1980 and george bush has taken away funding
3554363 i wouldnt say that one is definitely better than the other
3554364 speaking for myself i think it is great to reuse whenever you can
3554365 a lot of information out there about potty training is all or nothing
3554366 you have to put your kid in underwear and deal with accidents for me it was about making it easier a lot of people say i cant do this because i am a working mother if you have five extra minutes to take your infant and sit her on the potty and have that bonding time then youre on your way to teaching your kid to be aware of the fact that the toilet is where they need to eliminate
3554367 the love of the earth is something that comes very naturally to them its not a hard thing to teach
3554368 when they see me buy a plastic bottle of water they call me on it
3554369 right now there is an unregulated marketplace where companies can make whatever claims they want
3554370 one popular us therapist hulda clark in her books the cure for all diseases and the cure for all cancers says that all illness is caused by either pollutants or parasites or you could put it another way the orthodox doctor treats what you have and the alternative practitioner says you have what she treats
3554371 proof according to the mayo clinic the scientific evidence supports the claim that st johns wort can combat mild to moderate depression
3554372 page wanted to lose weight and claims that she was advised by nash to drink four pints of water a day and to cut out salt from her diet nash denies any fault and although she paid page a settlement of pounds 810 000 last week she did so without admission of liability
3554373 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3554374 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3554375 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3554376 in fact on election night he is glued to the computer surfing news sites for up to the minute results he wouldnt go to bed until we found out who won
3554377 he has the leadership skills to move the country in the right direction

3554383 jamtse love and compassion an offering to the tibet fund
3554384 it was a blessing to have this opportunity to bring together music from diverse cultures and traditions in support of the tibetan people

3554404 we the people in order to form a more perfect union
3554405 people began to shout to rise from their seats and clap and cry out a forceful wind carrying the reverends voice up into the rafters and in that single note hope i heard something else at the foot of that cross inside the thousands of churches across the city i imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of david and goliath moses and pharaoh the christians in the lions den ezekiels field of dry bones those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our story my story the blood that had spilled was our blood the tears our tears until this black church on this bright day seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal black and more than black in chronicling our journey the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didnt need to feel shame about memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start to rebuild
3554406 the past isnt dead and buried in fact it isnt even past
3554407 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

3554411 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3554412 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3554413 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3554414 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3554415 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3554416 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3554417 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3554418 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3554419 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3554420 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3554421 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3554422 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3554423 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3554424 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3554425 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3554426 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3554427 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3554428 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3554429 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3554430 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3554431 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3554432 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3554433 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3554434 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3554435 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3554436 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3554437 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3554438 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos

3554450 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

3554454 gravity waves as predicted by einstein are one of the strangest phenomena in nature they are a traveling stretching and squashing of space and time if they exist they will be passing through you right now as you read this speeding up and slowing down your watch and stretching and squashing your head fortunately by an amount less than the size of a sub atomic particle einsteins laws must break down in the hearts of black holes so you dont feel them but remarkably ligo may see their effects the observation of gravity waves would be another remarkable triumph for einstein but even that will not satisfy physicists like myself this is because we know that there are places in the universe where einstein must fail in the heart of black holes giant suns collapsed to a single infinitely dense point einstein breaks down and even more crucially back at the beginning of time the big bang itself einsteins picture of space and time is no longer adequate we physicists are therefore faced with a deep problem if we want to truly understand how and maybe even why the universe began then we must know what space and time looked like right back at the beginning such a theory if it exists would be what is known as a quantum theory of gravity a theory that supersedes einstein and works not only in the world of planets stars and galaxies but also in the sub atomic sized world of black holes and the very beginning of the universe itself this quest is the holy grail of 21st century physics

3554461 garages need to contribute to their neighborhood and respond to their context but that doesnt mean faking it by pretending theyre something else

3554467 most cities in northern california dont want to see a parking garage as a parking garage they want it to look like some other kind of building

3554469 when i see the ones that are really detrimental to their setting its because theyre trying to be something theyre not
3554470 the challenge of parking structures is that they arent generally what we think of in a typical building

3554484 to his credit hes continued to hustle and hes played really well in right field hes just in a little bit of a slump probably trying to do too much
3554485 he needs just to do the things that hes capable of like he was earlier in the year hes taking less pitches hes not working the count the way he was earlier he just needs to swing at more strikes

3554491 probably left also but hes used to the right side if we moved cordy to a right tackle we could move kiante tripp over to left tackle i would say that would exhaust the possibilities
3554492 i think just watching cordy it didnt take long at all to say he can do it physically this year
3554493 the question is how quickly can he learn hes been running with the no 1 unit for a few days now at guard
3554494 to know the backside of your qb is protected and to know that he understands what to do is critical
3554495 hes just bigger stronger and more experienced than he was a year ago and he did a pretty good job a year ago its sad for him of course because he worked so hard he got up to the 310 pound range and was as strong as hes ever been was practicing so well its hard to lose experience

3554693 this injustice of the world inspires a rage so intense that to express it fully would require homicidal action its self destructive destroy the world rage simply put ive learned that i must find a way to channel that anger to the positive and the highest positive is forgiveness
3554694 the measure of a man is how he cares for his children
3554695 so what we do is we stay within the context of whats practical whats real what dreams can be fashioned into reality what values can send us to bed comfortably and make us courageous enough to face our end with character thats what were seeking thats what its all about you know were all of us a little greedy some of us are plenty greedy were all somewhat courageous and were all considerably cowardly were all imperfect and life is simply a perpetual unending struggle against those imperfections

3554704 the united states has finally ended the practice of mandating discrimination against hiv positive people by removing the statutory ban on entry for hiv positive foreign nationals congress has sent a clear signal that we cant fight discrimination and stigma abroad until we end them at home congress has done its part now its time for hhs to act
3554705 with the statutory ban no longer in place we can now begin to frame a fair and sensible hiv immigration policy
3554706 the department of health and human services should act swiftly to remove hiv from its list it is time to leave behind this vestige of the fear and ignorance about aids that gripped the united states in the late 1980s today everyone knows that you cant get aids from sitting next to someone on an airplane or sharing a bathroom american policy should reflect this
3554707 today president bush signed the pepfar reauthorization bill into law not only does this represent a profound commitment to fighting the aids epidemic globally but it also finally eliminates the discriminatory travel and immigration ban on individuals with hiv i am proud to have sponsored this initiative and to have worked with so many superb organizations like immigration equality on its passage

3554709 are sending a signal that gay people are not welcome in south carolina
3554710 but we agree with sen thomas about using tax money to promote any group with a particular social or political agenda
3554711 south carolina is so gay explore an america most never see from plantations to the civil war golf to gay beaches
3554712 our tourism marketing funds are for the purpose of bringing visitors to south carolina not for getting involved in various social agendas
3554713 south carolinians dont care for their tax money to be invested in ways that they dont think is consistent with their values and i think promoting gay tourism is inconsistent with south carolina values
3554714 weve gone to other resorts in the south and you stick out like a sore thumb

3554716 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3554717 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom

3554719 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3554720 we are not staying home with our children by default

3554730 unless it worsens the georgia russia conflict is having comparatively little impact compared to what it wouldve done had it happened in june
3554731 the fact that oil didnt go up immediately was partly a reflection of market sentiment and partly a reflection that the big pipeline had already been out of action before the hostilities started

3554742 small businesses that are going to be liable for a lot of income tax are likely to use other tax forms so they only pay individual income taxes
3554743 the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes
3554744 the u s corporate tax rate stayed the same while foreign countries have drifted down which increases the incentive for companies to report income in other countries
3554745 if the u s drops the rate to 30 but closes other tax loopholes that may ultimately generate more tax revenue for the government

3554764 i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones
3554765 war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse the person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight nothing which is more important than his own personal safety is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself
3554766 it is well that war is so terrible otherwise we would grow too fond of it
3554767 i must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy my sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy geography natural history naval architecture navigation commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting poetry music architecture statuary tapestry and porcelain

3554770 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3554771 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3554772 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3554773 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3554774 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3554775 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3554776 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3554777 potential candidates who receive the suggestion to run for office are more than four times as likely as those who receive no such support to think seriously about a candidacy
3554778 its easy to become immune to stories about student debt but this increase is not just another rise some students are facing real financial hardship
3554779 even so the advantages of having a degree still outweigh the costs and the push survey shows that with high quality advice and information students can keep their debts while still enjoying the benefits of university
3554780 it is clear that many students are sleepwalking into financial crisis
3554781 as the credit crunch kicks in and with food and fuel costs set to rise even further we can expect more and more students to get into serious financial difficulty with many having to resort to taking out commercial loans or being bailed out by their parents
3554782 our research shows that prospective students need far more information advice and guidance about how to manage their own finances
3554783 when they leave home for the first time many students are unaware of the costs of everyday life and how debt can mount up
3554784 government universities schools and colleges all those involved must continue to ensure that all those who can benefit from going to university are not deterred from doing so by the prospect of debt

3554789 esto llama la atenci n porque pens bamos que este tipo de temas estaba bajo control pero no es as en el mbito de la informaci n de gesti n hay mucho trabajo por hacer para poder anticipar este tipo de s ntomas porque nadie se dio cuenta
3554790 esto es importante ya que al final se debe invertir en sistemas de informaci n pero nos damos cuenta que ante las p rdidas que se han enfrentado cualquier inversi n en sistemas hubiera dado un retorno muy positivo hubiera servido para evitar una parte significativa de estas p rdidas

3554819 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3554820 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3554821 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3554822 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3554823 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3554824 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3554825 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3554958 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3554959 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3554960 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3554961 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3554962 the democrats have nominated a man who is a mere fad or meme win or lose they will have a horrible case of buyers remorse
3554963 what happens is theres an internal impingement going on when i get my arm up and accelerate through the slot
3554964 you keep repeating that a hundred some times its eventually going to want to shut down im trying to grit my teeth now and get through it but i think they made the right decision on nipping it in the bud now so hopefully i can be healthy in september down the stretch

3554994 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3554995 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3554996 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3554997 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3554998 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3554999 we made the decision that the voice we would use was yang peiyis the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3555000 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in the aspect of voice yang peiyi is flawless
3555001 we had been through several inspections they were all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were spectators from various divisions especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion it must change
3555002 i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi that is to say we have a perfect voice and a perfect image and representation in our teams view combined together
3555003 adults may lie but leave the kids out of it

3555024 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3555025 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3555037 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3555038 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3555042 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3555043 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3555051 we are going to take it out of the hides of wall street
3555052 we want the abolition of the national banks and we want the power to make loans direct from the government
3555053 we want the accursed foreclosure system wiped out we will stand by our homes and stay by our firesides by force if necessary and we will not pay our debts to the loan shark companies until the government pays its debts to us
3555054 wall street is our bad example because it is so successful
3555055 provides us with new origination capabilities in the non prime market which we can build upon to provide access to high quality product flows across all market cycles
3555056 we were thinking that we could just tape it up and itd be better
3555057 this was the better thing to do just get it healed up now so we dont have to worry about it later
3555058 the coaches didnt want it to keep getting re injured and bother me the entire season
3555059 when you have an all american tight end who gets hurt it gives other people a chance
3555060 they got thrown in against the first team in a tough environment and made some plays
3555061 at the beginning i was kind of nervous out there
3555062 ive been running with the top groups in practice so i shouldnt have been so shaky
3555063 the guys who didnt commit until really late i just tried to help out the coaches and bring better players around the program
3555064 id give them calls and talk to them on the internet about coming to mizzou
3555065 i thought chase patton did a really good job going against the ones
3555066 as we sit here today the question isnt whether or not we are going to all agree on one program the real issue is whether we are going to try
3555067 americans across the country who are facing record gas prices are calling on congress to create a comprehensive plan that moves us in the direction of energy independence we cannot do that by taking a five week august recess that is why weve continued to gather on the house floor to urge leadership to return so we can work together to bring a comprehensive bipartisan energy plan to the floor for a vote
3555068 petition are associated with virginia congressman eric cantor eric odom founder of dontgo has asked americans to come to washington dc to voice their grievances regarding the inability of congress to address the energy issue
3555069 since congress is at home for recess we figure that there should be some angry americans waiting for them when they finally come back to congress
3555070 what wed like and what were urging americans nationwide to do is to speak their minds and if theyre as mad as the polls indicate about congress inability to address the energy crisis then americans ought to let their representatives know about it by marching on washington to petition their government
3555071 in law enforcement we say you lie you fly if your word is no good theres no need for you as an officer
3555072 theyre going to face the consequences of possibly never being able to testify again in a criminal matter
3555073 they had him in a position of disadvantage on the ground for handcuffing so there would have been absolutely no justification for that use of force
3555074 that use of force would have been vicious and vindictive
3555075 officers face difficult tasks every day and they have to be above petty animosities and anger
3555076 if thats why this individual was injured thats utterly inexcusable
3555077 youre dealing with some vulnerable areas youre dealing with all of the orbital fractures that could occur youve got nose fractures youve got all the mouth and teeth injuries and as a consequence youre doing to induce serious injury to that person
3555078 youre going to have to have justification to use that force
3555079 displaying an act of courage that clearly distinguishes gallantry beyond the call of duty
3555080 we have asked all parties to act as quickly as possible so that we may fully understand the facts of this situation and move forward as those facts warrant
3555081 the use of force policy by design and necessity is fairly general it has to be because its impossible to identify all of the circumstances that would happen on the street
3555082 an officer shall use only that degree of force necessary and reasonable under the circumstances
3555083 we have a particularly aggressive growth plan in a nascent and rapidly growing market
3555084 a major part of this plan includes investing in response to the growing market demand for carbon management services and strengthening our ability to access and support customers we are very happy to have raised a significant portion of our financing with a leader in cleantech investments like ngen partners
3555085 with todays announcement were combining the two key ingredients that are necessary to bring solar power to scale access to capital and the expertise to put it to use
3555086 were excited to work with hudson and its team of clean energy experts it was clear from day one that we share a common vision of what it takes to be successful in the downstream solar market
3555087 the main factors in our decision to partner with recurrent energy were the quality of its management team and their vision for how to scale the business both of which will enable the company to produce a major leap forward in the adoption of onsite solar electricity
3555088 we anticipate that this is just the beginning of an even larger financing relationship and we are committed to providing recurrent energy with the resources it will need to be a powerhouse in solar energy
3555089 were excited that the tremendous demand that weve received from the thousands of individuals who have pre ordered their aptera typ 1 has been matched with a strong endorsement from our investment partners
3555090 the vehicle is exciting the timing seems perfect and the market is eager to buy one of these first built units these new funds will be instrumental as we pursue our goal of bringing the typ 1 to market later this year
3555091 with energy prices and oil prices where they are we feel dramatic increases in the efficiency of transportation like the typ 1 are greatly needed
3555092 the aptera typ 1 is designed to be the lowest energy way to transport two passengers safely from point a to point b clearly our expectations for this first vehicle and this company are very high
3555093 here at corporate express we see sustainability as a partnership with our customers and we take many steps with them to help reduce environmental impact such as offering free toner and inkjet recycling annual catalog recycling and eco preferable shopping online
3555094 now were launching this contest to invite businesses across the u s to tell their sustainability story as a fun and creative way to encourage sustainability in the workplace
3555095 purchasing eco preferable products is just one of the many steps that businesses can take toward greater workplace sustainability
3555096 through this contest we want to help raise awareness with businesses about the breadth of eco conscious products that are available for the office
3555097 we are actively working to reduce the cost of solar systems to make solar energy competitive with conventional electric power
3555098 were delighted to have the support of this top tier group of investors to help us accomplish this goal their experience and track records give us additional confidence that we will achieve our commercial market objectives

3555129 we are absolutely vigorously committed to the successful prosecution of the multilateral trade liberalisation round through doha
3555130 we are a member of the g7 group of negotiating countries led by trade minister simon crean and we havent given up yet
3555131 in fact its been a feature of my discussions elsewhere in the region including with the chinese about how we can still close the gap between the final negotiating positions reached in geneva only a week or two ago
3555132 multilateral trade liberalisation is the best for the world because the rules then dont discriminate against any country and thats the best way to enhance global economic growth
3555133 the howard government has had this consistent policy of saying bilateral free trade agreements are fine and if we manage to get a multilateral free trade agreement through the doha round that would be ok as well the australian government under john howard over many years has led to the incremental whittling away of the global importance of the multilateral trade rounds successful conclusion because they have led the charge globally in the negotiations of bilateral ftas

3555139 quite frankly the epa is between individual member states and the eu it is not caricom and the eu it is the cariforum countries in their individual capacities
3555140 what we would really hope is that everybody will be on board
3555141 it united position doesnt always work there are issues that have been raised not only by guyana and grenada but by individuals in the caribbean who are passionate about the caribbean and its future
3555142 they have raised some issues and they feel the caribbean countries ought not to sign because we havent had enough out of the deal that is a question of judgement it is a question of opinion the question is to have to weight the advantages against the disadvantages
3555143 do we put ourselves in a better position if we just say look we are not signing there are certain implications for that
3555144 the opportunity presents itself even at the point of which we decide to sign to be able to continue the process of dialogue that will allow for adjustments and revisions to be made
3555145 everything doesnt kick in immediately there is a transitional period so the opportunity does present itself it is a difficult situation difficult for all of us we would have liked to be perhaps in a better position
3555146 they were able to formulate a package which was felt under the circumstances would have been the best that we could have got the question is should we walk away from that and say listen we are not bothering we are going to continue the negotiations now that has some implications
3555147 it is not an easy issue it presents some real challenges for us and we are seeking to look at the option which says okay if you weigh the whole thing if you refuse to sign what is the implication as against you signing in other words you are in there and you are now in a position to negotiate if you want to call it that to look at those troubling areas that you would wish to see some adjustments made and the mechanisms in my view within the epa allows for that to take place
3555148 we were prepared to sit down and listen to the garbage coming out of europe about free trade without really examining what they were doing
3555149 we are seeking to make some representation at the level of president of the european union
3555150 we are not just sitting back and saying well listen come september 2 we just have to sign come what may what we are saying we are making certain manoeuvres in the meantime to see what can be done to create an environment in which we know that even if we sign in september we have an opportunity to revisit re adjust certain situations that are of concern to us

3555153 for me i dont know if this is the right thing to say but hes yet to play in an nba practice hes yet to play in an nba game so i think the expectations are more on him personally than it is on everybody else
3555154 we know how good he can be but he is still a rookie
3555155 he favors dunking on your head thats what he favors
3555156 i think a lot of people forgot how good we could have been last year

3555159 if we can start breaking those 4 or 5 or 6 yard runs its gonna bring that safety down and then were one on one on the outside
3555160 right now i feel like marvin harrison and reggie wayne are the standard bearers
3555161 i would love to put us up there but youve also got t j houshmandzadeh and chad johnson in the mix with the cincinnati bengals
3555162 as for us we need to prove ourselves as a duo but we do pose a threat on paper so well see
3555163 we agree with you that promoting universal broadband is an urgent national priority
3555164 however we are concerned that incumbent wireless carriers are seeking unnecessary and unprecedented testing delays to prevent new innovative competitors from entering the market

3555176 school time expeditions especially the dangerous ones that pose a high risk of being caned has always encroached the pivotal chambers in our hearts and the pirates of ashok nagar are no exception we yearn the precious time we had wasted in boring essays instead we could have had a quick run to the cavernous toilet or a healthy verbal tussle about the recent film releases of the week
3555177 do you see something here this isnt the first time i am forced into something
3555178 all i want from my sons is a little concern and it couldnt be clearer can it
3555179 every distinguished guest is well learned and experienced in their own fields
3555180 nice try but it wouldnt work i will stand beside you like a pillar and thats all i was surprised to see the slight edge in my voice my mother looked affronted and didnt speak at all for the rest of the journey
3555181 theres this girl ragini sree who appeared in jaya tv she is coming today to sing a few songs great isnt it
3555182 when is she coming i mean the time of her arrival are you sure she is coming how come mr pvn got to know her he must have pulled a hundred strings to get her
3555183 abdul kalam studied in your college you know it was a very prestigious institution in those times but i hardly hear about it nowadays maybe its students have other things in their minds right now
3555184 i am going for a walk around the house dont search for me give a missed call when everything is over
3555185 she will think twice before accepting a party thrown by pvn
3555186 this evening will add to my list of the most boring evenings
3555187 yeah it sure will why dont you add all the evenings to that list
3555188 dont say that ive had some evenings when time seemed to fly you know
3555189 yeah i agree but what happened to you i should say you have changed you were very happy go lucky those days things seemed to happen the right way a few years ago but now you brood over things most of the time like now you become resentful and pessimistic most of the time any new opportunity goes amiss if it comes to you you have moved away from most of your friends yet you blame them deep in your heart for deserting you you simply seemed to spellbind girls whenever they talk a few words with you but now you stare at them till they shy away like chickens or you gibber something incoherent that makes them to walk away muttering about time wasters my talk will be insincere if i say you were a child prodigy in school but it is absolutely true to say that you were reasonably talented quite engaging student for any teacher you didnt bag the topper award every year but you were well known throughout the school either for your witty remarks or your boyish appearance and needless to say is your impish carefree grin that captivated an appreciable number of girls you viewed yourself as an enterprising and talented boy offers and suggestions fly at you from all directions but you took your own way of doing things which lead to nothing but victory you solved innumerous problems those days be it math of logic but now you become flustered whenever you approach a problem making calculation errors that make ten year old midgets to leer at you you have entered into m i t which isnt a walk in the park but you have failed to appreciate your achievements and now your exam performances are abysmal and not to mention is that inevitable arrear that youre dreading to materialize any moment for you speaking english came as fluent as a swooshing waterfall but now you stutter and splutter for words in short you have become a nobody in three years why what went wrong
3555190 youre the same person you need to re invent yourself all over again it is not an easy process but nowhere close to impossible the mantra may sound so simple but unimaginably powerful it is
3555191 what is it i asked i intended to sound bothered but it sounded passionate almost eager she didnt seem perturbed by my bad manners if the truth is to be told she turned inquisitive
3555192 i saw you talking to your reflection in that pond
3555193 ask her what she is doing here instead of singing for the people at the manor be cool and show genuine interest in your voice but dont overdo it and the most important thing is to be yourself for the real you is more likeable than anything else dont worry she wont leave you now
3555194 i said my voice sounded a little hoarse but cool
3555195 well i sang a few songs but those idiots hardly listened to me they were busy making business deals or gossiping about some crap and they tried to involve me in it i couldnt stand it any longer
3555196 i just wish this day will end and i will never accept to sing in parties like this
3555197 yeah they a bunch of snobs and thats why i came here i just wanted to be left alone
3555198 call me bharani and i am studying third year in college and you rocked in that show in tv brilliant
3555199 you are a great singer thats why pvn has called you
3555200 oh not that my father worked under pvn a few years ago thats why
3555201 my mother worked under pvn too what is your fathers name i asked i had a pang that the conversation was veering off course but anything can happen in this evening i thought for the recent happenings had forcibly reminded of harry potter where the spiders talk and dragons fly
3555202 his name is mani and by any chance is your house in sixth avenue ashok nagar
3555203 that was my previous neighbourhood and how did you know that
3555204 oh my god i remember now my father took us to your home when i was this small
3555205 you pulled my hair and made me cry didnt you
3555206 yeah and i had a nagging feeling from the beginning and you havent changed much
3555207 she should be interested in something movies books concerts it could be anything grab a topic you know the most but be modest dont start pirouetting about the books you have read start with a low profile i have a hunch that she likes harry potter
3555208 well i read a lot of books and i am a harry potter freak
3555209 oh thats great then answer this question did you think harry should die in the last part
3555210 if truth is to be told i thought harry should have died in the last part it would have been a logical ending
3555211 that is not sensible harry is extremely talented too he grabbed the gryffindor sword when he was twelve defied voldemort a lot of times and he could ward off dementors in his third year j k rowling has given enough credentials to harry as she has given to voldemort
3555212 that is right retort with more ferocity but not without your touch of gallantry and dont forget to be sensible or else you will make little difference to mr pipe
3555213 good god i didnt know you were this passionate about harry potter but perspectives do differ if youre intolerant to my views then what is the point in having a discussion harry potter wouldnt fall in love with you just because you thought he would survive
3555214 are you listening to me or not give me your mobile number if you have one
3555215 what do expect from a person who had been subjected to such a torture

3555219 were just proceeding forward as though he governor will sign it when the time comes
3555220 he governor will continue to work with the legislature on that after we have a budget
3555221 but until we have a budget as the governor said were not going to sign any bills
3555222 i think theres reason for some optimism but im also a lifelong chicago cubs fan
3555223 this additional data sale to an existing customer is testament to intermaps ability to collect and deliver high quality data to our customers providing high value on time results
3555224 the cash generated from our contract services business helps fund our ongoing investment in the nextmap database which continues to rapidly grow through record data collection levels in 2008
3555225 we initially tried to eliminate these errors manually using spreadsheets
3555226 it was soon apparent that this was unworkable especially when we published the data on our website for feedback from residents we reviewed a number of gazetteer management solutions and ggp ngz was simply the best product for our needs
3555227 ggp ngz is easy to use for the ongoing maintenance of the gazetteer and possibly of greater importance easy to integrate with other systems and services
3555228 this supports a wide range of council business functions and underpins improved processes customer services and operational efficiencies
3555229 not only is it a labor of love but as society forges ahead into a techo embedded era the tactile now is more important than ever people like to touch things

3555232 the response from oems system integrators game developers press and most importantly from gamers has been incredibly positive
3555233 the new products join a line up of stellar offerings all of which are designed to give gamers experiences that approach eye definition computing
3555234 we have not seen anything of this scale in a long time
3555235 when you come in at 500 600 miles per hour drop a 500 pound bomb and then fly away you dont see what happens
3555236 you watch it all the way to impact and i mean its very vivid its right there and personal so it does stay in peoples minds for a long time
3555237 we set our price where we think it was fair given all considerations of the various issues
3555238 no evil thats inflicted more pain and more suffering than racism and its something we in the labor movement have a special responsibility to challenge
3555239 yeah just cuz its the theme song dont make it not true
3555240 blackface is a style of theatrical makeup that originated in the united states used to affect the countenance of an iconic racist american archetype that of the darky or coon
3555241 when all is said and done we wouldnt be surprised to see very little global oil demand growth over this year and next
3555242 even if retail prices ease it seems unlikely that motorists who have purchased smaller cars will revert to gas guzzling vehicles
3555243 nevertheless the transition to a more fuel efficient u s fleet will take some time
3555244 in a couple of years time when things settle down well point back and say that was the peak and well all be trying to analyze when we get back to that peak again which i think we will
3555245 riggle also had the somewhat unexpected experience of being recognized on the street twice one young asian couple came up and said how much they enjoyed watching him on stewarts show leading him to wonder where they had seen it

3555251 maybe if you ask me in a week i could tell you everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing
3555252 probably left also but hes used to the right side if we moved cordy to a right tackle we could move kiante tripp over to left tackle i would say that would exhaust the possibilities
3555253 i think just watching cordy it didnt take long at all to say he can do it physically this year
3555254 the question is how quickly can he learn hes been running with the no 1 unit for a few days now at guard
3555255 to know the backside of your qb is protected and to know that he understands what to do is critical
3555256 hes just bigger stronger and more experienced than he was a year ago and he did a pretty good job a year ago its sad for him of course because he worked so hard he got up to the 310 pound range and was as strong as hes ever been was practicing so well its hard to lose experience
3555257 maybe if you ask me in a week i could tell you everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing
3555258 probably left also but hes used to the right side if we moved cordy to a right tackle we could move kiante tripp over to left tackle i would say that would exhaust the possibilities
3555259 i think just watching cordy it didnt take long at all to say he can do it physically this year
3555260 the question is how quickly can he learn hes been running with the no 1 unit for a few days now at guard
3555261 to know the backside of your qb is protected and to know that he understands what to do is critical
3555262 hes just bigger stronger and more experienced than he was a year ago and he did a pretty good job a year ago its sad for him of course because he worked so hard he got up to the 310 pound range and was as strong as hes ever been was practicing so well its hard to lose experience

3555265 five years ago president bush challenged americas innovators to develop new hydrogen technologies to help reduce our nations dependence on oil and today we have a fleet of hydrogen vehicles making their way across the country
3555266 these hydrogen vehicles are the non polluting cars of tomorrow and they are being demonstrated today on our nations roads
3555267 hydrogen is part of a balanced and diverse energy portfolio that will help address our future energy environmental and economic security needs
3555268 this tour provides americans an opportunity to see what the future could hold for hydrogen powered vehicles as we work to help make these vehicles cost competitive and available for all
3555269 could actually get up to maybe 50 miles per gallon by 2030
3555270 nhtsa is on a path already to go way beyond 35 mpg by 2020
3555271 its going to go much much higher than that its going to be much more dramatic than we thought this is going to drive a lot of innovation and were not going to have a choice
3555272 im going to get them into the lineup whether its for fukudome or anybody else
3555273 they need to play too theyve done a nice job here
3555274 were pulling for him ive never said i was disappointed all ive said basically was that wed like to see him start hitting and it created a stir
3555275 to his credit hes continued to hustle and hes played really well in right field hes just in a little bit of a slump probably trying to do too much
3555276 he needs just to do the things that hes capable of like he was earlier in the year hes taking less pitches hes not working the count the way he was earlier he just needs to swing at more strikes
3555277 you try to find somebody else thats swinging the bat
3555278 it created a stir and if thats the case im sorry
3555279 this recipe can also be used as a marinade and is great on all proteins including chicken duck and shrimp
3555280 my favorite is over grilled pork chops with some sweet potatoes on the side delicious

3555284 billys a cool guy and we loved hanging out with him
3555285 hed make fun of his thick bronx accent even called him a drama queen for some reason
3555286 we all had a lot of good times before and were looking forward to hanging out with billy and his band on the tour we also cant wait to see all of the familiar faces we saw the last time we passed through on the thrashing like a maniac tour i hope that those guys told their friends and that we see many more new faces along the way
3555287 after long and careful quest quebec based technical death metal band brief respite has hired peru born and quebec resident roxana bouchard for the lead singing spot
3555288 hey everyone nuno bettencourt guitar and gary cherone vocals here we just wanted to check in and let you know that it feels great to be on the road again and so far its been an amazing turnout of our loyal fans and also some new faces you guys have been incredible and have made our return worthwhile so we thank you from the bottom of our hearts we have missed you and we will always give you all we got on that stage and we have yet to visit many of you throughout the next five months around the globe and looking forward to the shows and getting reacquainted with you so get ready to funk it up we will celebrate and oh btw our new record came out today its a 3 course meal so digest it but be careful swallowing its kinda spicy
3555289 after our mucho praised main stage show at the bloodstock festival in 2006 were delighted to announce that well be at catton hall for bloodstock 2008 we made some great friends at the 2006 show and we hope to see ya again this year well be headlining the thursday night show taking place on the lava stage and will be previewing for the first time some tracks from the new album razorhead ahead of the album launch in october on dr2 records
3555290 if this scenario had happened nine months ago he wouldnt have been captured or he would have asked for help and they would have let him go
3555291 thats a clear indication of the change of attitude taking place among tijuana police
3555292 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3555293 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3555294 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3555295 maybe if you ask me in a week i could tell you everything is going to be ok but right now im still kind of sick about the whole thing
3555296 probably left also but hes used to the right side if we moved cordy to a right tackle we could move kiante tripp over to left tackle i would say that would exhaust the possibilities
3555297 i think just watching cordy it didnt take long at all to say he can do it physically this year
3555298 the question is how quickly can he learn hes been running with the no 1 unit for a few days now at guard
3555299 to know the backside of your qb is protected and to know that he understands what to do is critical
3555300 hes just bigger stronger and more experienced than he was a year ago and he did a pretty good job a year ago its sad for him of course because he worked so hard he got up to the 310 pound range and was as strong as hes ever been was practicing so well its hard to lose experience
3555301 our vision is big but it makes sense we want to see 34 stations by 2020
3555302 we could become the absolute world leader at about number eight and that would be a wonderful place to be at this is a real solution with serious players and proven technology
3555303 subject to conditions remaining favourable we expect to achieve increased earnings in 2009
3555304 we didnt know when it would work and were quite surprised at how well it will work
3555305 we found that the oil and gas blocks overlap perfectly with the most biodiverse part of the amazon for birds mammals and amphibians
3555306 the threat to amphibians is of particular concern because they are already the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide
3555307 the most dynamic situation is unfolding in the peruvian amazon
3555308 the elimination of new oil access roads could significantly reduce the impacts of most projects
3555309 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3555310 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognize that indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3555311 filling up with a tank of gas could soon have devastating consequences to rainforests their peoples and their species
3555312 we want to make it so that if you are injured in tucson you dont have to go anywhere else ever
3555313 the vast majority of the public have no idea we do a wide variety of things
3555314 we do everything from putting our fingers on the bleeding hole to injury prevention coordinating care alcohol and drug intervention programs research on drugs to help stop bleeding
3555315 we have the right number of people to help us put the finger on the hole adequately next we need to get to the number to help the community
3555316 when i heard that my dancing for five minutes while wearing a jeans and t shirt in the prom party caused such offence i was shocked
3555317 sometimes i feel i get used to these things but i dont because they never cease to amaze me
3555318 i couldnt believe i could be responsible for unleashing a sexual uprising by hundreds of men its just unbelievable
3555319 i see no hope or future for belly dancing in egypt
3555320 ten years ago we were so many each one had her own style and audience whether first class belly dancers or second and third class now i look around and see nobody
3555321 i think the problem some have with belly dancing here is the dancing costume but it has always been seductive like this we our generation didnt invent it like ballet can the ballerina dance with a different outfit we too cant dance with our bodies covered
3555322 if i had a daughter i would advise her not to become a belly dancer
3555323 i surround myself with people who love dancing and who are very understanding so i dont get the feeling that im doing something wrong at all
3555324 but when these problems happen from time to time its a reminder that many people look down on dancing and that its seen as shameful
3555325 most of the brides are veiled but they dont stop dancing with me and their groom all night long for egyptians who can afford it a wedding means a belly dancer
3555326 of course i would never imagine myself being a belly dancer
3555327 but i had dina at my wedding that was a dream come true
3555328 at my wedding i slaughtered sheep and distributed to the poor by the same amount of money that i would have paid to a belly dancer
3555329 i think god would bless a marriage that begins by feeding the poor not wasting money on belly dancers
3555330 belly dancing is in our blood its deeply rooted in our soil
3555331 i think this really is a pretty clear indication rather than it being climate change causing the rapid extinction of the tasmanian mega fauna which was the current orthodoxy
3555332 our message to speaker pelosi is very simple we are ready to vote on more energy production and lower gas prices right now and we should not wait one more day to begin giving the american people the relief they expect and deserve
3555333 if you meant what you said last night we welcome you and your democratic colleagues to join us in our historic call to action on american energy
3555334 we know that wind energy can and must play a critical role in securing our future needs
3555335 but our review of wind energy in the country finds that there is an urgent need to reassess the current policies and incentives so that the business of wind gets serious about generating power and not just installing wind farms and reaping benefits from fiscal incentives
3555336 in the current scheme which gives an accelerated depreciation benefit of 80 per cent and other tax incentives for installation of the plants wind energy has become the business of cash rich investors who take advantage of tax benefits and are not serious about generation of power
3555337 the current business is not geared to generation of power and increasing efficiencies and reducing costs this is clearly not good if we want wind energy to play an important role in our future energy security
3555338 the indian wind energy sector needs to be re energised and for that to happen policy needs to change and get real
3555339 too little too inadequate and too hesitant to change the business as it operates currently
3555340 a higher race subjects to itself a lower race a right which we see in nature and which can be regarded as the sole conceivable right
3555341 this is what we battle with on a daily basis spam could literally just kill this thing
3555342 its not getting any better and its probably getting worse
3555343 spam blogs and their cousins spings continue to present infrastructure providers like technorati a challenge
3555344 aside from a few notable spam storms the high level of interesting original content being created greatly outweighs the fake or duplicate content listed on splogs
3555345 the japanese market is so tightly closed that its hard to assure the sale of 500 units this year
3555346 but for japanese parts our major export items like mobile phones memory semiconductors shipbuilding and vessels would be half finished
3555347 es imperiosa la necesidad de que podamos dialogar y discutir los compromisos contra dos por la naci n
3555348 a los efectos de solicitarle formal y p blicamente con car cter de urgente una audiencia de trabajo a fin de tratar temas de inter s com n especialmente los relacionados con la caja de jubilaciones de c rdoba
3555349 no me imagino que sea la justicia quien tenga que dictaminar sobre este tema sin previamente haber hecho todos los esfuerzos por escucharnos tanto usted como presidenta de todos los argentinos como yo en tanto gobernador de todos los cordobeses
3555350 tengo una muy buena relaci n con el gobierno provincial y esto no puede seguir as
3555351 los reiterados desplantes y humillaciones cotidianas que recibe el gobierno de c rdoba esconder an la intenci n del poder ejecutivo de intervenir la provincia que hasta ahora el matrimonio kirchner no ha podido doblegar
3555352 es inentendible c mo todav a no se ha concretado el encuentro entre massa y schiaretti a n cuando el funcionario nacional ha mantenido reuniones con diferentes gobernadores y ha recibido a numerosos intendentes cordobeses dejando de lado al gobernador
3555353 lo que el gobierno nacional no puede hacer es tener a c rdoba de reh n
3555354 la naci n debe aclarar las cuentas con c rdoba y si tiene deuda que estoy seguro que la tiene que gire el dinero
3555355 no tire m s le a al fuego con sus declaraciones
3555356 estamos dispuestos a movilizarnos en las calles si es necesario
3555357 cerrando un comprimido resumen de su vida entr en el dialogo y le comento que

3555360 a higher race subjects to itself a lower race a right which we see in nature and which can be regarded as the sole conceivable right

3555364 although the declines in notices of defaults seem promising much of this can be explained by the actions of just one lender

3555403 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken
3555404 somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
3555405 their private investigators will be pursuing this line as an absolute priority to establish if it has been fully investigated and properly ruled out
3555406 they have got some of the information already from their lawyers and investigators and they are waiting to hear from them what is legitimate what is promising and what is not
3555407 they are frustrated by the delays and the mistakes that were made they have learned an awful lot about this kind of thing and god forbid she has fallen foul of any of these types
3555408 trafficking into belgium forms a very strong part of their investigation as does trafficking into north africa
3555409 there is definitive hard evidence that this is very much alive and happening and they have looked into the fact that someone was targeting children and they may well have been stealing to order
3555410 unsubstantiated information was received by co14 relating to the disappearance of madeleine mccann

3555417 in russia where the transition from one kind of government to another was much more abrupt post soviet governments have been grappling with limited success to make a new identity for russia by using history these days the russians say we live in a country with an unpredictable past while the new order clearly does not want to celebrate the november 7 anniversary of the bolshevik revolution of 1917 it does not want to alienate the citizenry by getting rid of what has been a two day holiday when boris yeltsin was in power he kept the holiday but renamed it the day of accord and reconciliation the public remained largely in ignorance of the change in 2005 putin moved the holiday a couple of days forward to november 4 and christened it the day of national unity the change in date is to commemorate russian success in driving out polish invaders in 1612 the public apart from radical nationalists still has no idea of what the holiday is supposed to be celebrating

3555423 our industry has become complacent in marketing what we have to the general public everybody thinks every family in minnesota has a pair of skates in the closet but thats not the case anymore
3555424 the funnest part for me is learning new things like how to go around in a circle
3555425 they are all very caring of the other skaters it is a nice community feeling
3555426 from the fact that people are very different it follows that if we treat them equally the result must be inequality in their actual position and that the only way to place them in an equal position would be to treat them differently equality before the law and material equality are therefore not only different but are in conflict which each other and we can achieve either one or the other but not both at the same time
3555427 if liberal mps are allowed to publicly use offensive language like thibaults without consequence it shows that stephane dions commitment to women in politics rings hollow

3555436 when you call them up in the middle of the night theyve got to drop everything and run

3555442 you lose a certain kind of innocence when you experience this type of kindness you lose your right to be a jaded cynic you can no longer go back through the looking glass and pretend not to know what you know about kindness its a defeat in a way
3555443 people kept showing me unreasonable kindness inexplicable kindness indefensible kindness people were kind when they knew that nobody would ever notice much less praise them for it people were even kind when they knew i wouldnt appreciate it
3555444 i had no idea how to live up to that kindness
3555445 what do you do with kindness like that i felt tiny beside it and stupid for not understanding the first thing about it it was bewildering and humbling to keep discovering how many brave things people can fail to talk themselves out of doing
3555446 i was helpless in trying to return peoples kindness but also helpless to resist it kindness is a scarier force than cruelty thats for sure cruelty isnt that hard to understand i had no trouble comprehending why the phone company wanted to screw me over they just wanted to steal some money it was nothing personal thats the way of the world it made me mad but it didnt make me feel stupid if anything it flattered my intelligence accepting all the kindness though made me feel stupid
3555447 i found myself forced to let go of all sorts of independence i thought i had independence i had spent years trying to cultivate

3555507 ppp contractual arrangements are usually very complex and this adds a layer of cost to the significant burden associated with bidding for major projects which is already an issue for the new zealand construction industry

3555592 a strange coincidence around the murder of paul johnson is that the saudi police apparently cooperated with those who abducted him why would a security service trained by american and british c i a fronts like the vinnell corp cooperate with al qaeda their purported enemy
3555593 this is the second time during the last weeks that saudi security forces have cooperated with al qaeda if this starts happening regularly it would suggest either a very grave instability in the kingdom or that the saudi security forces are run in accordance with american interests

3555595 on behalf of my people i would like to say that we deny that the terror practices of al qaeda represent islam and moslems in any way we are against the instrumentalization of islam and all moslems by the cia through their front organization al qaeda this disgusting criminal gang has already caused too much death and suffering for innocents of all creeds in many lands we reject the al qaeda announcement to killing innocent people under the name of islam for revenge of the injustices comitted against palestinians we reject all al qaeda practices as these crimes are against humanity these crimes are all steered from washington by the cia and they only represent u s policy
3555596 the al qaeda terror organization has caused immense damage to islam to moslems worldwide and to the interests of the peoples of all arab and muslim countries

3555622 when i heard i was selected it left me speechless
3555623 when you look at the list of past academic all americans of the year it is an impressive list and to know that i was the first person to win the award twice i am truly honored i had always set high goals for myself when i came to nebraska but those were always focused around volleyball such as being an all american and earning academic all american honors i never thought i would be compared to the best student athletes from other sports across the country for an award such as this and to be chosen as the academic all american of the year twice is something i would have never dreamed of
3555624 it was a lifestyle choice i made early on i didnt come to college and think now i have to study more education was always a priority in my family growing up i was going to college to get an education and having the opportunity to play volleyball was a bonus realizing that my academics were my priority i was fortunate to have people such as dennis leblanc and keith zimmer in our academic office they understood my personality and were always there to help me out they were mentors to me and were always there to give advice and help balancing a demanding major and a high level sport takes a strong commitment and dennis and keith were able to break things down for me and took care of so many things without them it would have been overwhelming
3555625 with nearly 12 000 student athletes being nominated for academic all america each year and considering the number of athletes competing in intercollegiate sports to reach the epitome of what it means to be a successful student athlete and be selected as the best of the best is quite an amazing achievement

3555709 baudrillard seeks to extend consumption from goods not only to services but to virtually everything else
3555710 art has likewise failed to realize the utopian aesthetic of modern times to transcend itself and become an ideal form of life in earlier times of course art had no need of self transcendence no need to become a totality for such a totality already existed in the shape of religion instead of being subsumed in a transcendent ideality art has been dissolved within a general aestheticization of everyday life giving way to a pure circulation of images a transaesthetics of banality indeed art took this route even before capital for if the decisive political event was the strategic crisis of 1929 whereby capital debouched into the era of mass transpolitics the crucial moment for art was undoubtedly that of dada and duchamp that moment when art by renouncing its own aesthetic rules of the game debouched into the transaesthetic era of the banality of the image
3555711 one might also consider the transvestites of the aesthetic sphere of whom andy warhol must surely be the emblematic figure like michael jackson andy warhol is a solitary mutant a precursor for his part of a perfect and universal hybridization of art of a new aesthetic to end all aesthetics like jackson he is a perfectly artificial personality he too is innocent and pure an androgyne of the new generation a sort of mystical prosthesis or artificial machine capable thanks to its perfection of releasing us at one blow from the grip of both sex and aesthetics when warhol says all works are beautiful i dont have to choose between them because all contemporary works are equivalent when he says art is everywhere therefore it no longer exists everyone is a genius the world as it is in its very banality is inhabited by genius nobody is ready to believe him yet his is in fact an accurate description of the shape of the modern aesthetic of radical agnosticism we are all agnostics transvestites of art or of sex none of us has either aesthetic or sexual convictions any longer yet we all profess to have them
3555712 we see art proliferating wherever we turn talk about art is increasing even more rapidly but the soul of art art as adventure art with its power of illusion its capacity for negating reality for setting up an other scene in opposition to reality where things obey a higher set of rules a transcendent figure in which beings like line and colour on a canvas are apt to lose their meaning to extend themselves beyond their own raison detre and in an urgent process of seduction to rediscover their ideal form even though this form may be that of their own destruction in this sense art is gone art has disappeared as a symbolic pact as something thus clearly distinct from that pure and simple production of aesthetic values that proliferation of signs ad infinitum that recycling of past and present forms which we call culture there are no more fundamental rules no more criteria of judgement or of pleasure in the aesthetic realm of today there is no longer any god to recognize his own or to use a different metaphor there is no gold standard of aesthetic judgement or pleasure the situation resembles that of a currency which may not be exchanged it can only float its only reference itself impossible to convert into real value or wealth art too must circulate at top speed and is impossible to exchange works of art are indeed no longer exchanged whether for each other or against a referential value they no longer have that secret collusiveness which is the strength of a culture we no longer read such works we merely decode them according to ever more contradictory criteria nothing in this sphere conflicts with anything else neo geometrism neo expressionism new abstraction new representationalism all coexist with a marvellous facility amid general indifference it is only because none of these tendencies has any soul of its own that they can all inhabit the same cultural space only because they arouse nothing but profound indifference in us that we can accept them all simultaneously the art world presents a curious aspect it is as though art and artistic inspiration had entered a kind of stasis as though everything which had developed magnificently over several centuries had suddenly been immobilized paralysed by its own image and its own riches behind the whole convulsive movement of modern art lies a kind of inertia something that can no longer transcend itself and has therefore turned in upon itself merely repeating itself at a faster and faster rate on the one hand then a stasis of the living form of art and at the same time a proliferative tendency wild hyperbole and endless variations on all earlier forms the life moving of itself of that which is dead all this is logical enough where there is stasis there is metastasis when a living form becomes disordered when as in cancer a genetically determined set of rules ceases to function the cells begin to proliferate chaotically just as some biological disorders indicate a break in the genetic code so the present disorder in art may be interpreted as a fundamental break in the secret code of aesthetics by its liberation of form line colour and aesthetic notions as by its mixing up of all cultures all styles our society has given rise to a general aestheticization all forms of culture not excluding anti cultural ones are promoted and all models of representation and anti representation are taken on board whereas art was once essentially a utopia that is to say ultimately unrealizable today this utopia has been realized thanks to the media computer science and video technology everyone is now potentially a creator even anti art the most radical of artistic utopias was realized once duchamp had mounted his bottle dryer and andy warhol had wished he was a machine all the industrial machinery in the world has acquired an aesthetic dimension all the worlds insignificance has been transfigured by the aestheticizing process it is often said that the wests great undertaking is the commercialization of the whole world the hitching of the fate of everything to the fate of the commodity that great undertaking will turn out rather to have been the aestheticization of the whole world its cosmopolitan spectacularization its transformation into images its semiological organization what we are witnessing beyond the materialist rule of the commodity is a semio urgy of everything by means of advertising the media or images no matter how marginal or banal it may be everything is subject to aestheticization culturalization museumification everything is said everything is exposed everything acquires the force or the manner of a sign the system runs less on the surplus value of the commodity than on the aesthetic surplus value of the sign there is much talk of a dematerialization of art as evidenced supposedly by minimalism conceptual art ephemeral art anti art and a whole aesthetic of transparency disappearance and disembodiment in reality however what has occurred is a materialization of aesthetics everywhere under an operational form it is indeed because of this that art has been obliged to minimize itself to mime its own disappearance it has been doing this for a century already duly obeying all the rules like all disappearing forms art seeks to duplicate itself by means of simulation but it will nevertheless soon be gone leaving behind an immense museum of artificial art and abandoning the field completely to advertising a dizzying eclecticism of form a dizzying eclecticism of pleasure such already was the agenda of the baroque for the baroque however the vortex of artifice has a fleshly aspect like the practicioners of the baroque we too are irrepressible creators of images but secretly we are iconoclasts not in the sense that we destroy images but in the sense that we manufacture a profusion of images in which there is nothing to see most present day images be they video images paintings products of the plastic arts or audiovisual or synthesized images are literally images in which there is nothing to see they leave no trace cast no shadow and have no consequences the only feeling one gets from such images is that behind each one there is something that has disappeared the fascination of a monochromatic picture is the marvellous absence of form the erasure though still in the form of art of all aesthetic syntax similarly the fascination of transsexuality is the erasure though in the form of spectacle of sexual difference these are images that conceal nothing that reveal nothing that have a kind of negative intensity the only benefit of a campbells soup can by andy warhol and it is an immense benefit is that it releases us from the need to decide between beautiful and ugly between real and unreal between transcendence and immanence just as byzantine icons made it possible to stop asking whether god existed without for all that ceasing to believe in him this is indeed the miraculous thing our images are like icons they allow us to go on believing in art while eluding the question of its existence so perhaps we ought to treat all present day art as a set of rituals and for ritual use only perhaps we ought to consider art solely from an anthropological standpoint without reference to any aesthetic judgement whatsoever the implication is that we have returned to the cultural stage of primitive societies the speculative fetishism of the art market itself partakes of the ritual of arts transparency we find ourselves in the realm either of ultra or of infra aesthetics it is pointless to try to endow our art with an aesthetic consistency or an aesthetic teleology that would be like looking for the blue of the sky at the level of infrared or ultraviolet rays in this sense therefore inasmuch as we have access to neither the beautiful nor the ugly and are incapable of judging we are condemned to indifference beyond this indifference however another kind of fascination emerges a fascination which replaces aesthetic pleasure for once liberated from their respective constraints the beautiful and the ugly in a sense multiply they become more beautiful than beautiful more ugly than ugly thus painting currently cultivates if not ugliness exactly which remains an aesthetic value then the uglier than ugly the bad the worse kitsch an ugliness raised to the second power because it is liberated from any relationship with its opposite once freed from the true mondrian we are at liberty to out mondrian mondrian freed from the true naifs we can paint in a way that is more naif than naif and so on and once freed from reality we can produce the realer than real hyperrealism it was in fact with hyperrealism and pop art that everything began that everyday life was raised to the ironic power of photographic realism today this escalation has caught up every form of art every style and all without discrimination have entered the transaesthetic world of simulation there is a parallel to this escalation in the art market itself here too because an end has been put to any deference to the law of value to the logic of commodities everything has become more expensive than expensive expensive as it were squared prices are exorbitant the bidding has gone through the roof just as the abandonment of all aesthetic ground rules provokes a kind of brush fire of aesthetic values so the loss of all reference to the laws of exchange means that the market hurtles into unrestrained speculation the frenzy the folly the sheer excess are the same the promotional ignition of art is directly linked to the impossibility of all aesthetic evaluation in the absence of value judgements value goes up in flames and it goes up in a sort of ecstasy there are two art markets today one is still regulated by a hierarchy of values even if these are already of a speculative kind the other resembles nothing so much as floating and uncontrollable capital in the financial market it is pure speculation movement for movements sake with no apparent purpose other than to defy the law of value this second market has much in common with poker or potlatch it is a kind of space opera in the hyperspace of value should we be scandalized no there is nothing immoral here just as present day art is beyond beautiful and ugly the market for its part is beyond good and evil
3555713 people in china especially parents and college students are suddenly becoming aware of huge depression and anxiety problems in young people
3555714 in this generation every child is raised to be at the top
3555715 theyve worked hard for it and its what their parents have focused their lives on but the problem is that the country cant provide the lifestyle they feel they deserve only a few will get it
3555716 he might not focus as much on class if his parent wasnt there
3555717 by high school my parents knew i could control myself and only do homework
3555718 many people come home to have dinner and then study until bed
3555719 you have to do it to go to the best university and get a good job you must do this to live
3555720 produce a generation of high quality children to facilitate chinas introduction as a global power
3555721 people in china especially parents and college students are suddenly becoming aware of huge depression and anxiety problems in young people
3555722 the media report on new campus suicides all the time
3555723 in this generation every child is raised to be at the top
3555724 theyve worked hard for it and its what their parents have focused their lives on but the problem is that the country cant provide the lifestyle they feel they deserve only a few will get it
3555725 because of the cultural revolution my parents literally wasted 10 years
3555726 i was explicitly told that they had lost a lot in their lives so they wanted me to get it back for them
3555727 in china the term for a one child family is a risky family
3555728 if something happened to that child it would be a disaster so from the parents point of view the spoiling is all necessary to protect them
3555729 does this mean everything i have would have to be cut in half or shared no i dont want that
3555730 the only way only children are reliably different from others is they score slightly higher in academic achievement
3555731 pinning their problems on having no siblings is really making them a scapegoat
3555732 these kids have the same dreams as all middle class kids to go to college to get white collar jobs to own their own home to have nikes and name brands
3555733 they expect things that are normal in developed countries but by chinas standards are unheard of
3555734 it was after they got a bad grade on a test
3555735 they think to die is better than to have that bad mark
3555736 that one grade becomes the only standard to justify you as a person
3555737 if you have a good personality or maybe youre good in math but not chinese all of that is your downfall because its all about your grade
3555738 but all the other students do the extra homework so if you do not do it you will lag behind
3555739 with the click of a button they go from a 19 year old with no social life to a great warrior in world of warcraft
3555740 why bother doing things in the real world when they can be in this game and be fulfilled
3555741 they have trouble adjusting to the idea that theyre going to be working class
3555742 its not like american universities where you have many friends
3555743 at chinese universities you compete for limited resources and everyone is concerned about themselves and if you wanted to talk to your parents they wouldnt understand when they were your age they were reading maos little red book
3555744 in the 20th century the term depression didnt even exist in china
3555745 it couldnt be talked about because there was no vocabulary for it yet
3555746 back then every mental problem was seen as anti socialist
3555747 if you were depressed they thought you were politically impure and sent you to a labor camp
3555748 people in china have more knowledge about mental health today

3555791 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3555792 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3555793 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3555794 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3555795 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3555804 a pessoa acaba recorrendo a um agiota pega todas as economias e gasta em orienta o de projeto de planejamento faz outros investimentos e quando chega na hora de fazer o capital de giro precisa de um banco e capital de giro car ssimo mais f cil e barato pegar um investimento inicial em um banco de desenvolvimento e usar seu capital pr prio de giro depois
3555805 se a pessoa n o tiver dinheiro para come ar um neg cio e tamb m n o tiver possibilidade de consegui lo complicado voc pode come ar o neg cio de forma mais simples n o exagerar muito no empreendimento procurar economizar o m ximo poss vel e o dinheiro certamente fundamental ou ent o voc pode investir em um neg cio que precise pouco de capital inicial

3555807 tem gente que quer fazer duas tr s coisas ao mesmo tempo isso prejudicial voc tira a aten o para o neg cio nem sempre as pessoas conseguem se dedicar a uma coisa s mas h maior possibilidade de sucesso se o foco estiver em um neg cio espec fico se houver planejamento adequado e claro ter tamb m a voca o para ser empres rio
3555808 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3555809 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3555810 lack of discussion could mean that people are fine with how things are now besides you
3555811 in this situation your going to need contributors to that book to participate in the discussions voice opinions on what should be changed in written form on wiki and come to some sort of consensus before anything changes regardless of any individuals interpretation

3555816 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3555861 as you know through the nato membership that if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
3555862 we dont have i think right now the ability to intervene in any way except in a humanitarian economic way and do what we can to help the georgians
3555863 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country
3555864 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties

3555869 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3555870 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3555871 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3555872 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3555873 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3555874 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3555875 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3555876 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3555877 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3555878 if this scenario had happened nine months ago he wouldnt have been captured or he would have asked for help and they would have let him go

3555888 realistic about the ability of cities such as manchester leeds and newcastle to regenerate struggling nearby towns such as liverpool bradford and sunderland
3555889 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3555890 outstanding post its great to read about your success and how youve made it happen im going to
3555891 great points well presented i agree with you i did a post on october 12th that presented five
3555892 okay stop distracting me im trying to work here and i cant do it while laughing so hard
3555893 i too would prefer to hear from practioners and peers whether in person or remote if the
3555894 its appalling that cancer patients in england are forced to cut back on basic necessities like food to pay for their urgently needed medication people must never be forced to choose between food or medication the government must act now
3555895 patients should be allowed to focus on getting better instead of worrying how theyre going to find money for prescriptions
3555896 my treatments over but im still struggling im now on statutory sick pay because ive been too unwell to work and quite frankly have barely enough money to live on
3555897 there were georgian attacks overnight but our troops are in full control of the city so far weve had no orders to move south into georgia
3555898 there was a great wave of pressure which twisted me and flung me against the kitchen wall
3555899 this land is my body my home we are a proud beautiful people and we are not leaving i survived i am alive
3555900 we are raising a toast to those who are left
3555901 those tanks in the street we hit them with rocket propelled grenades from the basement
3555902 the georgians were 30 times stronger than us they wanted to kill us to destroy everything but we held them off
3555903 those who perpetrated this horror are criminals who must be punished by god this war is a result of georgian fascism which has flourished with the support of the west
3555904 is the help we received from russia which do you think we should chose
3555905 ive never heard anything so monstrous as people shelling a hospital
3555906 we managed to escape to the shelter just in time
3555907 the georgians could not get tanks through these narrow streets so first they turned it to ruins with a grad attack and tried to punch through here to the centre of the city there was heavy fighting in the streets i think more than 500 bodies were pulled out of this part of town
3555908 i personally saw one man beheaded lying in the street and others say they witnessed civilians who had been finished off with a shot to the back of the head
3555909 its like riding a bicycle its like i never left
3555910 i just wanted to go out and gauge how i feel
3555911 i felt okay i just got some new stuff orthotics in my shoes and this is the first day i ran in them my feet are a little sore right now so its something i have to get used to once i get used to it and get the soreness out ill be back out here
3555912 this always happens in training camp feagles and i hook up for one of the greatest catches in practice
3555913 i pushed off a little bit are they going to call it on me probably not they didnt call it on me a few years back when i got shoved in the 2002 nfc wild card game in san francisco
3555914 wide receivers coach mike sullivan and i have a close relationship
3555915 coach sully always told me to go up at the highest point and get the ball dont let the ball come down to you i have to give a lot of credit to coach flats offensive line coach pat flaherty for working on my get offs from the line and coach sullivan for teaching me how to catch
3555916 he was giving me some pointers all the hard work paid off
3555917 id love to score a touchdown in a game its nice to celebrate them too
3555918 it slipped out of my hand and i looked like a fool
3555919 i was a chatter in the portland yahoo regional rooms
3555920 i like many had the notion that individuals going online to solicit kids would be arrested that cops were all over the chatrooms monitoring things however week after week passed and the same guys who would mass post things like any 14 to 15 year olds in here want to make money modeling and other solicitations would still be there it was disturbing
3555921 kneeled meekly and struggled naught sic as his death was thrust upon him bending to the will of the kidnappers
3555922 the asshole yes the asshole screamed in english pleading for his life
3555923 let me be the first and probably only american to wish for his speedy death no life of such a worm a coward can be considered important
3555924 i wish i could fucking kill 9 11 conspiracy theorists yes kill id like to kill them kill them all i want you to die i wish you would die why dont you die just die
3555925 my old name was the name my father gave me
3555926 being that my father had no role in my upbringing as a teen i did not see the logic in being stuck with his name so i took my mothers name as a tribute to her and a new first name
3555927 the site has grown and evolved because people have come to it and suggested ideas come up with technological improvements etc i just organize and direct it i try not to take credit for the site succeeding the credit goes to how pervasive the problem is online and how dedicated people are toward fighting it
3555928 simply werent moving fast enough for my tastes considering how bold he was getting about his threats
3555929 w hen you attempt to threaten members of perverted justice com this can happen to you tonight bruce raisley stood around at an airport flowers in hand waiting for a woman that turned out to be a man hes not in love he has destroyed his relationship with his wife he has denigrated her and he has betrayed all those around him he has no one he has no more secrets we at perverted justice com will only tolerate so much in the way of threats and attacks upon us
3555930 as much as i hated bruce raisley for what he tried to do
3555931 i felt bad for him in the sense that the guy definitely has some mental issues my hope is that raisley gets mental health help he sticks with his wife and they live a happy threatening and harassing free life the head game that was played with him was only done in order to knock him out so to speak
3555932 hes already lost one job over this and he doesnt want anybody to know about it im just hoping this will just fade away
3555933 it would be the first back end deal in the history of journalism
3555934 we literally could not keep our website up anymore due to the site traffic at that point it was either no more datelines or a consultation fee at the end of the day the cameramen were getting paid chris hansen was getting paid the producers of dateline were getting paid the police were paying themselves via public funds to do the arrests the guy who owns the house was getting compensated the security there was being paid so it was only natural to seek compensation for the expensive work that we do
3555935 weve crawled into bed with the cops people think this will be the pickup truck for the new decade
3555936 one of these guys is going to go home and shoot himself in the head the perverted justice people are insane and theyll do something to embarrass us one of the biggest corporations in the world ought to find a better target than skanky guys in shorts
3555937 that somewhere down the line some district attorney is going to ask us for outtakes or footage from a story and were going to say we dont do that because we dont want to be an agent of the police
3555938 i have a real problem with any citizens group conducting any investigation into any crime
3555939 its a mistake for law enforcement to abdicate its responsibility to citizens
3555940 how would you feel if the media rented a house in your neighborhood and drew 30 people whove demonstrated a propensity for children to your house what happens when they flee at a high rate of speed and they t bone your wifes car we would never set up a sting in a residential neighborhood
3555941 weve talked to kids and i think sexual solicitations online are something theyve come to expect to happen
3555942 its fairly common for them to see these things and experience them
3555943 its good that people are aware on the other hand its blown very far out of extreme it tells you one small piece of the story it can distort the truth and present this false fear
3555944 several weeks worth there are a lot of people who would like to see it as a show

3555969 they talked about killing my father and sodomizing him and my brother she said
3555970 i appreciate the fact that its here because i use it every day 7 days a week
3555971 the fact that people are staying home a little more that people come to the library for practical help like looking for jobs
3555972 why do people come here to the business and career center
3555973 p eople come here to research potential job opportunities they come here to look at our resources for how to craft a resume
3555974 where you see people in times that are unsettled they choose to come together in a sense of community and a sense of reaffirming their humanity and i think thats a fabulous element that the library adds to eugene
3555975 issues are the last things a kid needs at college and macs have fewer issues with viruses malware and icky stuff like that
3555976 the title of the show is exactly what it will be
3555977 we will have a level of access that few programs in the country allow well be at every practice in the locker room and behind the scenes every football saturday this will truly be an inside look at michigan football
3555978 theyve done enough to convince us that they can contribute as freshmen and i think as much mentally as physically the biggest drawback for a freshman coming in is can they mentally handle the schemes and the pace all the things that go on with it those two have shown that they can
3555979 i pray to god you never throw the ball like that in a game
3555980 it is not our goal to reduce them to rubble but to reduce them to dust
3555981 we dont know what hes complaining about he knew when he signed on that we were planning a shit movie with shit art he was like yeah like good luck chuck no problem its a kate hudson movie they cant all be hostel fucking douchebag
3555982 it is not our goal to reduce them to rubble but to reduce them to dust
3555983 it is not our goal to reduce them to rubble but to reduce them to dust
3555984 but also dissapointed cause it wasnt widget ready so i jumped on
3555985 billions of dead things buried in rock layers laid down by water all over the earth
3555986 it is he who sits above the circle of the earth
3555987 the loudest criticism came from those who complained that the cool animatronic dinosaurs are displayed as coexisting with humans they were supposed to be dead for millions of years before humans existed if thats true then who drew all those cave drawings that look like dinosaurs
3555988 and what of that tyrannosaurus rex found in montana that contained soft tissue and blood vessels can blood vessels really last 65 million years
3555989 but these organisms are incredibly tiny less than 1000 angstroms typically so if enough of them were alive in the oceans to form a layer hundreds of feet thick there would have been no ocean at all the water would be so thick that you wouldnt have to be jesus to walk across it that would have killed off every other form of life in the ocean for crying out loud
3555990 it is he who sits above the circle of the earth
3555991 so what yeah and theres a shale bed in between those beds that is 1 cm thick that represents 500 000 years whats your point
3555992 and what of that tyrannosaurus rex found in montana that contained soft tissue and blood vessels can blood vessels really last 65 million years
3555993 denizens of the ocean bottom were overcome by the flood waters first and should lie in the lower strata
3555994 limestone for example is deposited primarily in shallow marine environments where the calcium carbonate can leech out over vast periods of time this is how coral reefs which are almost 100 calcium carbonate are formed
3555995 tidal wave is an apt name for them its like the tide is coming in really fast what normally takes six hours occurs in about 10 minutes
3555996 especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion this has to change
3555997 the child on camera had to be flawless in looks in her feelings and in her expression
3555998 she is already well on her way to becoming a star thanks to her heart warming performance
3555999 it was the image of our national music our national culture and especially since it accompanied the arrival of the national flag in the arena this was an extremely serious matter
3556000 when lin miaoke was singing on friday she may not have realised that was not her own voice
3556001 mostly an animated three dimensional video that was made over a year it was not actually live footage except the final stage
3556002 looking at it from today the video was a bit brighter than the real fireworks
3556003 the reason why little peiyi was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image the reason was for the national interest
3556004 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect
3556005 i dont think we want to get drawn into a row with the chinese
3556006 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
3556007 the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it i can resist everything but temptation
3556008 this creatures power and toughness are each equal to the number of charge counters on it
3556009 eraserheads members should not allow themselves to be deceived by philip morris and should protect their fans from this devious marketing ploy considered one of the most influential bands in the philippines eraserheads has become a role model for our youth i hope they will rise to the challenge and help young filipinos lead healthy tobacco free lives by finding other sponsorship for the concert
3556010 once again philip morris international has been caught engaging in cigarette marketing that appeals to children in a developing country and that would not be tolerated in the united states and other wealthier nations
3556011 the issue isnt just whether philip morris international has violated philippine law but whether tobacco companies should be engaged in such youth oriented marketing anywhere philip morris international should immediately cease all such sponsorships and promotions in all countries
3556012 you have to create national consciousness among the majority of the people
3556013 ramons 100 mile run wasnt just about enduring the distance or seeing how hard and far he could push his body
3556014 it was a dream come true just to race here
3556015 was to reach over the table and punch the doctor who was giving me the news
3556016 if certain tests had come back elevated my parents would have stepped in
3556017 is there anything that can be done to fill at least a few of these positions
3556018 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3556019 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3556020 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3556021 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3556022 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3556023 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3556024 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3556025 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3556026 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010
3556027 it was agreed that queensland would be the host state which im particularly proud of
3556028 we have not seen anything of this scale in a long time
3556029 would not be in the best interest of the community
3556030 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3556031 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbi s first century
3556032 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3556033 i think whats interesting is after all these years that would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3556034 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
3556035 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous
3556036 in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
3556037 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting
3556038 can you leave me alone im trying to get gas and this is really harassment please leave me alone
3556039 we are very pleased to have monica join community bancorp she will be able to provide us with needed expertise through her tremendous amount of experience and knowledge she is truly a welcome addition to the management group

3556046 maine families and businesses are struggling under the high price of gas and heating oil
3556047 we need a president who will stand up for mainers by delivering relief today while building a secure energy future john mccain is offering more of the same with his plan to give 4 billion more in tax breaks for oil and gas companies barack obama understands the enormity of this crisis and has put forward common sense solutions that will ease the pain at the pump and move america to energy independence

3556064 i think this really is a pretty clear indication rather than it being climate change causing the rapid extinction of the tasmanian mega fauna which was the current orthodoxy
3556065 i dont know from a city perspective if we have the authority to say no or not
3556066 the mayors request for a review is not only for the long term and the general but i think that the review is also looking at this particular site and what it should be as well
3556067 i believe thats part of the scope of whats being done here
3556068 i think well get a little bit loud because us italians have a tendency of getting a little bit loud but i dont expect any problems
3556069 the people are very frustrated and they want answers we want to know how this facility got the permit to be there and what happened and who is responsible for it
3556070 im not against having propane facilities but i think they should be away from residential and also industrial areas they have to be isolated
3556071 were going ahead with the funerals but are doing an abbreviated version
3556072 there will be no visitations families can do the burial say prayers at the gravesite and then will immediately have to leave the grounds
3556073 i was still annoyed about the loss i didnt think we played our best soccer but its a mix of emotions im thrilled were through but
3556074 since ive been on the team we have not beaten or tied the u
3556075 every now and then they give us a good spanking to remind us we have a long way to go
3556076 it was a high level soccer game played by two strong teams
3556077 but i dont think the players were satisfied with it
3556078 the joined up approach taken by the three agencies is a welcome step forward and we fully support this initiative it simplifies the whole process of sorting out the mess left behind by fraudsters and helps victims get their finances back on track
3556079 becoming a victim of identity theft can be extremely distressing
3556080 by jointly taking on responsibility for managing the recovery process the three credit reference agencies are aiming to make getting financially back on track much easier for the individual involved
3556081 the bank advises that it has made this decision after its board assessed the current economic climate the uncertainty in world financial markets and the risks involved in integrating these complex businesses at this time
3556082 the bank believes that given these factors it would not be in the best interests of shareholders to proceed with the acquisition in this environment
3556083 we continue to anticipate stable market conditions for our plasma therapies business and growing contribution from royalties associated with the international sales of gardasil
3556084 the acquisition will make csl a stronger competitor in the highly competitive plasma therapeutics market place
3556085 que nos muestra que la transici n de china hacia una econom a de bajos niveles de emisiones de co2 est en marcha

3556088 en nuestra sociedad hay salidas para todos incluso hasta para las personas que son poco inteligentes pues siempre stas tendr n la oportunidad de dedicarse a la banca y al comercio
3556089 brick and mortar business it truly is the greatest frontier for any small business
3556090 i have not been forced or pressured to make this decision
3556091 the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence have forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3556092 my instinctive reaction to this realization has been to soldier on but i have too much respect for myself my family the school the students the faculty and the staff to continue
3556093 baby blings line of pacifiers and pacifier holders available at sandbox couture
3556094 when he talked about skipping mid week service to go to the lake and buying a new boat when you havent tithed i felt nailed to my pew
3556095 it was like the holy spirit was speaking right to me
3556096 if this scenario had happened nine months ago he wouldnt have been captured or he would have asked for help and they would have let him go
3556097 thats a clear indication of the change of attitude taking place among tijuana police
3556098 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3556099 the metaphysician martyr giordano bruno might have called them star beasts
3556100 talks will never collapse as long as we have tongues
3556101 rashad is having a great camp he came into camp in the best shape of his life he is fit and lean out there which is hard to believe for a guy of his size he is in great shape and it is really showing in his play on the field
3556102 as a ball carrier there are very few things that he hasnt mastered in our offense we are running him on the inside zone and the power sweep which are kind of the beard and butter plays for us right now
3556103 i think the areas where he has made the most improvement this summer is in his ability to pass protect and understand the pass protection secondly as a receiver this guy can really catch the football you are really seeing a very versatile athlete out there who is very committed and focused toward having a great season
3556104 brock has made a ton of progress and we are really proud of him things didnt come easy for brock during our first season here we were forced in and out of making some decisions
3556105 during brocks junior year we got on a roll in weeks five and six and he helped carry that roll and momentum through the season he certainly carried that momentum into the offseason and during the spring and even into training camp this august
3556106 he has a really good understanding and mastery of the passing game he knows his reads and he understands the protection he is making a lot of really good decisions out there i think there are some days that he throws it better than others but that is kind of common when you are in the middle of camp it is not easy to keep your focus up during the entire length of camp
3556107 the nice thing that brock really has is that is he has confidence in his arm he has got a strong strong arm there are some throws that he can make that im not sure anyone else in our league can make right now im really excited about where brock is and he is really showing up as a leader on our football team
3556108 what is happening with zach right now is that we are utilizing him the best of his ability he is a guy who is a hybrid between a running back and a wide receiver we have a number of sets and formations where he will be in the backfield with rashad or by himself sometime he will line up as a wide receiver where we will throw to him or just hand it off to him on a reserve play
3556109 we have really put together a great package for zach to take advantage of his talents and his abilities he also is in the best shape of his life and very much committed to being at his best
3556110 i really think he has come to the realization he is capable of doing his job that we have asked of him during the spring i think it was a little too much both mentally and physically but he worked really hard this summer as a receiver obviously he is a natural runner and by working as a wide receiver he has really made himself the complete package
3556111 first of all we are really happy to have him back it was very concerning when he fractured his ankle down at gardner webb last year and you kind of wonder if it was going to be possible to come back healthy from an injury like that
3556112 i think in a lot of ways mike has taken it upon himself to be the heart and soul of our offense he is constantly talking out there and encouraging as he is one of the vocal leaders for sure on our offense
3556113 i think the thing about mike is that he has a lot of energy and enthusiasm for the game but now i think he is at a point where his play is at such a level that is it allowing his leadership qualities to really take over
3556114 it is hard to lead when you are struggling personally but he is playing so well right now that it is easy for him to step into the leadership role he is a tough physical football player who has learned to master his position
3556115 the decision to redshirt corey last year is one of those decisions that you look back on and say that we made a great decision he is doing really well as he is the kind of player in my opinion is the true versatile tight end
3556116 he is big enough strong enough and physical enough to play at the point of attack he can block the power play and block the toss play and he can cut off in the inside zone physically he can do all of those jobs that you need a tight end to do
3556117 but athletically he is a very good receiver he is that cross between a physical blocking tight end and an athletic receiving tight end and he is capable of doing both very well we need to continue to find ways to keep him in the offense and find ways to give him the football in a lot of ways i think he is going to add value to our program
3556118 i think that josh weaver is having a great camp two years ago josh was going into summer camp as the starting right tackle he remained the starting right tackle right up to the week before the opening game against st paul then eddie pinigis transferred in and obviously eddie beat josh out for the starting job and eddie held that spot down until he graduated
3556119 we knew that josh had the ability and he really had a good summer in the weight room i think that every player goes through that transformation where you hurdle certain barriers that are out in front of you
3556120 i think that josh has hurdled most of the major barriers that he needs to hurdle at his position meaning strength issues and understanding the protections he is at the point where he is playing really well for us i think a tackle playing that well really solidifies our offensive line
3556121 of course martha is in a league of her own when it comes to cooking crafting gardening and entertaining
3556122 but now fln is going to give viewers a very different look at martha from an insider s perspective they would never otherwise have the result is great tv that s really fun to watch
3556123 we re delighted to extend our relationship with fine living with this innovative original series
3556124 and in between the laughter we think the audience might learn a little something along the way
3556125 the money is tax free and could help pay medical expenses or improve your quality of life
3556126 prior to this change retirees had to have 20 years of active duty service or be retired at age 60 from the guard or reserve
3556127 if you didnt have 20 years you werent eligible however with the ndaa expansion if you are medically retired either permanently or temporarily and you have va payments that reduce your retirement pay you are eligible to apply for crsc
3556128 that way if you do not qualify and something in the law or department of defense crsc policy changes in the future that could affect the prior decision like the 2008 ndaa we will already have a claim and documentation and can reassess a claim based on the new eligibility factors
3556129 if you answered yes to those questions and have not submitted your crsc claim you should do so
3556130 the money is tax free and could help pay medical expenses or improve your quality of life
3556131 theyre not fitting back into society their jobs or their families theyre feeling somewhat worthless and they need some help

3556134 if someone calls and they are in extreme distress or have immediate plans to hurt themselves we keep them on the phone and try to keep them talking to us and safe until we can get them immediate help
3556135 i had a friend of mine call army one source to say he was having suicidal thoughts
3556136 they told him to go online and take a personality test and call back with the results of that personality test thats unacceptable
3556137 we are really approaching it from the perspective of it takes a lot of courage to do this
3556138 youve shown us youve got courage by your participation in the military
3556139 we are extremely fortunate to have peter join our organization and at such an exciting time in the evolution of our company

3556154 the vast majority of the public have no idea we do a wide variety of things
3556155 we do everything from putting our fingers on the bleeding hole to injury prevention coordinating care alcohol and drug intervention programs research on drugs to help stop bleeding
3556156 we have the right number of people to help us put the finger on the hole adequately next we need to get to the number to help the community
3556157 this isnt the time to say i told you so
3556158 weve worked well and its a nice feeling where we are at the moment but theres no euphoria or feeling of told you so there is a much bigger prize
3556159 if we can beat canberra then the play offs are achievable
3556160 i have never felt anything other than what i thought was needed in terms of retaining or attaining the players we have
3556161 im not going to comment on whether brian smith has been vindicated for the changes he made last season
3556162 last year was last year and i will always want the knights to be successful but theres a right and wrong way of doing things and i think the way things were done last year was not right you cant help but put a lot of their success down to the form of kurt gidley and danny buderus
3556163 the decision to re sign kurt gidley early in the season has been the signing of the season
3556164 since chief executive steve burraston locked him up after round one or two he has improved out of sight
3556165 the five things you like most and least about this company
3556166 que me expliquen c mo una serie de dibujos animados para mayores de 13 a os es tildada de pornogr fica y sobre todo c mo es eso de que
3556167 las vascongadas para acabar con la subversi n roja y separatista
3556168 everyday in the newspapers there is at least one long story about presidential hopefuls senator barack obama or senator john mccain
3556169 i have thought for quite some time that semantics and definitions are problematic in many discussions about drugs many of the people with whom i ve spoken refer to drugs as medicine and recreational drugs as dope and many do not readily accept that nicotine and alcohol are recreational drugs to them they are booze amp cigarettes some would say that it makes no difference what you call something it is what it is
3556170 global competition in health care is allowing more patients from developed countries to travel for medical reasons to regions once characterized as third world many of these medical tourists are not wealthy but are seeking high quality medical care at affordable prices to meet the growing demand entrepreneurs are building technologically advanced facilities in india thailand latin america and elsewhere and are hiring physicians technicians and nurses trained to american and european standards to run them says devon herrick a senior fellow at the national center for policy analysis
3556171 what is a windfall profit anyway i would define a windfall profit as profit without any meaningful effort but liberals socialists have a different definition they seem to believe any profit above some arbitrary amount is fair game for a windfall profit tax but profits are good the profits from companies employ thousands of employees provide needed products pay billions in taxes and provide a stable income for investors
3556172 you are uptown in a shopping district of a small community and you pass by the meat shop the wine shop the coffee shop two churches side by side a coin shop an antique store and hold it right there a coin shop this is irresistible because as implausible as this may sound all political truth can be found in a coin shop
3556173 i watch this show every day everybody has issues with a lot of chatter back here pay attention one minute
3556174 i think people are a little jealous they dont look like that at her age
3556175 i retract all articles i have written that espouse anarcho capitalism i erroneously thought all human actions all products and services needed to be provided and obtained only through the free market there are many preconditions for the proper ordering of society a rational society the market is not at the head of the list the market does not encompass everything there are three services that cannot be market services for they are the things that make a free market possible
3556176 i was focused on the team effort but when we got this team gold medal i feel i shed a lot of burden and pressure
3556177 so i am in a relaxed mood to participate in the all around and the individual finals i also will try to get every gold medal i can
3556178 hes a machine right now hes absolutely incredible with what hes doing
3556179 if he has a good competition i dont think it will be possible to step up and overtake his position
3556180 but no matter what you do with this team we kept taking care of business we never got ourselves down never let ourselves doubt ourselves and we just kept fighting thats all we did gained momentum through the first few events and kept fighting
3556181 were not underdogs anymore were here we brought home a medal
3556182 i researched the word raptos of 1 thessalonians 4 17 i came up with raptos is latin the original greek word for this harpazo anglicized means either to snatch catch up or pluck or to save or rescue even though i have problems with preachers who turn one word into a whole theology especially one with multiple interpretations in this research i can only say that paul is saying snatched but is paul a prophet i e should every word that he writes be taken as a future prophecy or as a missionary and disciple whose letters to exhort converts get zealous
3556183 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
3556184 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
3556185 nave a nice day or not the choice is yours
3556186 my dream is to play in serie a and hopefully it will come sooner rather than later
3556187 but grosseto believed in me from the start and pushed me a long way i get on very well with our president and he is very honest but business is business
3556188 i dont think hes holding me back in any way i dont think any clubs would let players go for free theyre just waiting for the right offer it has pretty much just come down to that
3556189 he was the coach who initially brought me to grosseto
3556190 he knows me very well and rates me as a player so theres interest from that end but the coach often doesnt get his own way in italy there are a lot of other people involved in the decisions to buy players you dont know how much real interest there is in you until money has been offered
3556191 this club has been fantastic to me so i cant complain
3556192 the new coaching staff is fantastic i feel im an important part of the team if i do have to stay another season then it is not the end of the world serie b is a fantastic league and it gives you great exposure hopefully i can repeat my performance from last year and
3556193 it is a waste of time getting distracted thinking about a transfer im no use to the team or my team mates if i am thinking about going it all comes down to being professional ive been here a long time and its disrespectful to everybody if i go about it any other way
3556194 im upset i never expected fifa would ban me like this i hope the peruvian football federation fpf can do something for me because its unfair
3556195 i didnt hurt nor kill anybody to be given a six match ban
3556196 i only discussed with the referee im quite surprised it came as a complete shock i regret it because its made things worse for the team and i will miss the venezuela and argentina qualifiers
3556197 paolo guerrero has no previous examples of this type of behaviour
3556198 well do our best to see if we can reduce the ban at least
3556199 the referees report is catastrophic he said there was an aggressive attempt as well as insults to his authority
3556200 the foundations are strong and when it gets rocky the thing doesnt blow down theyre very good on their set plays tony obviously works hard on certain aspects of the game
3556201 he is an honest bloke and seems to be a great lad and that made it an easy decision to come here
3556202 i want to be playing top flight football and if i didnt believe stoke could stay up i wouldnt have come here
3556203 i dont know if ive picked up any of brian cloughs traits but i just feel very lucky and honoured to have played under him
3556204 he was an absolute genius and when i look back at the managers ive played under hes certainly no 1
3556205 the door is shut now the players cant go full stop
3556206 clubs are trying to unsettle some of my players i dont like it its my first job in the premier league and the last thing i want to do is sell my best players
3556207 benni is definitely one of them and theres plenty more as far as im concerned the situation is closed
3556208 theres always going to be speculation about players but i can categorically say 100 per cent that nobody will be leaving this club
3556209 robbie is okay hes fit but he just needs to get his sharpness and ive told him that
3556210 if we can get him right then theres no reason why he cant play a part in the season if you look at teddy sheringham he played until he was 41
3556211 i want to know who is who i need to know what the group want to achieve in the championship and the difficulties theyre facing then ill start planning the job
3556212 i cannot promise right now that well be top four at the end of the tournament but well try to clinch the necessary results to achieve that
3556213 i coached atletico in 2001 and then in 2003 and 2004 this trilogy needs a title in 2008 or 2009

3556228 x has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3556229 such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century xs government must respect ys territorial integrity and sovereignty
3556230 threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3556231 we are committed to working to ensure a peaceful and speedy resolution which maintains ys territorial and political integrity
3556232 the only language that bullies understand is when someone stands up to them what x has done here is used massive and disproportionate force its breached international law and it has violated ys territorial integrity it has acted as a massive and dangerous bully and we cant allow this to go ahead without it being challenged

3556235 one thing about paris hilton and her energy policy is that she brings energy to about whatever she does and she said that she was hot that
3556236 i guarantee old or not with paris hilton talking about energy them fellas barack obama and john mccain will be listening probably watching too
3556237 we d bypass them evan williams fellas who tried to insert themselves into the political process and influence the voters of kentucky that re doing here we re trying to get the energy right view story
3556238 what weve done is built away of patterning the essence of a video in a single pattern
3556239 appears to be from outside the u s no passport was found on dirie who is believed to have entered the country from canada
3556240 that nothing so far has been found to link the case to terrorism
3556241 that the world is full of depressing negative scary and sometimes overwhelming things
3556242 my throat is always sore my lips raw every time i try to talk to my parents or a teacher i sputter or freeze its like i have some kind of spastic laryngitis
3556243 were made out of the same stuff as the stars
3556244 but what about teenagers at the end of their tethers they know a lot more about life than i did at that age yet they are still looking for guidance and direction from society what do they think when they see some of australias leading childrens book writers and publishers producing such books for them
3556245 as educator jill ireland has pointed out in an article in education monitor many of the books teach that we live in a malevolent universe that must be fought with cunning that the human race is largely corrupt that institutions like family government or church are not even remotely helpful that relationships have only temporary value and that people are fundamentally solitary
3556246 in favour of a world that is not without its traumas but one in which both adults and adolescents work to make sense of their lives and get on with living
3556247 ok now you are a proficient reader go and choose a book for fun
3556248 scott has been one of the top up and coming coaches in hockey and with good reason
3556249 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation the entire islanders organization looks forward to working with scott
3556250 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3556251 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future
3556252 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
3556253 and i know hawaii is a state but it has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place he should be in myrtle beach if hes going to take a vacation at this time
3556254 yes obama cant help but look like a high flying elitist by spending his vacation in hawaii regardless of the fact that he was born there and that his grandmother lives there and the fact that you know hawaii is one of the 50 states
3556255 and while they are making arrangements to send sen obama to myrtle beach they need to get him to switch sports basketball is for elites after all real americans and real american presidents play golf in myrtle beach
3556256 saying our 50th state is somehow foreign does a great disservice to the hardworking patriotic americans who call hawaii home
3556257 for months people have been asking me when is sen obama going to come home im so glad he found time to visit his sister and his grandmother and for him and his family to bond and recharge in his home state hawaii is a great u s destination just ask the 5 5 million americans who visited last year for business and pleasure
3556258 aside from the general ridiculousness of casting aspersions on the american ness of hawaii ms roberts criticism smacks of the worst prejudices faced by asian americans im sure if he had decided to go to the exclusive golfing resort of myrtle beach instead the press would have dutifully reported how american his vacation was and how regular americans could identify with such a lavish trip
3556259 i would love to take ms roberts on a tour of oahu with stops at the arizona memorial and punchbowl followed by a visit with hawaii army national guard soldiers training for their second deployment to the middle east
3556260 then i would take her to eastside grill to watch team usa womens volleyball and bryan clay i would introduce her to hawaii residents so she could witness our diversity and learn about the aloha spirit part of what makes america great is the unique contributions of all 50 states sen obama has every right to come home and visit his sister and grandmother
3556261 cokie roberts represents an old mentality that grew up in white america
3556262 our struggle as a people and as a country is to rise above these old stereotypes she uses this cliche of hawaii but we are a very complex society where weve learned to live together and move together in a positive way hawaii is the prototype of how people can get along hawaii is the prototype for the nation
3556263 i thought this was going to be a light film
3556264 i was a bit baffled and then in a gentle yet thorough way he proceeded to list his complaints about the movie the parts in the story that made no sense and when he said them i could see that they were true this is something i usually do what happened in there
3556265 the reason why i like to see science fiction on a screen
3556266 is because it often conflrms my deepest fears and concerns about the direction were heading as a society i find it both comforting and anxiety provoking
3556267 i dont know if i want to be friends with you any longer because i hear youre not nice to your friends
3556268 a lot of times artists dont truly see their neighborhood
3556269 they dont think its as interesting as other places but of course it is
3556270 i like the way he frames things the shots he takes
3556271 ive always thought of it as a job never a career

3556275 el presidente tiene tambi n varias otras reuniones como suele ocurrir generalmente en este tipo de encuentros
3556276 la autonom a tiene retos impostergables uno de ellos responde a atender necesidades de grandes sectores amenazados por la incapacidad del gobierno nacional
3556277 yo sigo siendo el prefecto de cochabamba quiero ver que evo morales en un retroceso de la democracia ponga a dedo a un prefecto ser a un retroceso tremendo
3556278 estar a la defensa de la democracia y ese alguien soy yo
3556279 id prefer that it included a super majority requirement and an explicit set of reservations analogous to the constitutions bill of rights but weve learned from experience that putting national lawmaking authority solely in the hands of 537 people in washington results in a broken process dominated by corporate and sectional interests and geared toward protecting those interests rather than our rights
3556280 while many libertarians distrust democracy and fear its devolution into mob rule
3556281 it seems unlikely to me that the american people would legislate as corruptly and incompetently as their representatives in washington have the national initiative provides for a period of deliberation and debate with any new law requiring affirmation by voters in two separate elections meanwhile we frequently hear that congress has passed new legislation without waiting for it to be printed so that they can actually read it
3556282 when im 64 that he would be in the middle of a divorce in his 60s

3556294 tom was very very nervous more so than ever before and i think he really struggled to get through the competition
3556295 im not disappointed with my performance at all i landed on my head on every single dive which is what my aim was i could have dived better but it was hard work for me today
3556296 i was trying to calm him down but he had a pop at me before the last dive
3556297 when we were sitting down i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call but tom went to me what are you on the phone for were in a competition and weve got another dive to do
3556298 that is just thomas being over nervous thats how it was today tom should not be worrying about what im doing today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that for me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform today
3556299 i agree its unusual and strange timing and it tells me they were under stress and pressure
3556300 video game addiction also called video game overuse is a proposed form of psychological addiction composed of a compulsive use of computer and video games sometimes the addiction will manifest itself as part of excessive internet use most notable are massively multiplayer online role playing games mmorpgs and related to the also debated internet addiction disorder instances have been reported in which users play compulsively isolating themselves from social contact and focusing almost entirely on in game achievements rather than life events

3556304 why are the numbers adding up so sweetly for honda
3556305 honda sales are down but not as much as the industry
3556306 the civic and accord have strong images and now that transfers to the fit this is something that is particularly a result of their product portfolio they havent got a reliance on suvs or light trucks
3556307 the percentage of honda owners who trade for another honda are among the highest of any brand
3556308 one factor is their vehicles are high quality reliable and in general customer satisfaction is high they retain high resale values depreciate slowly and after three years a honda is worth more than other brands on the market
3556309 our flexible manufacturing system is allowing honda to shift production to meet consumer demand which prevents the company from being saddled with unused production capacity
3556310 the new small hybrid vehicle launching next year is likely the most significant addition as we will sell 200 000 worldwide per year with 100 000 units hitting north america
3556311 the uncertainties in the market have been quite profound in the past few weeks
3556312 we are adjusting our production to meet the rapidly changing needs of buyers and are confident these changes will provide the needed inventory as we move forward
3556313 honda has developed an image of being a technologically advanced company on the bleeding edge of power trains
3556314 theyre seen as environmentally friendly and relatively fuel efficient and right now thats helping them
3556315 honda has stated clearly that the company sees hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technology as the ultimate solution to sustainable clean transportation

3556340 we are now in a fight against the great russia
3556341 we are not operating in any way which may counter
3556342 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
3556343 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
3556344 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
3556345 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in possession of the georgian army would be like a red cloth the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
3556346 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
3556347 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
3556348 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy
3556349 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
3556350 we are now in a fight against the great russia
3556351 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
3556352 we need help from the un and from headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too

3556357 it is time for members to share in the savings that they have made
3556358 i sing like this it sounds worse than it is
3556359 i dont want to name names even though he probably deserves it but he fooled around
3556360 oh yeah and lied it was one of those things that everyone knew but me he was a good liar nobody would come out and tell me and he seemed perfect in every way
3556361 i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3556362 everybody wants to go to the olympics you know if you cant go as an athlete lets find another way
3556363 they are normal folks just like all of us their training room there was just like my training room at minot state or minot high those athletes have the same problems i didnt have to write any phy ed excuses that was probably the biggest difference
3556364 ive got 2 3 tvs going and computers going and i feel like im missing something all the time so its been difficult
3556365 its good to see them do well to be able to perform you know when i saw them they still hadnt gone through the trials yet a lot of them so to see them be able to attain that get to where they want to go and then do well has just been a joy
3556366 speaking to the camera what the hells going on i lost my show i lost my best friend i lost my girl im being shit on thats all shit on and you know what really pisses me off
3556367 crapping his pants at random and occasionally peeing on the rug
3556368 mamma meno male che le zanzare non sono grandi come elicotteri
3556369 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3556370 it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out
3556371 we must take the initiative to further develop higher yielding and climate resilient varieties of crop

3556380 if ignorance and poverty are responsible for the growth of extremist views in the islamic world someone needs ask to muslim students privileged enough and bright enough to attend some of the united kingdoms best universities why one in three of them endorses killing in the name of islam
3556381 significant numbers appear to hold beliefs which contravene democratic values
3556382 these results are deeply embarrassing for those who have said there is no extremism in british universities
3556383 dangerous increase in the spread of extremism in leading university campuses
3556384 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3556385 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3556386 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3556387 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3556388 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3556389 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3556390 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3556391 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom

3556401 home lending activity has declined sharply this calendar year although asb has experienced less of a fall in volumes than the market
3556402 our financial markets business and rural businesses continue to expand demonstrating asbs ability to take advantage of the economys underlying resilience and depth
3556403 as a result and despite the subdued market asb has increased its retail market share while also growing its business operations by 16 percent and its rural business by 31 percent
3556404 its simply because you have a time bomb from the past
3556405 farming is an industry and has to be treated as an industry
3556406 dont repeat our mistakes because you have a lot to clean up afterwards
3556407 over the next 10 years we are unlikely to survive financially
3556408 we can have the cleanest lakes in the world but we may not be able to afford a kilo of cheese or a pound of mince

3556415 our joint terrorism task force is involved in this simply because the victim here is from another country and it just kind of makes sense that our terrorism guys would take a look a look at this

3556434 i would move forward at the right time with the application for membership in nato by georgia
3556435 as you know through the nato membership that if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
3556436 we dont have i think right now the ability to intervene in any way except in a humanitarian economic way and do what we can to help the georgians
3556437 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country
3556438 gregoire does enter this rematch with advantages she is an incumbent in a democratic state in a likely democratic year but she also enters the race with a record how effectively either side is in explaining that record will determine the winner

3556442 in 1988 jenny hatch was placed in a michigan state mental institution for postpartum psychosis and drugged with haldol she stayed there for nine days until she could be transferred to a private hospital where she says she fought back with the staff on the medication issue for two weeks ultimately the private hospital sent jenny back to the state hospital and she fought medications for six more days telling everyone that she was breastfeeding a baby and could not take their drugs a judge then ordered 90 days additional incarceration in the hospital and forced meds she was sent back to a private hospital where they forced lithium stelazine and prozac when she became extremely suicidal on prozac the stelazine was withdrawn and the prozac was doubled ultimately after finally leaving the hospital jenny located a doctor who helped her wean off all medications over a six month period she also followed up by beginning a full body detoxification and then went on to have four more children fortunately with zero psychiatric pills to follow over the past 18 years jenny has advocated against forced drugging and her story has been publicized in books but for psychiatry old habits die hard in a recent blog entry jenny wrote about two women who had contacted her who had a history of psychosis and were told that if they ever had any more children they would be ordered to take antipsychotic drugs for two full years following the births in order to prevent ppp similarly new jersey s mothers law passed in 2006 has already resulted in mothers being forcibly taken to the hospital by police simply for mentioning to their doctors they were depressed or calling a ppd hotline force is certainly nothing new in psychiatry and in fact it has been central to the field for its entire history it seems that the drug pushers care only about maintaining income at all costs those caught by psychiatry cannot be called patients at all but rather victims
3556443 in this case it was not the police that were setting mr read up to entice mr read to come over here to have sex with what he thought was a 15 and a 17 year old girl
3556444 in my experience ive never encountered this where an estranged wife has been the one that set up this sting
3556445 he acknowledged that he came over based on the text messages that were sent to him to have sex with a 15 and 17 year old girl

3556448 it is certainly very damaging to the trees and very costly
3556449 at this particular point in time we dont have any incidents of it and were pretty pleased about that but weve got to be on our guard and weve got experts looking at this sort of situation
3556450 it can get around very easily and if its in claremont its likely it will spread
3556451 one of the big problems is there arent many elm trees left in the northern hemisphere because of dutch elm disease which is a totally different thing
3556452 so its places like australia that now have the remnant elm population so its pretty important to keep those elm trees going
3556453 im an american and we havent heard a single bit of this on u s news or even british news whats going on

3556456 the scheme itself has been really beneficial in allowing people to move stock in very difficult times out onto better feed to save hand feeding and its certainly been for the benefit and welfare of those livestock
3556457 they freshman really dont know what to expect in high school so were to ease that transition were hoping they make connections with students that are older that are going to help them through
3556458 the point of this is to make these freshmans trip into high school as easy as possible and also give them someone to come and talk to if they have problems during the school year
3556459 so were really here to give them anything they need
3556460 i really truly wanted to help these kids because i think its fun to get involved with things because i am very involved with clubs so i wanted them to get involved with clubs too

3556475 you watch it all the way to impact and i mean its very vivid its right there and personal so it does stay in peoples minds for a long time

3556480 caseys commitment to honestly addressing the right answer for both tempworks and my client is both an all too uncommon act and the kind of thinking that is the reflection of an excellent sales representative and company
3556481 i just got off the phone with tempworks sales person casey kraus and wanted to share my thoughts about that conversation with you i had talked to casey last week about a prospective medical staffing client that im working with i told him that id be talking to the client this week in preparation for evaluating some key alternatives casey called this morning to say that he had spent time with your development team for the medical version of your software and wanted to say that he and your team felt that tempworks really wasnt fully ready to be the provider that we needed to have and that they had also had a robust discussion of alternative vendors the strongest of which clearview was already at the top of our list ive been in the computer industry since the early 1980s starting as a sales representative and at one time was simultaneously on the apple and ibm national sales councils i co founded my consulting company in 1992 and weve been integrating solutions for clients involving a very long list of vendors since then which of course has involved us with countless sales reps caseys commitment to honestly addressing the right answer for both tempworks and my client is both an all too uncommon act and the kind of thinking that is the reflection of an excellent sales representative and company the actions that he and your staff took are the best character reference for a potential solution partner that could be wished for i will be talking to tempworks in the future for any clients that are a good fit and i will certainly recommend your company to others looking for staffing solutions
3556482 if you people know the staffing industry so well why on earth do you think we would be interested in your products
3556483 net broadband additions in the quarter were the fewest of any quarter in the seven years lrg has been tracking the industry
3556484 while the relative number of quarterly broadband adds has certainly peaked the decline in additions this quarter compared to the same period last year was exacerbated by verizon and at amp ts emphasis on selling higher speed fios and u verse bundled services often at the expense of the traditional dsl service
3556485 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace
3556486 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl cable modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country

3556491 ive just got off the phone with putin discussing south ossetia
3556492 saw no reason now or in the future why anyone would want to legalize abortion in kenya
3556493 affront to humanity of everybody and especially to the integrity of the human being
3556494 that a country is going mad if it starts killing its youth because in children the country has the seed for its future he said that if any government including president kibakis government were to enact such a law they would be acting against the people of kenya
3556495 slaves of foreign ideologies and policies that are devoid of christianity
3556496 i personally feel the continued denial of women to make free choice on their reproductive health life is wrong and the policy should be reformed to allow that freedom
3556497 we ought not to pull on the ends of the rope in which we have tied the knot of war because the more we pull the more the knot will be tied and a moment may come when the knot will be tied so tight that even he who tied it will not have the strength to untie it and then it will be necessary to cut the knot if there is no intention to tighten that knot and thereby doom the world to the catastrophe of nuclear war then let us not only relax the forces pulling on the end of the rope let us take measures to untie the knot

3556530 there isnt one group that is doing an outstanding job
3556531 were in a process and we keep installing things every day that will slow down eventually but we have a long way to go as a group
3556532 the defense has some linebackers who can make some plays
3556533 but the guys that went unsung were those guys with their hands in the dirt those guys are the ones that make plays for the linebackers and our linebackers realize that
3556534 pat played well and we moved him the last weeks of spring practice
3556535 he has had a good camp and were pushing him along with his teammates we have some options but were looking for him to take the job he isnt a finished product by any means but hes making progress on the field every day
3556536 he has really progressed and hes a smart kid and a great athlete
3556537 were really pleased with him he has a lot of ability but hes going to make a lot of mistakes as a young guy every day he is making plays and monday he was running with the ones and the twos
3556538 its a game of turnovers and its something we stress with our guys
3556539 we try to get that in our mind and that is a game changer and were trying to get that into their minds at camp
3556540 were going to get as many fast guys on the field as we can and those who can tackle in space
3556541 thats the game its a strike game at this level its not a collision game that you might see in a high school game where they just run into each other at this level you have to move your feet and be able to strike and those are the types of things that were trying to get across to our guys
3556542 when you spread the field you put an athlete in space they have to make tackles and thats the bottom line
3556543 i think people have adjusted to it you spread the field and when you get one on one with which is usually a good thing for the offense its a style of play and i think people have adjusted to it we consider ourselves successful and our goal is always to keep the opponent to 14 points or less
3556544 we have a long way to go with punting and thats why you have guys like gregg pugnetti here they are all upperclassmen and theyve done the routine
3556545 pat had a tremendous day stepping up avoiding the rush seeing the coverage and that was really good
3556546 when we get to where we dont have to put any on the stadium steps and they will do what we tell them to do then well be even better its just a form of discipline and we will have discipline in this program weve always had it we will continue to have it and i know we will have it in the future
3556547 at tight end fullback i think has a chance at fullback
3556548 as for running back we dont have a backup running back other than pat white at running back before im going to put someone in there that is going to fumble the football
3556549 the jury is still out but sands has done some nice things ricky kovatch these types of players that can run fast
3556550 d j thomas might be on special teams we have a tremendous amount of speed at west virginia and were very blessed so that would be a place for those guys to play

3556552 weve had two surgeries here in the last couple of days
3556553 toney baker has had surgery to clear out some things in his knee so hes on the shelf for a while until he comes back from that
3556554 clem johnson broke his jaw in the scrimmage so hes out for maybe the year
3556555 the way he was playing he would have been the starter at safety for us with the way he was going its a big loss for us right now
3556556 if he doesnt the thing with the jaw is you dont want to eat and you lose all that weight all that problem with trying to get substance in him hell start all over once it heals which is a lengthy process anyways
3556557 no life jackets and no rafts either youre going to drown or youre going to swim
3556558 and it makes us work extra hard to win another one
3556559 it put the school on map a little bit more
3556560 if you want to compete and get the quality athletes youre going to have to play in a stadium like that
3556561 its a great site one of the best stadiums ive played in
3556562 and once the band comes that makes it even better
3556563 i didnt know anything about it until juan pierre said he took all his bats and went on in
3556564 so i said well wed better get him out here manny was still getting on me about it today
3556565 i was sitting there and when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3556566 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3556567 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3556568 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3556569 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3556570 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3556571 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3556572 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3556573 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3556574 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think
3556575 jam s ser tan cool como ste o aqu l
3556576 jack look what you made me do why do you have to keep creeping up on me like that
3556577 y yes because youve gone and made me break your cup and get coffee everywhere
3556578 why is it every time we talk you always seem to end up with a raging hard on
3556579 oh you must know by now that i have the best sex drive in the universe plus with you i could last ages and i mean ages
3556580 ill have to prove it to you then wont i
3556581 it isnt an easy job but someone has to do it
3556582 they do that because theyre petrified of what might happen if they stop
3556583 youre supposed to tell us ahead of time before bringing visitors
3556584 hes going to be helping me out from now on so i thought id give him the tour
3556585 would you like a cup of tea before we start
3556586 just something hed been meaning to take care of for awhile
3556587 anyway im afraid itll just be me for a little while
3556588 you say that like we would be sorry to have you
3556589 well see you next month then if nothing comes up
3556590 if you talk to captain harkness at all while hes away tell him i say hello
3556591 and to hurry back before he gets homesick my mother always used to tell me time moves slower for people when theyre homesick
3556592 im sure the captain will figure out a way to pass the time
3556593 with all due respect sir this is a matter we can handle on our own
3556594 i appreciate your opinion detective and the case is still very much under your authority but by the laws set out to us by the highest authority we are under obligation to notify torchwood of any unusual activity
3556595 its a straightforward murder investigation surely torchwood has better things to do
3556596 a stabbing in a dark alley is straightforward a shooting in a bank is straightforward a man with his throat torn out with eyewitness accounts of a half man half rhino being the culprit is not straightforward
3556597 to be frank id rather give harkness a kick up the arse while wearing the pointy boots he so admired on me the last time

3556660 its like riding a bicycle its like i never left
3556661 this always happens in training camp feagles and i hook up for one of the greatest catches in practice
3556662 i pushed off a little bit are they going to call it on me probably not they didnt call it on me a few years back when i got shoved in the 2002 nfc wild card game in san francisco
3556663 it slipped out of my hand and i looked like a fool
3556664 a real boy a true story of autism early intervention and recovery
3556665 they pretty much plop you into the system take a number and this is what we offer
3556666 at that time i learned i was surrounded by a budding epidemic of autism it was everywhere and everyone was experiencing these terrible problems
3556667 they said they were going to change and do things differently and offer families early intervention hours
3556668 at that time they said just give us a chance well weve given them lots of chances and most people say its the same as it ever was
3556669 the calls were getting is no one can help my kid
3556670 keep in mind that the numbers of autistic children keep increasing even though the regional center may say we have more vendors when they started this process two years ago the number of children with autism was one in 250 compared to one in 150 children today they should be moving a lot faster
3556671 weve really been aggressively recruiting new behavioral vendors our target has been new behavioral vendors and reducing the time that families spend waiting
3556672 our data says that families are getting services faster today than they were getting it a year ago
3556673 you want to say praise the lord my kids are ok and you want to share that with those families you want to say your kids are alright your kids have passed
3556674 instead what the families do is say no my kid is not eligible
3556675 we hear that all the time the regional center told me my son no longer qualifies
3556676 the system is broken the parties need to get together at this point and come up with a resolution based on budgetary issues based on whats happening with the population because were in the middle of an epidemic
3556677 from milk toast internationalist to brave mccain like warrior in under 24 hours

3556679 the continued inability of the florida democrats to get their act together simply amazes me
3556680 one of the things we like about it is that while its superficially a howl of defiance you cant escape the fact that at the heart of this is an injured and self destructive spirit coping very badly but in the only way she knows how
3556681 this snp victory is not just a political earthquake it is off the richter scale it is an epic win and the tremors are being felt all the way to downing street
3556682 we have now demonstrated that there are no safe seats for the
3556683 evaporation of the liberal democrats as a meaningful force in scottish politics
3556684 my full focus is on taking people through these difficult times
3556685 its time for intervention intervention intervention by the labour party
3556686 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3556687 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3556688 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3556689 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3556690 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3556691 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3556692 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3556693 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3556694 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3556695 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3556696 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3556697 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3556698 if atlantis were to run through without the long hiatus that it normal takes does this mean that the season 5 dvd set might come out sooner as well
3556699 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3556700 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3556701 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3556702 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3556703 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3556704 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3556705 the governments scheme just wont work and i wasnt prepared to risk putting up fuel prices on the basis of overwhelming evidence
3556706 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3556707 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3556708 we are proceeding and the president is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3556709 morgan tsvangirai is the main opposition leader and any agreement that doesnt include his party will not work for the country it actually just complicates issues
3556710 not so long ago it seems we all knew a great uncle harold or auntie irene but sadly it seems these names could soon be lost forever
3556711 i dont know how i can ever say that i am sorry
3556712 i will be sorry for the rest of my life

3556716 we australia do stand to render any assistance if that will help in terms of ceasefire and also in terms of humanitarian assistance because we do have regrettably very many displaced people
3556717 we will give serious consideration to anything we can do on the humanitarian front
3556718 there are indications that georgia asked a range of nation states including australia to consider military assistance
3556719 australia indicated at officials levels that we werent interested in providing military assistance
3556720 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3556721 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3556722 the judge confirmed that ebay acted diligently when it received letters from loreal

3556730 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
3556731 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
3556732 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds

3556749 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3556750 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3556751 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3556752 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3556753 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3556754 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund

3556760 sfruttare una legge elettorale abominevole che ha cancellato i piccoli part iti
3556761 anche in tal caso ne siamo sicuri ma chi li fa questi sondaggi
3556762 che in questa nuova legge ci fosse un possibile conflitto di interesse non passato inosservato ma gli italiani si sentono troppo poveri per dargli attenzione

3556774 we are going to have one heck of a crisis on our hands
3556775 let the wind blow let the wind touch my face
3556776 uncertainty and volatility in global credit markets will continue to place upward pressure on funding costs
3556777 while these broad trends are clearly evident the duration and extent of the slowdown is more difficult to predict
3556778 there are clearly a number of negatives at work in the australian economy but it is important that we recognise there are potentially a number of positive influences
3556779 the balance of these opposing forces favours continued modest economic growth with credit growth not too far below the average of the past decade
3556780 the reason for the dates being longer than the normal six weeks set down for sex offences is because the matter involves a large number of pornographic images
3556781 there are 50 000 images estimated as a minimum which have to be examined and collated before the matter can proceed
3556782 i think itd have very little effect in the long run
3556783 it will be a very small effect but there will be an effect i think itll be delayed probably over two or three years whatever the final effect will be
3556784 the cost of this shift which was the main thing i was concerned about to the public hospitals would be about 360 million a year he said
3556785 in a system which costs i think last year it cost 26 billion itll be about 27 billion this year thats trivial
3556786 i do not consider 360 million a year to be a trivial amount and im sure most australians would agree mr hockey said in a statement
3556787 increased petrol and grocery prices are already putting pressure on australians 70 may seem like a small amount but for those on a fixed income it can make a real difference
3556788 we have done some work on the potential impact on premiums mr kilisch told the inquiry
3556789 id have to say its nowhere near the five per cent range that a number of people have talked about
3556790 it is considerably lower probably less than half that above expectations

3556822 we feel like a lot of the focus is on diablo ii but diablo i started it all and has a lot of really good stuff on the gameplay side and on the character side so people can expect to see characters from diablo i more characters from diablo ii and characters from some of the books were definitely going to bring a few of them in

3556831 the clay volumes are patterned after the justifiably celebrated loeb classical library for greek and latin small elegant books beautifully printed sparsely annotated and bilingual
3556832 indeed their raison d tre is to win for the sanskrit classics an audience outside india and certainly beyond the limited scholarly circles that have for the last two centuries or so studied these works produced critical editions and philological commentaries and sometimes also translated them into western languages almost invariably badly
3556833 the sheer awfulness of most earlier translations from sanskrit can help to explain the profound ignorance of sanskrit literature among western readers
3556834 a part of the trouble no doubt stems from the particular difficulties of sanskrit its forbidding morphology its fondness for extraordinarily lengthy nominal compounds its vast lexicon its daunting syntax and above all its somewhat exotic or in any case distinctive world of thought and imagination

3556846 i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3556847 they didnt even get the numbers right so i dont know if its about the money either

3556854 sobering news that todd and shonnah are presently experiencing significant friction in their relationship and are currently separated
3556855 its easy to become immune to stories about student debt but this increase is not just another rise some students are facing real financial hardship
3556856 even so the advantages of having a degree still outweigh the costs and the push survey shows that with high quality advice and information students can keep their debts while still enjoying the benefits of university
3556857 it is clear that many students are sleepwalking into financial crisis
3556858 as the credit crunch kicks in and with food and fuel costs set to rise even further we can expect more and more students to get into serious financial difficulty with many having to resort to taking out commercial loans or being bailed out by their parents
3556859 our research shows that prospective students need far more information advice and guidance about how to manage their own finances
3556860 when they leave home for the first time many students are unaware of the costs of everyday life and how debt can mount up
3556861 government universities schools and colleges all those involved must continue to ensure that all those who can benefit from going to university are not deterred from doing so by the prospect of debt

3556887 no question that theres a real danger that the group of people who went after churchill now feel empowered
3556888 i got the idea for this two years ago when i saw a kennel in california which had a ground pool shaped like a bone and had an enhanced playground area
3556889 but i didnt want the california look i wanted a natural wisconsin stream and pond i wanted many moving pools of varying depths some dogs only want to get their feet wet but dont want to be submerged
3556890 a portugese water dog who was just 11 weeks old just jumped in the pond and started swimming
3556891 he had a nice eye for natural placement of rock
3556892 but it turned out to be a lot harder than he imagined in minocqua the soil is sandy in mount horeb its heavy clay
3556893 i need protection from scorching heat mist and all of that and so do the dogs she said
3556894 because of zoning im only allowed to have 10 dogs at 55 per night all inclusive 3 an hour for day care and i wanted 20 to make this work this business is feast or famine at thanksgiving and christmas im always full but may and september are dead so when things are good i set aside money for the famines
3556895 go out to eat whats that i work 17 hour shifts and ive been doing this 25 years this is what we do
3556896 colleagues took me to a dog show and something came alive in me
3556897 thats part of the reward for me too she said
3556898 i get to live in a beautiful place and i appreciate the tranquilizing effects of water as much as the dogs do
3556899 unfortunately that bony piece is attached to the ligament and the tendon
3556900 you never want to say you cant but i would say that its highly unlikely that youre going to see tom gordon pitch this year for us
3556901 the good thing is right now that he feels really good its not really uncommon these are certain things that happen sometimes to players when you think about the bone pulling off i know that sounds kind of odd but that actually happens sometimes its not the best case scenario it certainly isnt the norm but at the same time the hard part about this is that piece of bone is not that big so its not like you can just take a screw and fix it like a fracture and you cant take a little pin and just put it in there because you dont know if youre going to get stability out of it so the best thing to do might be just to let it kind of scar back over and see what happens to it
3556902 people need to be wary as it may cost them a lot more to get faults rectified
3556903 it is often the case that when these contractors have left the area they cannot be contacted again
3556904 most of them are unregistered and have no fixed land line or office contact point
3556905 they use mobile phone contact numbers while working in the area
3556906 keen to take action against these operators where they can
3556907 if these operators do not get business in an area they will have to give up
3556908 we have produced some pointers aimed at raising awareness of the possible pitfalls associated with the engaging transient contractors
3556909 i would urge consumers not to be talked into engaging their services and to contact the agency immediately if they come across these rogue traders
3556910 but the fact is that 95 per cent of our malt is purchased by guinness and i am telling them now that unless we get the same price as last year 205 per tonne farmers will not grow the crop next year
3556911 the price on offer to growers of 165 a tonne is jeopardising future supplies given the scale of the increase in their input costs growers must maintain a margin or they will not produce a crop
3556912 if guinness want to keep the irish harp on the pint of stout they will have to pay a realistic price to irish malting barley growers and diageo and greencore malt cannot continue to take growers for granted
3556913 every year guinness put 2 3 per cent on the price of a pint last march they added an additional 3 5 per cent to the pint and before the year is out they are adding a further 2 per cent
3556914 yet their main supplier greencore malt is cutting the price paid to malting barley growers by over 20 per cent
3556915 now it is putting malting barley growers out of business
3556916 we are not being greedy we are facing rising costs of over 40 per tonne on fertiliser and oil costs we are seeking last years price but i believe if we do not get it then no farmer will plant the crop next year
3556917 diageo does not buy malting barley from growers but purchases finished malt from malting companies it has no role whatsoever in negotiations regarding the price of malting barley these are a matter for growers and malting companies
3556918 the ifa claims that diageo is increasing the price of the pint by 8 cent this is untrue diageo confirmed two weeks ago that the company is considering a 2 per cent increase in wholesale prices due to cost increases
3556919 we feel the number we are looking for is a reasonable number we have brought it back to its minimum level to ensure that the scale and quality of service that we can deliver on moving to the new department is a safe service
3556920 i remember the first case in england where an irish person received an award for being the butt of all the paddy jokes and there were those who were asking as to why he could not take a joke but it is the way it is done and the impact it has
3556921 i have come across prejudice where frankly racist statements have been expressed but ive come across it much more in irish bars in the us where there is genuine antipathy towards the british
3556922 this event had a huge impact on the citizens of a much smaller galway at the time and indeed of the people of ireland indeed the fact that we are here today 50 years after this tragedy speaks volumes about the enduring influence of the klm air crash on the people of galway
3556923 galway experienced unforgettable scenes as the bodies of the victims were brought into the city and buried in this cemetery this burial place will forever be remembered by the people of galway for such a great tragedy and such a great loss of life
3556924 i must make mention of the wonderful assistance and co operation so freely given by the people of galway in this whole tragic affair
3556925 their generous effort has made the work of the accident crew so very much easier and it is difficult to mention the names of individuals from the town where virtually everyone was worthy of mention
3556926 a calamity that lives on in the daily lives of the families of the victims
3556927 weve engaged advice which confers our entitlement to represent dentists and this has been confirmed at european commission level
3556928 i would urge the hse and the irish dental association to discuss this matter and to come to a resolution which ensures that patients do not suffer

3556932 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3556933 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3556934 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3556935 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3556936 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3556937 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3556938 the governments scheme just wont work and i wasnt prepared to risk putting up fuel prices on the basis of overwhelming evidence
3556939 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3556940 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3556941 we are proceeding and the president is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3556942 we australia do stand to render any assistance if that will help in terms of ceasefire and also in terms of humanitarian assistance because we do have regrettably very many displaced people
3556943 we will give serious consideration to anything we can do on the humanitarian front
3556944 there are indications that georgia asked a range of nation states including australia to consider military assistance
3556945 he pees up in the air in a big arc so it goes in the coin slot and out the hole where people collect their tickets
3556946 i would move forward at the right time with the application for membership in nato by georgia
3556947 as you know through the nato membership that if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
3556948 we dont have i think right now the ability to intervene in any way except in a humanitarian economic way and do what we can to help the georgians
3556949 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country

3556965 in some moral matters the use of reason allows for a legitimate diversity in our prudential judgments
3556966 the morality of such questions lies not in what is done the moral object but in the motive and circumstances therefore because these prudential judgments do not involve a direct choice of something evil and take into consideration various goods it is possible for catholic voters to arrive at different even opposing judgments
3556967 a correct conscience recognizes that there are some choices that always involve doing evil and which can never be done even as a means to a good end
3556968 such acts are judged to be intrinsically evil that is evil in and of themselves regardless of our motives or the circumstances they constitute an attack against innocent human life as well as marriage and family
3556969 in light of the above it is a correct judgment of conscience that we would commit moral evil if we were to vote for a candidate who takes a permissive stand on those actions that are intrinsically evil when there is a morally acceptable alternative
3556970 what are we do do though when there is no such alternative because we have a moral obligation to vote deciding not to vote at all is not ordinarily an acceptable solution to this dilemma
3556971 so when there is no choice of a candidate that avoids supporting intrinsically evil actions especially elective abortion we should vote in such a way as to allow the least harm to innocent human life and dignity
3556972 we would not be acting immorally therefore if we were to vote for a candidate who is not totally acceptable in order to defeat one who is not totally acceptable in order to defeat one who poses an even greater threat to human life and dignity

3556988 lieber herr harris da die spielentwickler leider nur noch langweilige spiele ohne innovation oder spiele mit nur sehr kurzem spielspa rausbringen sehe ich kein grund f r so etwas einen solch hoch angesetzten preis hinzulegen desweiteren scheint man nur auf grafik und aussehen zu setzen story und gameplay gehen dabei leider nur v llig fl ten mal ganz davon abzusehen das verkaufsversionen zu meist noch einige bugs enthalten

3556990 lately ive been really interested in fashion and i like to make binders and slideshows of high fashion modeling and designs
3556991 i just kind of wanted to document my outfits and it was just a random thing that wasnt in relation to anything
3556992 parents have no idea what their kids are doing online
3556993 i share a lot of information to people i guess more than i probably should but i just felt that i didnt want the people who are very close to me reading it because i guess im embarrassed about my writing sometimes
3556994 i believe its a great outlet if youre older and more mature but you are opening yourself up to the world and you have to be prepared for that
3556995 i personally feel that its not safe to have a child whos 12 or 13 have a blog and i wouldnt want my kids to do that
3556996 are you posing in a more provocative way is it how you want to be remembered when your next boyfriend sees it or your future mother in law sees it or your tuition scholarship persons going to review you for dartmouth
3556997 i felt like i had to protect the identity of people who dont know or arent aware of the blog
3556998 i may have known but to me it was a kind of a non thing to know
3556999 i didnt look at it i wasnt terribly interested in seeing it
3557000 anyone who actually believes she is 12 is an absolute idoit sic
3557001 she slept in the bed with us that night to get back to sleep
3557002 she woke up and again woke us up and said and this is really heartbreaking i just woke up crying and i dont even know why im crying
3557003 whoever may comment and whatever feedback you may get girls are very impressionable especially girls in this age that were talking about
3557004 i have a lot of confidence in her and in most kids if not all kids that they can figure it out if they have good guidance and caring people working with them
3557005 id much rather have her decide to stop if shes going to stop than to tell her to stop
3557006 it would have been fine with me if she didnt pick it back up again but i think it was healthy that she did i think it would have been a bad thing for this to be the reason to stop blogging shell grow out of it maybe maybe not
3557007 i would absolutely think that any parent who would comment on a blog without their kids permission is looking for serious trouble
3557008 so what you need to do is turn to your kids and say what are you doing online
3557009 not as an accusation but as a real question you have an interest in what are you doing will you show me you have to have the talk you have to sit down
3557010 if somebody else is in the picture unless they say its ok to use them take them out of it or shadow them a little bit

3557016 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
3557017 i didnt know anything about it until juan pierre said he took all his bats and went on in
3557018 so i said well wed better get him out here manny was still getting on me about it today
3557019 i was sitting there and when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3557020 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3557021 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3557022 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3557023 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3557024 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3557025 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3557026 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3557027 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3557028 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think
3557029 there was a lot of stuff that happened in cleveland there were stories about him you know what if i told all the stories about him and the funny things that happened you and i might be sitting here and laughing this time tomorrow thats who he is when i used to talk hitting with him id say youve got to be tension free and actually manny is tension free in life thats something that comes natural for him

3557047 we could become the absolute world leader at about number eight and that would be a wonderful place to be at this is a real solution with serious players and proven technology
3557048 subject to conditions remaining favourable we expect to achieve increased earnings in 2009
3557049 we didnt know when it would work and were quite surprised at how well it will work
3557050 we will make sure there is a free flow of goods people and expression during the 2010 olympic games
3557051 i think we are already seeing some improvements i think we will see more
3557052 i think people who come from outside vancouver will see communities striving to be even better there will be significant improvements
3557053 i believe we are making some significant steps to improve the lives of those in the downtown eastside
3557054 i dont see this as an area of problems i see this as an area of possibilities
3557055 ive got three domestic reporters who are asking all the questions
3557056 were dealing with it because we think its important to make it a healthier community to live in were dealing with literally thousands of citizens who have significant challenges in their lives
3557057 its not something that can be done quickly if it was it would have been solved across the country and around the world
3557058 just as beijing has rolled out the red carpet so will vancouver in 2010 welcome the world
3557059 we expect to be opening the doors in a way that will be unprecedented in our history

3557064 but the real signal came out with some of the northerly species that are more common in canada and the northern part of the u s their southern range boundaries are actually moving northward as well at a much faster clip
3557065 there are a wide spectrum of changes that are occurring and those changes are occurring in a relatively short amount of time were not talking centuries were talking decades
3557066 new york citizens need to recognize that these changes are occurring
3557067 whether they are good or bad whether they should be addressed whether we should adapt to them whether we should try to mitigate some of this those are questions that really rightfully belong in the political arena
3557068 when all is said and done we wouldnt be surprised to see very little global oil demand growth over this year and next

3557117 ipnetzone has come to rely on linmin for both the provisioning and imaging of servers in our various co location sites
3557118 linmins new api will enable us to offer even better responsiveness to customer requests for additional and or differently configured linux and windows servers
3557119 having a best of breed provisioning and imaging solution was a great starting point but being a standalone product didnt maximize the potential of linmin bare metal provisioning now with the new linmin api customers can optimize it resources physical virtual and human around business processes not the other way around
3557120 linmins ability to install applications and management agents during the provisioning process is even more valuable with the api bringing a closed loop process to customers existing environments automatically select an appropriate and available physical or virtual system invoke the linmin api and after the system is provisioned these agents identify themselves to their respective management monitoring policy enforcement availability compliance and other applications that then take control of the system this is it application integration at its best

3557203 then why not fault that to religion where morality stems from in the first place
3557204 probably because religion was a good idea the rules that came with it however was a very bad one

3557210 its definitely a huge loss for us on the offense
3557211 trintons a great player and a great person but weve still got 14 games to play hopefully were a resilient team we understand its a loss but weve suffered losses in the past when thomas brown went down last year knowshon moreno stepped up there are instances across the board where people go down and other people step up its the sign of a good team hopefully we can do that

3557292 what keeps our retinas from disintegrating each night as glutamate continues to be released is unknown but growing evidence suggests our molecular protector may be zinc
3557293 not much is known about the relationship between zinc and the eye

3557295 this is doubly surprising since although glutamate is a major signaling molecule in the retina and throughout the central nervous system it is also a potent cytotoxin that in large doses can kill nearby cells

3557324 in an effort to compete with movie piracy in russia the movie industry chose to create a new format for dvd releases that could be produced more quickly and less expensively than traditional dvd releases r5 releases differ from normal releases in that they lack both the image post processing and special features that are common on dvd releases this allows the film to be released for sale at the same time that dvd screeners are released

3557351 tanggal 14 agustus 1945 pukul 15 00 beberapa pemuda radikal berkumpul di sebuah pekarangan yang banyak pohon pisangnya tidak jauh dari lapangan terbang kemayoran mereka adalah chaerul saleh asmara hadi am hanafi sudiro dan sk trimurti kami menantikan kedatangan bung karno dan bung hatta dari saigon kami pikir keduanya diiming imingi jepang dengan janji kemerdekaan kelak di kemudian hari janji yang kami anggap menghina bangsa indonesia kami para pemuda tidak mau kemerdekaan hadiah
3557352 kita tidak bisa bicara soal itu di sini lihat itu kempetai mengawasi kita
3557353 kalau bung karno tidak mau mengumumkan proklamasi esok akan terjadi pertumpahan darah di jakarta
3557354 saya tidak akan membacakan teks proklamasi kalau bung hatta tidak ada jika mas muwardi tidak mau menunggu silakan baca sendiri
3557355 sewaktu kami memasuki ruang duduk tampak jelas kelegaan sukarno atas kedatangan kami kehadiran kami rupanya memberi pengaruh yang menenangkan karena sukarno telah menguasai kembali gejolak emosinya sukarno menceritakan kepada kami bahwa para pemuda tersebut telah datang untuk mendesaknya mengambil tindakan dalam hubungan proklamasi kemerdekaan
3557356 jika kalian siap menyatakan sendiri kemerdekaan cobalah saya ingin tahu kesanggupan kalian
3557357 jika ini pendapat bung silahkan kami para pemuda tidak dapat membenarkan penundaan proklamasi lewat siang atau besok kami para pemuda akan mengambil tindakan tindakan dan membuktikan kesanggupan kami seperti bung kehendaki
3557358 sesuatu yang tidak mungkin karena stasiun radio masih dikuasai balatentara jepang yang memiliki persenjataan lengkap
3557359 jika bung karno tidak mengeluarkan pengumuman malam ini juga akan berakibat terjadinya suatu pertumpahan darah dan pembunuhan besar besaran esok hari
3557360 ini batang leherku seretlah saya ke pojok itu dan potonglah leherku malam ini juga kamu tidak usah menunggu esok hari
3557361 saya secara diam diam setuju dengan pendapatnya karena bagaimana mungkin kami meninggalkan para anggota panitia persiapan kemerdekaan yang akan bersidang hari esoknya di pejambon kini gedung pancasila
3557362 jepang adalah masa silam kita sekarang harus menghadapi belanda yang akan berusaha untuk kembali menjadi tuan di negeri kita ini jika saudara tidak setuju dengan apa yang telah saya katakan dan mengira bahwa saudara telah siap dan sanggup untuk memproklamasikan mengapa saudara tidak memproklamasikan kemerdekaan itu sendiri mengapa meminta sukarno untuk melakukan hal itu
3557363 penculikan ini karena khawatir bahwa keduanya akan dibunuh oleh tentara jepang dan paling sedikit digunakan sebagai sandera
3557364 agar nilai sejarahnya lebih berbobot pembangunan kembali rumah bung karno sebaiknya dilakukan ditempat semula
3557365 bahkan saya telah menyiapkan dananya tapi pak harto tidak setuju karena akan membangun patung proklamator
3557366 kita kobarkan revolusi yang meluas malam ini juga dengan satu isyarat bung karno seluruh jakarta akan terbakar ribuan pasukan bersenjata sudah siap sedia menyingkirkan seluruh tentara jepang
3557367 dia coba menggertakku revolusi berada ditangan kami sekarang dan kami memerintah bung kalau bung tidak memulai revolusi malam ini lalu
3557368 saya tidak mau membacakan teks proklamasi bila hatta tidak ada jikalau mas muwardi tidak mau menunggu silahkan baca sendiri
3557369 apakah saudara sudah siap betul betul melancarkan suatu revolusi kalau gagal bagaimana bukankah rakyat nanti menjadi korban
3557370 biar digorok leherku aku tidak akan memproklamirkan kemerdekaan malam ini besok atau kapan saja kamu jangan coba coba mengancam aku ya

3557375 at least theyre not dropping bombs on us anymore everyday it was getting worse and worse except today today she said it was ok
3557376 i was very angry very angry with what russia has done to my country it was a full scale invasion there was no ethnic conflict in that region at all it was a made up reason by russian they just wanted a reason to control us to have them influence on us
3557377 russia waiting for this moment thats my opinion trying to do anything to get georgia trapped and dragging in this conflict

3557401 danny gave it to me just before the both of you left for california you know when you reported to colonel doolittle after he died well you and i never really saw much of each other and i found out that danny left the car to me in a will
3557402 it helped me get around easier but you can have it if you want
3557403 danny wanted you to have the car you should keep it
3557404 but i wouldnt mind using it every now and then at least until im sent overseas
3557405 hmmm overseas i forgot about that but since youre here
3557406 i would have rented a smaller house but the girls decided they had enough of the base and moved in with me
3557407 yet somehow i got the feeling that your mind was on something else
3557408 you just passed the road that leads to my house even after i told you to turn
3557409 would like to come in for a cup of coffee or another drink
3557410 i realize you had expected to marry danny but with him gone and you expecting a baby well ill be more than happy to take his place
3557411 danny was like a brother to me he would have wanted me to take care of you and the baby and i swear evelyn ill do just that
3557412 evelyn wait a minute i just asked you to marry me
3557413 talk to me dammit i just proposed to you and now youre acting as if i had sullied your name
3557414 how about north and south under the federal republic of cyprus

3557416 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3557417 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3557418 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3557419 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3557420 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3557421 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3557422 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3557423 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3557424 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3557425 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3557426 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3557427 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3557428 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3557429 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3557430 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3557431 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3557432 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3557433 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3557434 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3557435 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3557436 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3557437 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3557438 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3557439 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3557440 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3557441 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3557442 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

3557452 wichtig wird sein dass ich von anfang an hochkonzentriert zu werke gehe
3557453 ich muss mir aber nicht den kopf zerbrechen wenn alles passt kann ich sie schlagen das wei ich
3557454 ich war sehr entt uscht dass ich keine faire chance bekommen habe
3557455 es ist hart f r etwas kritisiert zu werden das am nicht ndern kann ich kann trainieren wachsen kann ich aber nicht

3557463 just one ounce of processed meat per day increases your risk of stomach cancer by 15 percent to 38 percent
3557464 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3557465 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3557466 going after your opponent for being of the world seemed a bit jarring a bit odd
3557467 their campaign really seems pretty out of touch with what the american people want to see and hear during the olympics
3557468 theyre using a gigantic stage to make their national case against obama
3557469 it doesnt seem to be causing any uproar they may have guessed right
3557470 focused on ensuring that voters have the best information possible to make an informed decision on election day
3557471 i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3557472 unlike barack obama harley owners appreciate open roads and open markets
3557473 she was examined for abdominal pain related to gunshot wounds
3557474 this continues to show the insurgents are desperate to destabilize afghanistan with no regard for the lives of innocent afghans
3557475 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3557476 if it means staying in this country for 6 months i will do that
3557477 he pees up in the air in a big arc so it goes in the coin slot and out the hole where people collect their tickets
3557478 i recently received a page from the washington post june 19 2008 page a9
3557479 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3557480 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3557481 the cabin is one of 200 artifacts that were offered to us through the fbi the unabomber is an interesting case of the combative sometimes cooperative relationship of the press with the fbi
3557482 the cabin had a definite media hook since the artifact was provided by the fbi and we think it is a dramatic way of retelling the story to visitors we intend to keep it as part of the exhibit
3557483 do you have a no farting rule in the clean room
3557484 unfortunately we were sent to the boxing ring with our hands tied behind us
3557485 and in a place like darfur where there are no roads you need flexibility and helicopters are really another value added to the operation
3557486 if we dont we may be short of it a little bit but we are working day and night both at the mission and with the headquarters and with friends of unamid to make sure we hit that 80 percent by december this year
3557487 as much as we have given the eastern people their right to own land we will soon ensure that northern people would be free to do likewise
3557488 it is vital the cica understands that women are not responsible for mens criminality because they have a drink or for any other reason
3557489 nobody would suggest that if someones wallet was stolen after having a drink then their compensation should be reduced
3557490 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable due to alcohol consumption
3557491 as i understand it the cica have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases that they believe may also have had the guidelines misinterpreted and review them without the victims themselves having to go back and ask for that review
3557492 if an applicant accepts our decision then that case is finalised and closed
3557493 if they wish to ask for a review they must do this themselves in writing
3557494 contributed to the circumstances which gave rise to the injury
3557495 old prejudices like if a woman is wearing a short skirt or acting in a certain way are still operational
3557496 by reducing compensation because a woman has been drinking the cica is operating under those old prejudices
3557497 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3557498 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption this supports our view that a victim of rape is not in anyway culpable due to alcohol consumption
3557499 a victim of rape should not have any compensation reduced because of their drinking i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases

3557506 the possibility of this has been known for a little while but this is the first time weve seen it done
3557507 users downloading from p2p networks need to exercise caution anyway but should also be sensitive to pop ups appearing upon playing a downloaded video or audio stream
3557508 i never allow programs to choose which codecs i use to play back media
3557509 i research it and get the codec bundles off of sites i know to be trustworthy and even then i still scan them and check to make sure they are what they are i honestly dont feel that this malware has a very good chance of spreading fast
3557510 i think that outside a minority of users who really know about all the dangers implied with internet use the vast majority of people have no idea that such a codec download could lead to a trojan infection
3557511 sandeman has really been coming on strong and competing extremely hard the last four practices or so we have a lot of good competition at the x position with derrell johnson koulianos and colin at this stage brodell is a veteran guy and knows what hes doing he made the catches that came his way today which he needs to do the tight ends allen reisner showed up and made some big plays as well today chaney did a nice job and hes starting to play full speed some of the young guys who are making plays at the wide receiver position steve staggs had a nice play at the end of practice ben evans those guys have all been pushing for their chances to show what they can do when the ball is thrown their way

3557520 dabei handelte es sich polizeilichen erkenntnissen zufolge um eine veranstaltung mit bis zu tausend gesch tzten teilnehmern des rechten spektrums die aus dem gesamten bundesgebiet erwartet wurden

3557526 there is such a thing as expertise when it comes to complex emotions or emotional skills such as the one of cultivating benevolence
3557527 that raises the possibility that you can train someone to cultivate this positive emotion
3557528 the way you are going to understand the emotion of someone else is by somehow simulating experiencing the emotion it makes sense that we found some activation of the brain region which is critical for the experience of an emotion
3557529 sometimes you can understand someone but not necessarily experience the emotion it makes sense that you get activation in a brain region that is more contemplative
3557530 another question is whether this form of mental training and empathy can have an impact for education we dont know yet

3557534 now its time for the state legislature to get to work
3557535 we cant be overcritical of american publishers for cowering under terrorist threats after all the guardian like every other british newspaper lacked the gumption to publish the danish cartoons but all who care about free speech have a duty to make this sort of censorship counterproductive random house should pay this author substantial compensation and the book should be placed on a website so everyone can read it
3557536 might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
3557537 we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house inc booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book
3557538 frankly im more afraid of global warming than of terrorist attacks
3557539 i did expect my book would be controversial just because im a pink woman writing about a culture that was not my own and a religion that is not my own but my aim was not to provoke it was to portray the difficulty of being a woman in that era and to portray this wonderful heroine who overcame obstacles to become a prominent figure in islam
3557540 i pulled myself up to my windowsill and peered into the stars imagining they were the one thousand and one eyes of al lah when he looked at me what did he see inferiority a shrunken soul a light that shone more feebly than that of a man or did he see what i felt a bright burning like the bush hed inhabited the day hed revealed himself to moses

3557542 my portrayal of muhammad is extremely respectful and of the origins of islam is very accurate and respectful
3557543 muhammad says in the koran that he was a mortal i assume he did all the things a man does he had 12 wives im sure he had sex with them

3557579 my main goal was not track but college i wanted to be the first in my family to graduate college

3557603 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3557604 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3557605 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3557606 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3557607 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3557608 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3557612 a guy makes a comment to roy about taking plays off which is the truth you guys know it he knows it detroit lions know it everybody lets him get away with it and i get kicked out
3557613 can you guys believe though seriously that they kicked a fan our for just telling roy to stop taking plays off guys that is the truth the truth hurts
3557614 if i had a problem i would have climbed over the fence and climbed up the stands
3557615 i didnt have a problem with the dude i like to interact with the fans he had a little problem with me i didnt have a problem with him i just wanted to hear his opinion so it wasnt a big deal to me im sorry the guy got kicked out but he did that not me
3557616 after many outstanding experiences weve had with thousands of fans who have been guests at training camp a situation occurred during todays morning session involving one fan who behaved in an unruly and disruptive manner following complaints from fans in the immediate area members of our security team discussed the situation with the gentleman and explained the appropriate expected fan code of conduct as set forth by our organization and the nfl the gentleman declined to modify his behavior and was asked to leave the morning session

3557704 all of australias major banks increased interest rates by around 0 5 per cent on top of official rate rises in the past 12 months to protect themselves against an increase in their own borrowing costs
3557705 but after announcing a profit of 4 79 billion we have to ask if the bank is putting the needs of a relatively small number of investors over the thousands of families struggling to meet loan repayments and put food on the table
3557706 but with profits up and the banks own costs coming down it is time to wind back some of those rises and commit to passing on any cut made by the reserve bank of australia in september

3557749 youve got to be willing to put in the work
3557750 im saving about 200 a month on gas i only need to fill up on diesel about once a month
3557751 im an illiterate who has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that i can get
3557752 you dont necessarily have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country john mccain is aware of the internet
3557753 basically john is a technological troglodyte and proud of it
3557754 broadband will soon be an indispensable communication technology affecting the way we learn the way we work and the way we communicate
3557755 however at the dawn of this digital age those who could benefit the most from this economically empowering technology are also those most likely to be left without access because of where they live or how much money they make
3557756 the scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength
3557757 what concerns me is that mccain will do as george bush did which is to make technology an issue related to how he raises money to run the government or to fund campaigns and not as an independent issue that is important to grow america
3557758 technology for the bush administration is a total non issue even though that was the thing that drove most growth in 1992 to 2003 and the reason i think hed be led to that is because hes a guy who doesnt understand anything about technology in the first place
3557759 i think that the people who determine his tech policies like former fcc chairman michael powell and a few others who were his top advisors will talk as bush has talked about getting advanced telecommunications services to all americans
3557760 but mainly their model is to allow the industry to determine what all this means which is the danger
3557761 far too little oversight to the good things in the 1996 telecommunications act
3557762 making sure there were equal opportunities to participate in the industry afforded to women and minorities and small businesses
3557763 there was a rush to essentially allow industry players to get into each others businesses and consolidate in the industry
3557764 their bush and mccain belief is that government should just get out of the way and let the private sector do it clearly in the financial markets the private sector has done a horrible job
3557765 a woman entered my apartment who looked exactly like my wife
3557766 why should i believe just by fiat that this woman was rema when that ran contrary to the phenomenology
3557767 sense of concordance and meaning of a pattern both inscrutable and yet at some almost cellular level detected
3557768 these songs were designed like the fear factory songs that raymond and i always wrote however weve been able to push the boundaries and go out of that context while remaining heavy
3557769 christian and ray have been writing together for many years so the music does have a lot of fear factory elements
3557770 however weve been open to trying different things it basically fuses what i have been doing vocally in threat signal with driving fear factory rhythms along with some of our own experimentation the idea behind the project is to be heavy but maintain melody at the same time
3557771 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3557772 people are interested in being an active participant in their own entertainment so rather than just being satisfied with just watching television or going to a movie on a saturday afternoon or even going to a baseball game or whatever people what to be a part of something they want to help create something cool
3557773 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3557774 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3557775 a deal has been reached between president mugabe and mdc mutambara faction which has been signed in the presence of president mbeki
3557776 negotiators are meeting right now trying to find the technical details of how the new government will be structured
3557777 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3557778 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3557779 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3557780 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3557781 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3557782 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3557783 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3557784 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3557785 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3557786 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3557787 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3557788 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3557789 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3557798 muir weaves commentary thoughtful analyses and humor into a true art form
3557799 muirs genius lies in his giving context to the films
3557800 as a critic muir is acute in his analysis and as a writer he is easy to read
3557801 well grounded in the love and minutiae of sci fi and fantasy adventure
3557802 john kenneth muirs books for mcfarland are distinctive because of their authority and effective research
3557803 he really scrapes beneath the surface of the film and looks for the subtext every nuance is analysed

3557810 300 mg or more of aspirin a day for about 5 years is effective in primary prevention of colorectal cancer in randomised controlled trials with a latency of about 10 years
3557811 although the evidence from two rcts suggests that calcium supplementation might contribute to a moderate degree to the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps this does not constitute sufficient evidence to recommend the general use of calcium supplements to prevent colorectal cancer

3557820 realistic about the ability of cities such as manchester leeds and newcastle to regenerate struggling nearby towns such as liverpool bradford and sunderland
3557821 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3557822 its appalling that cancer patients in england are forced to cut back on basic necessities like food to pay for their urgently needed medication people must never be forced to choose between food or medication the government must act now
3557823 patients should be allowed to focus on getting better instead of worrying how theyre going to find money for prescriptions

3557846 tao is an extraordinary restaurant and richard and his partners had a fantastic concept and a brilliant creation it was fantastic to be an integral part of a very winning team but now ive got a lot of other opportunities to explore first though i need a vacation in cabo go see mum and dad and enjoy my first love first hand the superbowl before i select something else new and challenging in vegas im definitely staying here in the most exciting dining destination in the world though
3557847 we are very pleased to have mark on board at tao asian bistro we look forward to the new additions that mark will bring based on his previous experiences in some of the countrys best restaurants current chef de cuisine josh thomsen has moved on to pursue other professional opportunities and we wish him the best in those future endeavors

3557849 its a sad thing in this business that diligent dedicated disciplined journeyman chefs can work away really hard putting in incredible hours to build a business and then when its at the top the owners bring in a star name to give it an extra boost when they cant take it any further its a classic situation in the restaurant business and thats probably exactly what happened here josh was great and did a fantastic job but now they wanted some extra glitz and glamor with a tv name attached to it
3557850 i have the pleasure and satisfaction of knowing our incredible kitchen staff was the best in the business and some nights turned out an amazing 1 200 top notch gourmet dinners at the same time as hosting another 1 000 simultaneously for cocktails there arent many restaurants that could claim that anywhere in the world so i depart on the best of terms knowing we achieved everything and more that we set out to do

3557860 the main idea behind nobhill was to create a restaurant that would reflect the type of dining opportunities found throughout san francisco in one comfortable neighborhood style location
3557861 the menu features a diverse selection of the type of food and fresh products most closely associated with dining in san francisco at least 80 percent of the product comes from growers and producers located in the bay area it is the first time some of the items have been available outside of northern california
3557862 it is to be a humble space this isnt a fusion of anything there is no show there is no las vegas in the room nothing shouting design

3557914 the one humbles itself in order to attain the other attains because it is humble if the great kingdom has no further desire than to bring men together and to nourish them the small kingdom will have no further desire than to enter the service of the other but in order that both may have their desire the great one must learn humility

3557919 the recycling program seems to be meeting our expectations so far for the first four weeks
3557920 in one month of the program weve collected 655 tons of recyclables so that meets up with our initial estimates which would be between 7 000 10 000 tons a year
3557921 its kind of a pay me now pay me later scenario
3557922 if we dont do things now to reduce the amount of garbage going into the landfill then it will come back to us in the future
3557923 i think through some additional education to those people who are not recycling i think we can increase those numbers

3558024 lately ive been really interested in fashion and i like to make binders and slideshows of high fashion modeling and designs
3558025 i just kind of wanted to document my outfits and it was just a random thing that wasnt in relation to anything
3558026 parents have no idea what their kids are doing online
3558027 i share a lot of information to people i guess more than i probably should but i just felt that i didnt want the people who are very close to me reading it because i guess im embarrassed about my writing sometimes
3558028 i believe its a great outlet if youre older and more mature but you are opening yourself up to the world and you have to be prepared for that
3558029 i personally feel that its not safe to have a child whos 12 or 13 have a blog and i wouldnt want my kids to do that
3558030 are you posing in a more provocative way is it how you want to be remembered when your next boyfriend sees it or your future mother in law sees it or your tuition scholarship persons going to review you for dartmouth
3558031 i felt like i had to protect the identity of people who dont know or arent aware of the blog
3558032 i may have known but to me it was a kind of a non thing to know
3558033 i didnt look at it i wasnt terribly interested in seeing it
3558034 anyone who actually believes she is 12 is an absolute idoit sic
3558035 she slept in the bed with us that night to get back to sleep
3558036 she woke up and again woke us up and said and this is really heartbreaking i just woke up crying and i dont even know why im crying
3558037 whoever may comment and whatever feedback you may get girls are very impressionable especially girls in this age that were talking about
3558038 i have a lot of confidence in her and in most kids if not all kids that they can figure it out if they have good guidance and caring people working with them
3558039 id much rather have her decide to stop if shes going to stop than to tell her to stop
3558040 it would have been fine with me if she didnt pick it back up again but i think it was healthy that she did i think it would have been a bad thing for this to be the reason to stop blogging shell grow out of it maybe maybe not
3558041 i would absolutely think that any parent who would comment on a blog without their kids permission is looking for serious trouble
3558042 so what you need to do is turn to your kids and say what are you doing online
3558043 not as an accusation but as a real question you have an interest in what are you doing will you show me you have to have the talk you have to sit down
3558044 if somebody else is in the picture unless they say its ok to use them take them out of it or shadow them a little bit

3558075 i resign the highest office in the land to become president of the united states
3558076 unless i am convicted by scripture and plain reason and i do not accept the authority of popes and councils for they have contradicted each other my conscience is held captive to the word of god
3558077 its pathetic and childish i want a written apology we came back from shopping to find the
3558078 it makes me feel theyre treating me like some sort of scruff basically something on the bottom of their shoe and theyre laughing at me

3558081 this is welcome news for new yorks hardworking farmers who are facing the burden of recovering from the financial and physical losses caused by this devastating hail storm
3558082 i am glad to see that the usda has taken my concerns seriously and issued this disaster declaration so our farmers will have access to the resources necessary to help them get back on their feet and salvage what they can from this season i strongly urge anybody who thinks they may be eligible for assistance from the usda to visit their local fsa office as soon as possible
3558083 she kept on locking her dog out about two weeks ago and the police were called to pick it up because it was running freely around the neighborhood
3558084 she was taking the knives and swords and flinging them into the ground like one of those artists movies shes been doing it for about two weeks now
3558085 she was always very nice very sweet quiet but very nice when i talked to her over the fence
3558086 its good especially in the third week to hit somebody else
3558087 you get used to the talent level here first teamers second teamers third teamers what their strength is what their weakness is its always nice to go against somebody you dont know you play a lot more honest because you dont know the tendencies it is a good evaluation process for all of us
3558088 they have a different style running attack than we do and a lot of similarities in the passing game
3558089 there is a little different philosophy but it will be good work for our defense and our offense
3558090 guys are fighting for their jobs so if you dont come out here 100 percent every day you will not be in this business long
3558091 come saturday the juices are going to be stirred whether were playing the cowboys or any other team

3558099 we will give serious consideration to anything we can do on the humanitarian front
3558100 there are indications that georgia asked a range of nation states including australia to consider military assistance
3558101 australia indicated at officials levels that we werent interested in providing military assistance
3558102 the judge confirmed that ebay acted diligently when it received letters from loreal

3558108 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3558109 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3558110 we are proceeding and the president is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3558111 morgan tsvangirai is the main opposition leader and any agreement that doesnt include his party will not work for the country it actually just complicates issues
3558112 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3558113 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3558114 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3558115 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3558116 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3558117 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3558118 the governments scheme just wont work and i wasnt prepared to risk putting up fuel prices on the basis of overwhelming evidence
3558119 getting this help in a consistently satisfying manner is as essential as it is challenging you will need perseverance courage and skill you will need to understand your needs and be committed to getting them
3558120 it is our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3558121 i know laundry isnt easy for you to do every time i find clean socks here i am reminded how much you love me and how blessed i am

3558192 i was sitting there and when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out

3558352 we have a number of older players with experience who i know can still do the job
3558353 certainly for the world cup qualifiers ill have a look at things and it might be a case of bringing more experience in
3558354 none of these players weir dailly or mcculloch has been ruled out but ive taken the opportunity to bring younger ones in to have a look at them knowing ill probably bring one or two more experienced players back for the world cup qualifiers
3558355 i became aware that kris could qualify for us a few months ago
3558356 i saw a lot of him when i was manager of derby and he was at nottingham forest he transferred to derby in the summer and i had him watched
3558357 i think he will give us a different dimension he has a lot of ability he is a naturally left sided winger and maybe weve lacked some width in the squad i spoke to kris and he was keen and enthusiastic to join us
3558358 darren barr meanwhile is one for the future he was involved with the b squad last year and is still finding his way but this was another good opportunity to bring a young player in
3558359 we are seeing a softening or a tempering or some slowing of revenue growth in particular in financial markets but its not nearly to the level that people have been worrying about
3558360 people were thinking we would go negative growth in the second half but all the businesses are quite positive the picture the way i see it is a slight slowing in keeping with the general economy which is slowing down but not the sort of falling out of bed we are seeing in media or some of the banking sector
3558361 people are feeling a little better than they did a few weeks ago but thats fragile and that could change
3558362 there will be some follow on reductions over the next year but the lions share is being done this year
3558363 i hesitate to give a number but my best estimate is over 1 000
3558364 i view this as just a sensible delayering as a result of bringing two companies together
3558365 the fact has not created in me a sense of obligation
3558366 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3558367 r us inc say they will stop selling baby bottles made with the chemical next year and the maker of the hard plastic nalgene water bottles announced in april that it would stop using the chemical
3558368 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3558369 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3558370 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3558371 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance

3558386 its hard to see how russia will pull out of south ossetia and abkhazia now georgia now will have a big hole in it
3558387 probably believed rather naively he might get more support from the united states
3558388 you could probably say georgia triggered it but russia was clearly ready to respond
3558389 the straw that broke the camels back was saakashvili and georgia moving into south ossetia
3558390 the west does not have a whole lot of leverage over russia right now
3558391 very much shows that russia calls the shots in the region
3558392 theres going to be a serious debate in the west now about how we deal with russia

3558402 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3558403 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3558404 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3558405 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3558406 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3558407 israel is hoping to maintain a low profile with regard to the war in georgia government officials told haaretz one source noted that currently neither side of the conflict is pleased with israels position since russia has been irked by israeli georgian weapons deals for some time and tbilisi is now frustrated by israels decision to halt arms exports

3558495 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3558496 we are committed to continuing the effort to try to reach a joint israeli palestinian document
3558497 hamas will not busy itself much on this issue because the palestinian people will never accept it

3558502 that dumbass survived a knife attack a drive by shooting and near catastrophic asthma attacks and ended up getting run over by his own car
3558503 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation

3558536 if i have any doubts about his health ill err on the side of caution
3558537 we need to win the next three games any way we can
3558538 ty swung the bat really well against jonathan sanchez and had a couple good hits for us
3558539 tonight this is a guy giants pitcher tim lincecum thats really tough on right handed hitters and i need to get my left handers up there
3558540 hunter works probably harder than most takes 150 to 200 swings a day
3558541 sometimes its too much you need less you need to back up a little bit so monday i noticed a little bit of frustration
3558542 you dont want to let the frustration go too far hes been swinging so good and i dont want him to go too far to that side a good day off relax maybe go work on some stuff and be ready for tomorrow
3558543 sometimes you have it sometimes you dont when you dont have it sometimes you just have to go in there and battle
3558544 theres no way to play when the rain is this widespread
3558545 everybodys working to get back here when they get sent out
3558546 i think i accomplished what i needed to accomplish in the minor leagues so hopefully i can come back and compete
3558547 just being able to throw all of my pitches for strikes and that was it really
3558548 im sure its frustrating for a lot of guys to have to play in the minor leagues and i was frustrated early on but i just told myself i have to come back and produce
3558549 i felt like i was a little more solid mechanically and hopefully well see soon
3558550 im glad he got a chance to pitch up here and ill be rooting for him from the dugout
3558551 well see how he throws tonight and go from there
3558552 were really happy for him hes earned this hes had a long path to the big leagues and nothings been handed to him hes gone out and been consistently good for pawtucket
3558553 where it goes from here well see but like theo said nothings been handed to him
3558554 when i get my arm up and accelerate through the slot and keep repeating that 100 some times its going to eventually shut down
3558555 i tried to grit my teeth and try to get through it but i think they made the right decision to shut me down so hopefully i can be healthy in september down the stretch
3558556 then to come in after the bullpen to find out we were going to send him down it really humbled me quite a bit i wasnt expecting that i had no idea that was going to happen
3558557 i went down there to work on stuff i didnt know when i was coming back but im happy that im back here now im just ready to get after it again
3558558 most of the time youre trying to get them to sink it or cut it
3558559 or get it to move just a little bit in that zone now were trying to straighten his out
3558560 there was really no urgency to try to fix what wasnt broken
3558561 they didnt know him that well but now when the league gets that film on you and they start bearing down on you and they start watching scenarios and sequences and everything like that they caught on
3558562 its not often that you see a big league pitcher that youre going to change his stuff thats something that you usually do in the minor leagues and then when you get him to the big leagues for the most part nine times out of 10 theyre a finished product
3558563 this was kind of a total transformation of a guy
3558564 its not new its something that weve talked about for awhile
3558565 were not there yet but its been a topic of conversation
3558566 a john maine start is not as important as what we need in the bullpen im using john maine as an example i can use a number of guys
3558567 its a pennant race and youve got to try to do everything you can to do what you feel is necessary in order to remain in this race
3558568 the idea of the center is not only to help sailors and marines in distress but to promote good stress management and promote psychological health so it starts when people come into boot camp and lasts all of the way until they graduate from war college
3558569 the idea is that we get past the concept of just dealing with things when they are in crisis and hopefully promote a system of addressing stress and addressing our ability to cope with it so we rarely get into a crisis mode
3558570 one of the things that i like to look at when people are training and they go through drills is how can we incorporate stress training into that so that they are more aware of when they are dealing with stress
3558571 when we talk about operational stress were talking about that unique set of circumstances that people have when they are deployed or when they are in the jobs that they do
3558572 for example somebody who works on the deck of an aircraft carrier has a much different level of stress than someone who is a civilian and works in an office building downtown
3558573 combat stress of course is the stress that occurs when you are in combat the extreme set of circumstances when your life is in danger and when you have to make life and death decisions quickly and when you are under extreme pressure
3558574 the center has four major divisions knowledge management programs research facilitation and strategic communications
3558575 i was running a fever of 104 degrees and it was hard to breathe i was weak and i couldnt sweat it off
3558576 its hard because a lot of people dont understand what im going through these days nobody has heard of sarcoidosis nobody knows anything about it
3558577 i was like oh my goodness could that happen to me
3558578 the medications you take suppress your immune system and then you get staph infections fungal infections and bacterial infections
3558579 having this disease with the funny name that no one knows about you feel very isolated
3558580 i couldnt talk id be coughing so hard and itd go on for 15 or 20 minutes they kept giving me stuff and none of it would help
3558581 im sorry to see him gone but hes bringing a lot of awareness of sarcoidosis to the forefront and thats a good thing
3558582 the hardest thing for me is doctors still arent really sure how to treat sarcoidosis symptoms
3558583 theres a lot of research on what to do for other diseases but not for this one so it can be hard to get the proper treatment
3558584 i respect the fact that they want me to do that because of the way the season has gone
3558585 i was looking forward to playing here in boston but ill go out and play hard on rehab and be ready to help my team
3558586 my feeling is we need to see hank play third base for three days

3558649 the decision was based purely on numbers on performance and carpenter has outperformed him right now thats the bottom line
3558650 we chart a ton of categories with the kickers and carpenter has outperformed him

3558658 i received emails about this cover from both authors or publishers in the same week
3558659 i am not a photo agency but a busy scientist so i dont keep very careful track of this sort of request of which i get too many and so yes in my mind i must have thought i was dealing with a single book and never realized i gave two permissions
3558660 i think its amusing that both decided to use the photo in about the same way but perhaps this is dictated with the vertical format of a book cover whereas the photo clearly is a horizontal one

3558665 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3558666 future status of two rebel zones in georgia was cut from the peace plan they said with talks to focus instead on how to ensure
3558667 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace mr medvedev told defence chiefs at a meeting on the south ossetia conflict though he warned any attacks by georgia would be

3558683 its been the same for years its been tested in court theres no interest in changing it
3558684 in 2008 we had no interest in changing things regarding polygamy but things have progressed a lot since then and now we feel there is a need to address this issue
3558685 i get draft speeches from the department all the time sometimes its msd sometimes its dol department of labour sometimes its health sometimes its education it depends what the speech is
3558686 ive got no idea im sort of not interested because i didnt say it and its not our policy
3558687 there would be nobody in msd who is under any illusion that that is government policy
3558688 historians will come to view aug 8 2008 as a turning point no less significant than nov 9 1989 when the berlin wall fell russias attack on sovereign georgian territory marked the official return of history indeed to an almost 19th century style of great power competition complete with virulent nationalisms battles for resources struggles over spheres of influence and territory and even though it shocks our 21st century sensibilities the use of military power to obtain geopolitical objectives yes we will continue to have globalization economic interdependence the european union and other efforts to build a more perfect international order but these will compete with and at times be overwhelmed by the harsh realities of international life that have endured since time immemorial the next president had better be ready
3558689 military intervention is out of the question economic sanctions given russias oil and europes need for it are a pipe dream diplomatic ostracism and moral stricture wont even save face
3558690 instead europe both western and eastern along with the united states and the concerned former soviet republics need to sit down conference and plot exactly how these new democracies are to maintain their independence and autonomy in the next decade hopefully they will reach the franklinesque conclusion that we must indeed all hang together or most assuredly we shall all hang separately
3558691 no doubt the buying power of our target group the upper middle income earners may be slightly affected due to the rising cost of living
3558692 nevertheless with good service and innovative products we are confident of maintaining our position in the market
3558693 as more businesses turn to the web for expansion many will find that they are inexperienced at implementing a secure work environment

3558698 die entwicklung in georgien zeigt deutlich die verh ngnisvollen konsequenzen einer amerikanischen politik die seit l ngerem darauf ausgerichtet ist den eigenen einfluss in osteuropa und asien zu st rken auf russische befindlichkeiten keine r cksicht zu nehmen
3558699 die georgische initiative gewiss nicht ohne wissen der amerikanischen regierung ins werk gesetzt worden
3558700 wenn georgien mit seinen ungel sten territorialproblemen in die nato aufgenommen werden w rde
3558701 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3558702 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3558703 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3558704 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3558705 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3558706 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3558707 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3558708 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3558709 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3558710 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3558711 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3558712 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3558713 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3558714 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3558715 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3558716 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3558717 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3558718 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3558719 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3558720 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3558721 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3558722 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3558723 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3558724 who are open to doing something on the production side
3558725 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3558726 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3558727 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3558728 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3558729 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3558730 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3558731 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3558732 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3558733 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3558734 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3558735 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3558736 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3558737 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3558738 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3558739 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3558740 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3558741 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3558742 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3558743 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3558744 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3558745 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3558746 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3558747 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3558748 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3558749 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3558750 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3558751 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3558752 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3558753 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3558754 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3558755 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3558756 i do not have any pain or soreness in my knee
3558757 i know ive got to keep that in mind and try not to let all the pressure overwhelm me
3558758 for me i dont know if this is the right thing to say but hes yet to play in an nba practice hes yet to play in an nba game so i think the expectations are more on him personally than it is on everybody else
3558759 we know how good he can be but he is still a rookie
3558760 he favors dunking on your head thats what he favors
3558761 i think a lot of people forgot how good we could have been last year
3558762 a lot of people say this is gregs team i think were a great team and greg is just a great addition hes going to open the floor up a lot for us
3558763 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3558764 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3558765 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3558766 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3558767 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3558768 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3558769 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3558770 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3558771 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3558772 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3558773 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3558774 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3558775 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3558776 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3558777 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3558778 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3558779 im a smart guy im not saying im a coach or anything but i know our defense needs rest if we can run the ball keep the clock moving and let our defense be in a good position there you go
3558780 if we can start breaking those 4 or 5 or 6 yard runs its gonna bring that safety down and then were one on one on the outside
3558781 right now i feel like marvin harrison and reggie wayne are the standard bearers
3558782 i would love to put us up there but youve also got t j houshmandzadeh and chad johnson in the mix with the cincinnati bengals
3558783 as for us we need to prove ourselves as a duo but we do pose a threat on paper so well see
3558784 have a great day oh wait you forgot your gas mask
3558785 please find another place for this crappy piece of tank i just chipped my pedicure on it

3558789 please take your underwear off your head and hand mommy her wallet
3558790 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3558791 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3558792 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3558793 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3558794 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3558795 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3558796 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3558797 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3558798 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3558799 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3558839 i said lets do it as kind of like marionettes
3558840 its great to be able to break out of the actual formula that the features are in and just sort of have fun in a world youve created
3558841 oil and gas have bought rich benefits for the majority of aberdonians the unemployment rate is well below that of the scottish average at just 0 8 per cent gross weekly earnings are on average 606 a fifth higher than the rest of the country and the recruitment centres have more jobs than applicants

3558848 you made the right decision letting henry and thurman go we need to cut down on the knucklehead factor
3558849 chris is presently under nfl suspension and until such time as he may be reinstated we are not in position to comment
3558850 even in the event he is reinstated he is no longer our player and rarely if ever do we comment on any player who is not under contract with us
3558851 thats why i like the investments in infrastructure and debt relief and even some broad based tax relief as options
3558852 hi josh michelle its mom im on my way to the hospital headed to xxx xxx they think i may be having a heart attack i dont know if you have husband s phone number its xxx xxxx hes on his way there too bye
3558853 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you
3558854 i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions
3558855 we didnt have a fight no one cheated it plain didnt work
3558856 we were both small town people doing very big things and we relied on each other dealing with fame i dont know the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
3558857 i dont want to name names even though he probably deserves it but he fooled around
3558858 it was one of those things that everyone knew but me and he seemed perfect in every way
3558859 our scouting department is not going to complain if we walk into next years draft and get two picks in the top 10
3558860 that wont be a complaint we hope to sign crow were going to work hard to sign crow but it is good to know that at the end of the day if you dont do it youre still going to get two of the top 10 next year

3558863 at 115 a barrel we see the industry turning a profit in 2009
3558864 if sustained is a game changing event for the industry
3558865 this isnt the same industry that gave us pause last march
3558866 this represents both the most rapid and most significant expense savings ever realized for the airlines
3558867 significant fall in oil prices has given airlines substantial breathing room even if demand does weaken
3558868 we look at the companies ability to pay their obligations their creditworthiness we still think airlines are fragile and they are burning through cash
3558869 its not outrageous to suggest that whats already been done may be enough to get the industry profitable in 2009

3558878 i havent been willingly photographed in a bikini for seven years and i dont think ill do it again
3558879 i dont have a strict diet any more i eat cake crisps sugar free chocolate and chips if i want to i cant be bothered to follow a gruelling food plan im a petite person and if i eat relatively healthily ill stay that way
3558880 a page and a half of posts discussing whether or not i was mocking egyptians by referencing sankrit
3558881 theres this dictatorial leader who im sure wears a mumu and chansmokes parliaments
3558882 lemmie explain something to you this is sort of my field
3558883 i didnt swoop in i came in the same way everybody else did
3558884 well now im telling you to open the ward window and climb out of there before they give you a pre frontal lobotomy and i have to come in and smother you with a pillow
3558885 like hitler obama uses simple messages to win over people like hitler obama seeks to disband freedoms like hitler obama supporters faint and cry when he speaks like hitler obama campaigns on hope like hitler obama speaks of change like hitler obama campaigns on unity like hitler obama is popular in a time of economic weakness like hitler obama has an emblem seal like hitler obama targets youth
3558886 like hitler jesus uses simple messages to win over people like hitler jesus seeks to disband freedoms like hitler jesus supporters faint and cry when he speaks like hitler jesus campaigns on hope like hitler jesus speaks of change like hitler jesus campaigns on unity like hitler jesus is popular in a time of economic weakness like hitler jesus has an emblem seal like hitler jesus targets youth
3558887 i was thinking this week how much this european tour reminded me of eva peron and her tour of europe in evita
3558888 if you think that drawing crowds appealing to young people and talking about hope were what made hitler bad for the world you dont know enough about hitler hitler was bad because he suspended civil liberties and killed jews if you have some actual evidence that obama will literally do that then we can talk but all you have is a similarity between their campaigns sorry but talking about hope and change to large crowds does not alone a fascist make
3558889 the methods being used are the same you can disagree
3558890 but penguindust the reverend dr martin luther king jr and ron paul are about love and hitler and obama are about hate 111
3558891 i never considered such similarities between these two politicians yes i know you did not which is why i am here however nurse ratched remained unconvinced
3558892 nah i dont think that is true and i dont accept
3558893 if you use a colloquialism or a slang word or phrase simply use it do not draw attention to it by enclosing it in quotation marks to do so is to put on airs as this is my most recent project an ork with a rokkit launcher though you were inviting the reader to join you in a select society of those who know better
3558894 your comments were incredibly rude and uncalled for and certainly does not exhibit any measure of
3558895 obama certainly doesnt seem to be furthering any amero centric nationalism unless i missed that speech
3558896 yes its a pity that obama is not pro america his wife certainly isnt nor are some of the people he associates with
3558897 once again shame on you you know in your heart that you should indeed be ashamed for trivializing the holocaust in order to gain cheap political points
3558898 you seem to have confused patriotism and nationalism in my comments i assure you i meant the latter
3558899 at the current rate borrowing is more attractive than saving
3558900 uitm merupakan salah satu daripada hak hak istimewa orang melayu di bawah artikel 153 perlembagaan persekutuan dan canselornya ialah yang di pertuan agong sendiri
3558901 apa yang pelik ialah isu pembukaan kemasukan ke institusi pengajian untuk bumiputera ini kepada bangsa asing dibangkitkan oleh seorang melayu sendiri bukannya bangsa asing
3558902 jika mereka tidak boleh bergaul dan bekerja dengan bangsa asing di sektor pekerjaan bagaimana mereka dapat pergi jauh di dalam kerjaya mereka dan perlu diingat 12 peratus daripada tenaga pengajar uitm ini adalah bangsa asing dan mereka dihormati dan disenangi oleh para pelajar bumiputera di dalam institusi ini
3558903 kes dia ini abdul khalid pada anggapan saya mungkin ada kaitan dengan pilihan raya kecil akan datang di pulau pinang parlimen parmatang pauh supaya semua orang melayu menyokong anwar penasihat parti keadilan rakyat pkr datuk seri anwar ibrahim dan menang agaknya
3558904 saya mungkin silap tetapi rayuan saya kepada rakan rakan bukan melayu supaya jangan mudah terpengaruh dan jangan berfikir secara sempit
3558905 i am really amazed that a woman would object to a daddy treating his daughters even little ones to a special
3558906 any clod who cannot afford roses needs to climb back into the freight car and hit the road
3558907 many women do noble things but you surpass them all
3558908 it is written as surely as i live says the lord every knee will bow before me every tongue will confess to god
3558909 if a man will not work he shall not eat 2 thessalonians 3 10
3558910 you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their high officials exercise authority over them mt 20 26 not so with you instead whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant mt 20 27 and whoever wants to be first must be your slave mt 20 28 just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
3558911 to grant suspected terrorists the same rights as those fighting to protect our nation is wrong i consider this one of the most chilling legal rulings in my lifetime giving alleged foreign combatants the same rights as any american provides potential ammunition to those with political agendas running counter to the commander in chief our nations enemies will now have the ability to gum up our federal courts with baseless legal challenges and further hinder the pursuit of justice
3558912 the most generous set of procedural protections ever afforded aliens detained by this country as enemy combatants the political branches crafted these procedures amidst an ongoing military conflict after much careful investigation and thorough debate the court rejects them today out of hand without bothering to say what due process rights the detainees possess without explaining how the statute fails to vindicate those rights and before a single petitioner has even attempted to avail himself of the laws operation one cannot help but think think after surveying the modest practical results of the majoritys ambitious opinion that this decision is not really about the detainees at all but about control of federal policy regarding enemy combatants
3558913 our nation will live to regret what the court has done today
3558914 will almost certainly cause more americans to be killed that consequence would be tolerable if necessary to preserve a time honored legal principle vital to our constitutional republic but it is this courts blatant abandonment of such a principle that produces the decision today
3558915 this sends a confounding message to our men and women in uniform within our intelligence community and to our allies their hard fought efforts to capture terrorist suspects maybe for naught because they could simply be released back on the battlefield on a legal technicality
3558916 train a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not turn from it pr 22 6
3558917 a very brave stab at writing the great post troubles northern irish novel
3558918 they say the air over jerusalem is thick with prayers and dublin might have its fair share of storytellers but this is where the real bullshit artists live the air over this town is thick with lies thousands of prisoners have been released under the cease fire agreements thousands of gunmen walking these streets making up a past a false narrative of peace and tranquility
3558919 if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row im not sharp its just a fact im more sharp if i get a little rest
3558920 adrian saw her with shia labeouf and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out he obviously didnt appreciate it
3558921 all of their options which includes appealing the case to the supreme court
3558922 we are disappointed with todays ruling and are considering all of our appellate options
3558923 it is simply unacceptable for top government officials to be unaccountable for such a gross abuse of their power here not only did these officials cause untold harm to two individuals who honorably served their country they also jeopardized our national security for short term political gain courts must be available to remedy precisely this kind of harm to ensure such conduct is neither condoned nor repeated
3558924 the alleged means by which defendants chose to rebut mr wilsons comments and attack his credibility may have been highly unsavory
3558925 but there can be no serious dispute that the act of rebutting public criticism such as that levied by mr wilson against the bush administrations handling of prewar foreign intelligence by speaking with members of the press is within the scope of defendants duties as high level executive branch officials
3558926 this case is not just about what top government officials did to valerie and me
3558927 we brought this suit because we strongly believe that politicizing intelligence ultimately serves only to undermine the security of our nation todays decision is just the first step in what we have always known would be a long legal battle and we are committed to seeing this case through
3558928 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
3558929 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
3558930 when that guy was working for ken starr he wanted to go open the dresser drawers of the white house
3558931 i guess its a lot different when its a republican vice president
3558932 personnel evaluation is a very inexact science because of one thing
3558933 it is very hard to figure out what is in somebodys head what kind of passion they have for whatever they do and all that kind of stuff
3558934 i had a guy one time that we recruited that everybody was recruiting when i was at michigan state and i asked tough questions
3558935 what do you think you need to do to become a good player this guy was 40 pounds overweight the guy sat there and looked at me he hadnt figured it out after we had talked to him all weekend about how he needs to loose forty pounds so we didnt recruit the guy because if he doesnt know he doesnt know then it is going to be hard for us to convince him he needs to do it
3558936 at this point the prospect gets a grade and he gets categorized
3558937 their grades consist of size and speed for their position athletic ability to play their position character and attitude and academic criteria
3558938 we have a lettering system to explain if a player has a character issue or academic issue or injuries or size
3558939 not one of these things can kill you in other words you could be a a little short for the criteria we want but you can overcome it with your ability and your production as a performer and the type of person you are and all that type of stuff
3558940 we have a scale 1 5 for lets say linebacker 6 3 may be a one 6 2 a two and you go right down the scale also you have a weight criteria that is on the same scale and then you have a speed criteria that is on the same scale
3558941 so if we had a 5 11 linebacker for example and the number one scale was 240 and the running speed was 4 6 and he was 5 11 240 4 6 he is a 5 1 1 which is 7 divided by 3 because he overcomes his size with great speed and has the weight he ends up being a guy that is a potential prospect as long as you go to the position criteria and he ranks very highly because he has to overcome a deficiency
3558942 and a guy comes out with a player number then he comes out with a character attitude number then you figure out this is the best guy for us to recruit
3558943 we came back from shopping to find the back door smashed in and on the kitchen work top
3558944 the police here didnt tell us much so i went to the station to ask why
3558945 but when i told the desk sergeant i didnt know who they were looking for they just werent interested
3558946 when i came home i noticed the fridge magnets had been rearranged and said oldham task force called
3558947 these are for children theyre not for the police to leave a message theyve raided your house
3558948 i cannot forecast to you the action of russia it is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma but perhaps there is a key that key is russian national interest
3558949 this week of camp is probably the most difficult week
3558950 you start getting a critical mass of guys on your team that buy into that and you have very few guys who dont do it that way
3558951 and i think they recognize the guys that dont buy in and there are very few of those guys left around
3558952 big emphasis on being a better third down team on turnovers and red area efficiency on both sides of the ball
3558953 i think he has managed his weight a little bit better it is one of those situations where he needed to do everything right to get back on the team and we are pleased with the progress he made
3558954 we will closely monitor prices and were hoping prices will stabilize in the second half of this year
3558955 not only does one drink wine but one inhales it tastes it and then talks about it
3558956 the georgians opened fire on us from the windows of five story apartment buildings on either side of the road
3558957 you wont see any more georgians on the territory of south ossetia again
3558958 this is just another way hes making history and we want to be part of it
3558959 i was so nervous i dont know if i saw it really well but i think its a good likeness
3558960 they showed them yesterday and i looked at them online i was planning to buy them but never dreamed we would do this
3558961 presley place where the money will go we contribute to them every year
3558962 also i want that on display in my living room in a curio cabinet
3558963 is vulnerable to adversaries who seek information about our nations homeland defense programs classified or unclassified
3558964 any real or possible contacts with foreign intelligence services terrorists or foreign criminal enterprises
3558965 we are committed to working with fda to make sure physicians understand this information
3558966 you know all the personal freedom issues that the democrats seem to support like gay and lesbian rights reform of drug laws and abortion rights but never do much about libertarians support your right to personal freedom and all the economic freedom issues that republicans seem to support like limited government free markets and free trade but never do much about libertarians support your right to economic freedom
3558967 among other grand achievements f a hayek had a remarkable career pointing out the flaws in collectivism one of his keenest insights was that paradoxically any collectivist system necessarily depends on one individual or small group to make key social and economic decisions in contrast a system based on individualism takes advantage of the aggregate or collective information of the whole society through his actions each participant contributes his own particular if incomplete knowledge information that could never be tapped by the individual at the head of a collectivist state
3558968 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
3558969 the unity of a nations spirit and will are worth far more than the freedom of the spirit and will of an individual and that the higher interests involved in the life of the whole must here set the limits and lay down the duties of the interests of the individual
3558970 we need to stop worrying about the rights of the individual and start worrying about what is best for society
3558971 we understand only the individuals capacity to make sacrifices for the community for his fellow men
3558972 were going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good
3558973 to be a socialist is to submit the i to the thou socialism is sacrificing the individual to the whole
3558974 we fired a total of 1 104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city between 4 p m and 11 39 p m on friday which successfully intercepted a stretch of rain belt from moving towards the stadium
3558975 under such a weather condition a small bubble in the rain cloud would have triggered rainfall let alone a lightening
3558976 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3558977 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3558978 a single endorsement does not hide the fact that sen obama has no record of achievement beyond the confines of his party
3558979 while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests sen obamas record is a lesson in partisanship
3558980 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3558981 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3558982 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3558983 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them
3558984 theres a distinction between trumpeting issues and realistically looking at effectiveness
3558985 i have never known a time period where the american brand has been in less repair
3558986 we just want to retain the small area on waikanae beach where we take our kids and know theyll be safe from the risk of being approached and chased by unleashed dogs
3558987 if i asked my dog to run up that hill right now she would do it
3558988 she would never give up she just loves to work
3558989 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
3558990 the marketers of a line of dietary supplements have agreed to pay 2 5 million to settle federal trade commission charges that claims about their oregano oil and capsules were false and unsubstantiated in violation of federal law according to the ftc
3558991 meeting someone in stablers life who we havent met before
3558992 then he just stood up on his hind legs and jumped on me
3558993 to see my little brother bleeding was scary i should have seen that big bear coming
3558994 he was mad because he didnt get what he wanted he was going to make his stand
3558995 i dont know if you would call a bear like that a demented bear like some people or a super bear that decides hey i can take a person
3558996 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
3558997 we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals
3558998 i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans
3558999 if nebraska is going to be pigheaded and kick him off unreasonably
3559000 there has to be another wrestling program thats going to want him
3559001 its not money that they would be making working as a waiter
3559002 im in my mid 40s and my generation has a stigma about porn
3559003 the kids the generation of the student athletes dont have that stigma they really dont care
3559004 theyve come from a paris hilton tommy lee pamela anderson sex tape generation myspace pages the shame and stigma arent there for them theyre mostly worried about what their parents are going to think because their parents think its horrifying
3559005 theres nothing we can do about this get used to it
3559006 i feel like a bad person for doing what i did am i a bad person
3559007 no you are a wonderful compassionate human being whose trying really hard to deal with lifes complications what you did for that person was from the love in your heart they may not get over it who knows how they will see what youve had to do on their behalf but you know and i know that you did it to ensure another human being gets help you may have saved their life

3559015 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3559016 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3559017 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3559018 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3559019 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3559020 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3559021 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3559022 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3559023 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3559024 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3559025 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3559026 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3559027 these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack
3559028 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3559029 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3559030 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3559031 there is accountability through the contract and to the contracting officer
3559032 he brings with him more than twenty years of extensive business experience ranging from president and chief executive officer of a privately held multi national manufacturing company to a publicly traded international marketing company with four wholly owned subsidiaries in the united states and international concerns jim piccolo s successful career as a nationally recognized after market sport truck accessory entrepreneur and designer proved his ability to carve out successful market niches
3559033 to succeed you must build relationships and recognize that you create your own success when you create success for others
3559034 i said i would beat him before the race but i was just saying that i felt i had to make that statement as a competitor but i never believed it when he goes into the water he is just a man on his own separate from everyone
3559035 the truth is that is an honour to be in the same final as this man
3559036 hey ive always been good in the water its what i happen to do
3559037 i havent talked here about breaking marks record gold medals in the munich olympics seven because im not yet halfway there
3559038 ive spent some time with carl lewis and ive had a few words with mark and ive begun to learn what this means if it happens well it will be unbelievable
3559039 i learnt a very difficult truth in my difficult childhood good never comes on a silver platter while talent is primarily perseverance and hard work
3559040 when i saw bernard with a full body length lead i thought thats it but when jason did it i just thought wow that shows anything is possible
3559041 there is only one way i can go it is to take each race as it comes and then make sure i get the best possible rest i was very pleased today i just wanted to be out on my own which i was by the 100 metre mark i was out in open water and i was in the middle his draw in lane six after doing the mere necessities in the heats which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me i knew park would have a strong last 50 metres so i had to keep my focus and my concentration
3559042 just because i dont talk about my goals it doesnt mean i dont have them or that i want to achieve them very badly
3559043 you might not think it but everything that comes up michael uses for motivation and look where its taken him

3559046 the club which holds two week outings outside san francisco at the bohemian grove where members run about in the woods naked includes many former republican officials editors note from ny times a brief article on june 11 reported the resignation of from the all male bohemian club in california after his appointment as counselor to president clinton the article said the club holds two week outings every summer at which members run about in the woods naked although similar assertions have appeared in various newspapers over the years the times should have cited evidence or attribution to support that description of what the members do at the outings or should have omitted it richard k arnold a spokesman for the club says it is not true
3559047 the bohemian grove that i attend from time to time the inaudible and the others come there but it is the most faggy goddamn thing that you would ever imagine the san francisco crowd that goes in there its just terrible i cant even shake hands with anybody from san francisco
3559048 if i were to choose the speech that gave me the most pleasure and satisfaction in my political career it would be my lakeside speech at the bohemian grove in july 1967 because this speech traditionally was off the record it received no publicity at the time but in many important ways it marked the first milestone on my road to the presidency
3559049 when he did not return home we thought he had stayed overnight at his elder sisters house there
3559050 i have been working for several years now to build
3559051 the realization of new human possibilities for association depend on recognizing the plurality of economic options that already exist in our societies
3559052 ah thats why you speak like that famous brazilian plastic surgeon
3559053 the htmltextwriter does not have a public constructor taking in a textwriter
3559054 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3559055 so this was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran that we feel we can trust
3559056 even as the u s economy softens unionbancal has been able to deliver very strong performance
3559057 with the u s economy possibly worsening is it really a good idea to use that much money to make it a full subsidiary
3559058 theres nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you
3559059 i think he realises we werent too far away from them when they were playing at the very top of their game
3559060 with the injuries and stuff that has been going on at our place we as players can all raise the bar a little bit and with it being that close with us missing out by two points on the premiership and in the champions league final i think they know that every year were going to give them a right good run for their money
3559061 it still hurts me to see pictures of united lifting the trophy at wigan last season we made that trophy ours when jose mourinho first took over we want it back and thats what were aiming for
3559062 frank and didier know now theyre at chelsea and weve got to make it happen this year
3559063 hopefully things can get resolved with frank with the contract as hes been our best player for the last four of five years and we want to keep him
3559064 scolaris a very experienced man like ferguson and knows exactly what hes doing im sure the managers got a few tricks up his sleeve along the way hes a quiet man and doesnt want to get involved in the mind games and hopefully we can stop him getting involved by taking an early lead in the premiership and leading the way
3559065 ive been awfully lucky to get the armband in the past and those memories will stay with me forever but its one man making the big decision hes taken his time and hell make the right decision whoever he chooses ill fully respect if its not me ill walk up to the person shake their hand and wish them well england can move on from that point
3559066 you look at the best players in the world and a lot of them bat at three or four
3559067 you want to test yourself as much as you can and batting at no3 you do that you could be in after the first ball or three hours later that challenges your skills as a batsman and that is what i want to face up to
3559068 it looks like i might get an opportunity now at no3 and it is up to me to take that opportunity i have always done it for warwickshire and i see no reason i cant do it at the next level
3559069 i look at the team now and it is quite different to the one i came into with marcus trescothick vaughan simon jones and ashley giles those guys are no longer there and with 43 test matches i am one of the senior players it is now a time in my career where i should not see myself or allow other people to see me as a young player anymore it is time to step up and deliver everything i can to help kp
3559070 i know i can do it but i have to start converting those fifties into hundreds like i did at lords being 26 now i have got experience behind me and i know a bit more about test cricket hopefully i can use that to really drive myself forward i am desperate to become a better player
3559071 anyone that looks into the england dressing room and sees the talent inside it would believe that it is possible we can win the ashes the important thing in the lead up to 2005 was that we were winning test matches regularly we desperately need that consistency back in our game
3559072 every man did that which was right in his own eyes
3559073 but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god
3559074 every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoreth his head but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoreth her head for that is all one as if she were shaven
3559075 for that is even all one as if she were shaven for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered
3559076 forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god
3559077 and god said let us make man in our image so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him
3559078 might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of god
3559079 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female but ye are all one in christ jesus
3559080 let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law and if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church
3559081 let the women learn in silence with all subjection but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence
3559082 judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering
3559083 every man did that which was right in his own eyes
3559084 but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god
3559085 every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoreth his head but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoreth her head for that is all one as if she were shaven
3559086 for that is even all one as if she were shaven for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered
3559087 forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god
3559088 and god said let us make man in our image so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him
3559089 might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of god
3559090 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female but ye are all one in christ jesus
3559091 let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law and if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church
3559092 let the women learn in silence with all subjection but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence
3559093 judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering
3559094 there is the sea vast and spacious teeming with creatures beyond number living things both large and small there the ships go to and fro and the leviathan great sea creature which you formed to frolic there these all look to you to give them their food at the proper time when you give it to them they gather it up when you open your hand they are satisfied with good things
3559095 that is when the storms come lets all keep that in mind when the storms come wink but soon afterward a violent wind of the character of a typhoon called a northeaster came bursting down from the island
3559096 as we were being dangerously tossed about by the violence of the storm the next day they began to throw the freight overboard
3559097 so brace up your minds be sober circumspect morally alert set your hope wholly and unchangeably on the grace divine favor that is coming to you when jesus christ the messiah is revealed
3559098 that night the lord appeared to paul and said then enter into your secret place with him hide yourself in the cleft of the rock show the wonder of your great love you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes
3559099 but when you pray go away by yourself shut the door behind you and pray to your father in private then your father who sees everything will reward you
3559100 more to the point do you even know what sport the boston cannons play
3559101 the state of your life is nothing more than a reflection of your state of mind
3559102 i am wow i feel pretty good for my age
3559103 it takes a little bit more logistics than probably the average family
3559104 the question is how the hell did us intelligence assets miss the russian black sea fleet movements how did they miss the massive transport job of the troops and their logistical tail they did not just materialize in position
3559105 what i really strove to do with this book is to get womens voices into islamic history
3559106 i was thinking about aisha and her strengths id read about what a strong witty influential leader she was
3559107 shes got the world debating a book no one has even read
3559108 if i do have threats of violence shes done it by alerting the muslims by calling it soft core porn by saying it made fun of islam
3559109 we understand the book is not historical documentation but it still uses the real characters of aisha and muhammad
3559110 it would be very tough to convince religious people that the novel isnt pretending to be the correct history
3559111 when combined with falsification of the islamic past it exploits americans who know nothing about aisha or her seventh century world and counts on stirring up controversy to increase sales
3559112 who better to watch the backs of the new champions mikey is one of the craziest and one of the most innovative wrestlers we have ever had the pleasure to be around hell be a perfect fit in wrestlereality along our side where he belongs
3559113 there doesnt seem to be a wp config php file i need this before we can get started need more help we got it you can create a wp config php file through a web interface but this doesnt work for all server setups the safest way is to manually create the file
3559114 is rural land management the problem or the solution to flooding in our towns and cities
3559115 you want to be worrying about the floods which will inevitably follow this drought
3559116 i accept hope peace joy and love in all aspects of my life
3559117 saya mohon kak saya tak mau satu sel dengan pak ishak
3559118 saya takut pada bos saya dia ditahan duluan sementara saya baru sekarang saya takut kalau tidur saya diapa apain
3559119 lets have no more of this lets get together and design a system of government and co operation which ensures that we never fight each other again and what is more we never starve again
3559120 whatever we collective and individually choose to want it to be for
3559121 that the future is unknowable is expressed in the present as communication society is irritated but has only one way to react to its irritation in its own manner of operation communication
3559122 the land had been here far longer than the human race and it will be here for a long time after we are gone
3559123 have we got the balance right between protecting the environment and producing food
3559124 i have given up living the countryside to protect the countryside from being spoiled
3559125 have we got the balance right between protecting the environment and producing food
3559126 this as not a simple equation protecting the environment versus producing food
3559127 i went from having her tuition paid to being a mile away
3559128 hey this is a good guy the last bastion of decency in a shallow corrupt world he loves kittens did i mention kittens like him
3559129 a science magazine investigation uses clues from a key document unveiled last week to
3559130 no one received material from that flask without going through dr ivins
3559131 we thoroughly investigated every other person who could have had access to the flask and we were able to rule out all but dr ivins
3559132 the type implies a retrogressive step in evolution an inferior species who cannot endure unfortunately they are able to pass on their wretchedness degenerate men seem unconsciously to choose their mates among them and so they breed fortunately the offspring go under either because their repressed instincts break out uncontrollably or because their hopes of achieving equality with men are crushed
3559133 when i go to a recordings store these days i find myself going through the motions my eye drifts nervously up to the clock as i calculate what time it is at various radio stations across the globe plotting my next date with the live concerts on my computer radio has won back my heart and i know i will never have to leave it again
3559134 this is just another way hes making history and we want to be part of it
3559135 i was so nervous i dont know if i saw it really well but i think its a good likeness
3559136 they showed them yesterday and i looked at them online i was planning to buy them but never dreamed we would do this
3559137 presley place where the money will go we contribute to them every year
3559138 also i want that on display in my living room in a curio cabinet
3559139 inspiration grew out of the countless falsehoods and gross inaccuracies being perpetuated by the opponents of the church
3559140 if you want to write a book stop talking about it and just start writing
3559141 i didnt want anyone to read it and come away unscathed
3559142 anak anak ini walau pun bukan anak kita tetapi allah beri pada kita pangkat pengaruh bukan secara mutlak tetapi diberi untuk disoal akhirat nanti untuk menjaga tanggungjawab ini
3559143 oftentimes an eating problem can be curbed by having regular monogamous healthy sex
3559144 by satisfying one appetite center you seem to satisfy the other
3559145 early 20th century faith healers were renowned for being grossly obese to avoid absorbing their patients symptoms
3559146 extreme stress as in the case of a car accident or even exercise turns off your hunger
3559147 chronic stress like a long list of looming deadlines or family problems can make you crave feel good carbohydrates
3559148 many people have made food their enemy for them eating is a stressful experience
3559149 you usually dont treasure what you have until you lost it
3559150 at 5 30pm shanmuganathan slipped from the riverbank and fell into the river he shouted for help but the other devotees could not help as the currents were too strong
3559151 i did not keep a copy of my written report in my personal file
3559152 the gold medal is the best birthday present i have ever had
3559153 i hope the luck can be with me all the time
3559154 i hope to be diving with her for a long time
3559155 with these machines our officers will be able to trace drugs even those swallowed by smugglers in an attempt to evade detection there is no way drug mules can pass the lines at our airports any more
3559156 we will have state of the art technology in areas where smuggling is rampant
3559157 mab will provide advance passenger information to enable us to do risk management and monitoring
3559158 we have our rover team of plainclothes personnel at klia who are alert to the body language of suspicious passengers the machines will complement their efforts to cripple syndicates or unwarranted operations
3559159 he has no power to do that matters related to student intakes is under the jurisdiction of higher educational institutions
3559160 this is somewhat extraordinary it is weird that a malay leader should voice out something under article 153 and i am giving this opinion as a professional for the good of the country and not only for bumiputeras
3559161 the majority of students in critical fields like accounting and pharmacy in public higher learning institutions are non malays and in private higher learning institutions 90 per cent of the students are non malays
3559162 our constitution stresses balance this is a statistic which should be understood by any leader government or opposition body and nobody should begrudge uitm as the only public university for bumiputeras
3559163 as a leader we should speak carefully and not just base our statements on our own perception many uitm students now hold top positions in both the public and private sector
3559164 if pakatan rakyat becomes the ruling government not only can they open up uitm to non bumiputeras they can also change the constitution including turning the country into a republic
3559165 i hope malaysians will think carefully before they make their decisions and not be influenced by those who speak only for their own political benefit to gain the support of malays
3559166 i liken the person who made the statement as a kerbau dicucuk hidung just a follower i could not fault those who push for this as they are fighting for their race
3559167 but abdul khalid as a leader should think before making such a statement and not betray his own race
3559168 the existence of uitm is in accordance with the new economic policy to eradicate poverty and restructure society
3559169 we do not have records of students or staff members being involved in previous political campaigns and we want to ensure that the university continues to keep a clean record
3559170 we believe in giving these students the opportunity to follow their dreams of being a writer and to highlight the talent that exist in our schools
3559171 it is our hope that pakatan rakyat will continue to protect the interests of muslims as is enshrined in the federal constitution
3559172 we hope this will be so if the pakatan rakyat goes on to form the federal government after sept 16
3559173 we can say that no part of the tree will be wasted if we look at the returns we believe a mature tree has a price tag of about rm50 000
3559174 that is a lot of money for one tree and we have no shortage of buyers for the agarwood and the by products
3559175 we have looked at the success of agarwood projects in vietnam and thailand and with the high demand from the perfumery industry and high price for the raw material we can encourage the people to grow the species as a long term investment
3559176 the poor need only grow between five and 10 trees around their house
3559177 we have seen the pictures of the person involved in the incident but we dont know who he is
3559178 the three leaders have agreed to put aside their differences and concentrate on the by election to ensure of a bn victory
3559179 we will lodge a police report if this exploitation is not stopped this is a warning
3559180 i was told that some orang asli had been cutting down trees and not cultivating their land before moving on to a new area
3559181 people will understand why we have done this if it is explained to them this is where the media can play a crucial role in informing the public
3559182 we cannot just depend on tongkangs small vessels and small weapons to defend our country
3559183 that was a lesson learnt for us to take greater initiative to safeguard our sovereignty otherwise we stand to lose a lot on natural resources like oil which are within our exclusive economic zone
3559184 you should be grateful to our security forces for providing peace and safety you can be assured of sleeping peacefully
3559185 now he and the villagers can rest easy thanks to the security provided by our troops
3559186 i hope she can recover in time but we are not rushing her if she feels up to it she will compete in desaru after all she has registered herself for the event
3559187 maybe our triathletes are not as experienced as the overseas professionals and lack the international experience needed to take them a step higher but this the desaru triathlon is a good platform for them to excel
3559188 it has been a tiring season for eugene and there are a couple more competitions until the end of the year and i hope he can last the pace in fact he is still recovering from a bout of fever
3559189 we were surprised by what the president said but it was received with an encouraging response there were shouts of allahuakbar from the floor
3559190 we were also happy to receive an assurance that pas is still very much committed to its struggle to uphold islam despite having moved from its conservative stance on issues related to religion
3559191 penang pas youth wants to remind pakatan rakyat that islam should be given priority if the coalition succeeds in wresting power from the bn
3559192 we just clicked today yesterday and i have to say this is the first time we have combined so well since losing our form last year
3559193 markis hendra are the world champions and we have nothing to lose the pressure is on them
3559194 since this is the first time the petrol price will be reviewed monthly lets go step by step and see how it goes
3559195 when everything is okay and there are no technical problems maybe we can review it every two weeks
3559196 the medals are too far away to talk about now
3559197 were not thinking of the medal round were going game by game
3559198 both parties have agreed on mutually agreeable terms to part company
3559199 this will encourage me to make better films and ask for more loans from finas the national film development corporation
3559200 i believe that we must understand film and watch it more than just purely for entertainment
3559201 that is why i believe in making films that demand people to think
3559202 kala malam bulan mengambang is inspired from european japanese and malay noir elements so people who watch this film will have to watch it with an open mind and not purely for its entertainment value
3559203 for both the awards i was wondering who would win and i was really surprised when they mentioned my name because i was up against big names in both the categories
3559204 they the contenders are all great actors i happened to win anyone else could have won as well
3559205 when i get a script it requires a lot of visualisation i have to ensure that seasoned actors like me can hold my own against younger and more versatile actors
3559206 my parents had a pineapple farm when i was younger and that was what inspired me to venture into the pineapple business
3559207 we are from batu pahat which is a popular place to cultivate pineapples so the business is close to our hearts
3559208 maybe because my booth is placed far from the main exhibition area so the visitors dont really get to see it
3559209 the josaphine pineapple is special because it is a crossbreed between the johor and sarawak pineapple
3559210 we also ferry the pineapples to the selayang market but during this exhibition period it will be available for sale here
3559211 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3559212 ivan has a wealth of experience having played at the highest level for many years and he can be a great asset for us
3559213 in the current social context practitioners are well versed on american cinema rather than about ours
3559214 globalisation has benefits and disadvantages it will be great if the exchange of all kinds of products get easier but with the important condition that this wont lead to one way traffic
3559215 sad but true i strongly feel that theres no specific and thorough co curriculum that can facilitate exchange of films and related products which can be passed on to the future generation
3559216 no one could give me straight answers when i queried about this
3559217 but i just cannot see myself as a lawyer surgeon or businessman even though this is where the money is
3559218 this line of work pays just enough to fill our rice bowls if you want to be rich be a businessman
3559219 we malaysians are not so good at r amp d but boy are we good salesmen

3559221 sen byron dorgan d n d said today that he wants 10 billion of u s funds that have been so far unpsent on iraqi reconstruction rescinded
3559222 today americans are paying sky high prices for oil and gas and at the same time the bush administration is continuing to spend billions of dollars a year for iraq reconstruction even though that country has huge budget surpluses
3559223 this is a big competition and its being held in china so there was a lot of pressure to perform at our best
3559224 it felt like the only people that believed in us was us
3559225 we will learn from the chinese and we will be up for the next challenge
3559226 do these things i say because im an important person
3559227 we invested some time in the run up to the festival making sure the flown enclosures were perfectly aimed and tuned
3559228 we were also using a cobra 2 system this year for the first time to provide side fill it was certainly worth the effort the cobra made a magnificent impression on everyone involved with the festival the sound quality the sound pressure levels and coverage were all one could wish for and the comments from the band engineers as well as the musicians regarding both the pa and the monitor sound was uniformly positive
3559229 it was chosen as it is a semi rural semi urban place two more locations will be identified one rural and the other urban
3559230 if it works we will also include other things not just essential items
3559231 when i first started talking about st15 rice only bangladeshis and mamak stall operators knew what it was
3559232 most people never knew it existed and others never thought that it would come to our cooking pots
3559233 it is ever more urgent that we investigate the possibility of a long term solution in the form of a new and more eco friendly international airport
3559234 the mayor is keen to know what the alternatives are to expansion at heathrow and would like to know whether the idea of a new airport in the thames estuary would be viable or not
3559235 he has asked officers to consider the feasibility of a new airport to see if the idea is worth further consideration
3559236 child protection policies in britain are poisoning the relationship between the generations
3559237 this is the best evidence to date that elite suppressors can have fully pathogenic virus
3559238 thats a good sign in terms of developing a therapeutic vaccine
3559239 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3559240 we are trying to figure out exactly how the t cells work in her to inhibit viral replication
3559241 we are just trying to see what kind of cytokines they make
3559242 si vabb ma sei fortunato hai una famiglia una casa hai la salute cosa che tanti altri non hanno

3559286 we continue to anticipate stable market conditions for our plasma therapies business and growing contribution from royalties associated with the international sales of gardasil
3559287 the acquisition will make csl a stronger competitor in the highly competitive plasma therapeutics market place
3559288 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3559289 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3559290 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3559291 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3559292 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3559293 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3559294 the governments scheme just wont work and i wasnt prepared to risk putting up fuel prices on the basis of overwhelming evidence
3559295 googles acquisition of begun is likely to significantly alter the advertising channel allowing google to enhance monetisation of its already significant 35 share of the
3559296 although google does not disclose information about its russian operations industry sources estimate that it had approximately 5 revenue share in 2006 and 2007 implying a search monetisation 4 7 times lower than that of yandex this appears to be caused by googles inability thus far to adjust to peculiarities of the russian payment system i e cash direct money transfer etc rather than cheques as well as the lack of a direct sales force this weakness was the key underpinning and rationale for the begun transaction

3559298 the bank advises that it has made this decision after its board assessed the current economic climate the uncertainty in world financial markets and the risks involved in integrating these complex businesses at this time

3559345 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3559346 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3559347 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3559348 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3559349 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3559350 its like riding a bicycle its like i never left

3559378 it is a neck and neck race between 2007 and this year over the issue of ice loss
3559379 we thought arctic ice cover might recover after last years unprecedented melting and indeed the picture didnt look too bad last month cover was significantly below normal but at least it was up on last year
3559380 but the beaufort sea storms triggered steep ice losses and it now looks as if it will be a very close call indeed whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for ice cover over the arctic we will only find out when the cover reaches its minimum in mid september
3559381 when we did the first climate change computer models we thought the arctics summer ice cover would last until around 2070
3559382 it is now clear we did not understand how thin the ice cap had already become for arctic ice cover has since been disappearing at ever increasing rates every few years we have to revise our estimates downwards now the most detailed computer models suggest the arctics summer ice is going to last for only a few more years and given what we have seen happen last week i think they are probably correct
3559383 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic ice
3559384 the crucial point is that ice is not building up enough over winter to restore cover and when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years and when that happens there will be consequences
3559385 we always knew it would be the first region on earth to feel the impact of climate change but not at anything like this speed

3559393 estamos igual que en el comienzo de atenas 2004 con un triunfo y una derrota
3559394 es un buen equipo s que hoy meti 20 triples de 31 intentos una locura pero no creo que puedan mantener ese promedio tan alto
3559395 one of the big reasons that new jersey has such outrageous spending and tax problems is because too many elected officials are voting to protect their financial interests not the interests of the people who elected them
3559396 the legislation i have introduced is intended to reduce the undue influence of the governing class class of political elites who have a vested interest in seeing more government spending and less government efficiency and responsibility
3559397 i do not comment on private matters regarding public officials
3559398 i believe the publics confidence is eroded to the point where he needs to address the allegations im willing to wait until after his medical leave but after that i want answers
3559399 wed like to hear more from bill and have an opportunity for him to address the board rather than continue this dialogue with the press
3559400 on chair bianes statements it is obvious that this is the genesis of a political coup detat it is also a shame that he continues to level personal attacks against an individual who is on a medical leave of absence
3559401 remember paul biane was the politician who attempted to secretly initiate a criminal inquiry into my office for self serving political gain
3559402 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3559403 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like its from another time
3559404 i promise you today that ill remind them of everything they have done and one day we will win
3559405 fully regained control over the upper part of the kodori gorge
3559406 barbarians look this is georgian democracy if it werent for russia we would have already been buried here
3559407 theres still some occasional sniper fire but we are finishing them off steadily and surely
3559408 its becoming almost like an arms race as to who can ban more things
3559409 san francisco bans plastic bags then la bans plastics then everyone else has to its ironic because the us was founded as a reaction to the colonists telling them what to do i mean hey when are we gonna start banning alcohol again
3559410 we are taking a strong step toward creating a healthier future for california
3559411 the government here in california is banning a food product simply because its not healthy
3559412 what do you ban next bacon fat the possibilities are limitless
3559413 an activist government that thinks it knows whats best for us
3559414 theyre banning fast food restaurants in parts of la because they think were too fat and therefore theyre gonna help us
3559415 trans fat raises bad cholesterol and lowers good cholesterol so yeah its a double whammy
3559416 but in two years time its gonna be a thing of the past not because of the government but because consumers are voting with their feet you dont need to criminalise it the government has created a dangerous precedent
3559417 the people who think they have the right to tell you what to do are usually the exact same people who drive around in suvs and drink bottled water every day
3559418 im pretty sure both of those things are very worst things you can do to the environment yet theyll go crazy if they see me stubbing out a cigarette butt in my own backyard
3559419 i think theres actually a little bit of one upmanship going on
3559420 the moderating effect of a democracy will always stop bad laws from happening
3559421 a great example of that was when the speed limit was rolled back to 55mph it got to the point where if you were sticking to it you were the slowest person on the road and youd be creating a hazard if a law is going to work people have to live up to it theres a great quote from calvin coolidge the 30th president of the us that good laws are not made theyre discovered
3559422 its truly up to bill postmus to step up and do the responsible thing
3559423 i do not comment on private matters regarding public officials
3559424 the county must resume the publics business without the ongoing distraction and erosion of the publics confidence being generated by these continuing and troubling questions about the assessors conduct
3559425 on chair bianes statements it is obvious that this is the genesis of a political coup detat
3559426 i just felt as the chairman when he speaks there is assumption that he speaks for the whole board
3559427 i strongly believe that we have a responsibility as a board to hold all of our elected officials accountable there is a process to do that
3559428 i think we need to be careful not to prejudice ourselves and prejudge i have not seen a credible source named to substantiate illegal drug use
3559429 it is very disturbing as it is for any other board member
3559430 if and when that is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt county assessor bill postmus must resign
3559431 i am the elected assessor having won over 100 000 votes in the most recent election for this position despite recent setbacks many accomplishments have been achieved for county taxpayers including the implementation of a tax law that saved 90 000 property owners 67 million

3559435 there is no business as usual in the connected era
3559436 boundaries for businesses are virtual this is a new class of worker who maybe doesnt have an office and who maybe visits 10 offices in a day and visits several different customers
3559437 the majority of people coming online and buying their first computer today are doing it in emerging countries like china india and brazil
3559438 if you look at india about 67 or more of their workforce is going to be entirely mobile and that is driving the demand for new features in the laptop like all day connectivity long battery life high level security and uncompromising design and durability
3559439 performance leaders and something the tech community will absolutely die for
3559440 with 17 000 notebooks being lost left unattended or reported missing at airports around the world many with important information on them our customers asked for the notion of a vault to secure their information
3559441 we have defined mobility for the business computer we are at that forefront of being different
3559442 i think what it comes down to is that for most of those customers highly mobile highly robust and highly secure systems are critical for large organisations ease of management and administration
3559443 i think what dell has done here is really very much focused on meeting the needs and wishes of this different class
3559444 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3559445 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3559446 iraq is a very wealthy country enormous oil reserves they can finance largely finance the reconstruction of their own country and i have no doubt that they will
3559447 when it comes to reconstruction before we turn to the american taxpayer we will turn first to the resources of the iraqi government and the international community
3559448 there is a lot of money to pay for this that doesnt have to be us taxpayer money and it starts with the assets of the iraqi people we are talking about a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
3559449 it is unimaginable that the united states would have to contribute hundreds of billions of dollars and highly unlikely that we would have to contribute even tens of billions of dollars
3559450 i will bet you the best dinner in the gaslight district of san diego that military action will not last more than a week are you willing to take that wager
3559451 what was perceived as a failure is not the school not the parents not the teachers not the students and it is not me
3559452 the bottom line is charter school law was not followed and oversight was not provided
3559453 he did not defraud swindle or steal from that school
3559454 minneapolis played no part in this until now when theyre going to take it away
3559455 this is not an easy decision it ticks me off that one person was able to affect 250 students
3559456 i know students who have been at heart of the earth for years
3559457 we would absolutely move to help those students find schools with help from the american indian community
3559458 they had been there since 2005 and no one knew it
3559459 the family has been held hostage by thurmond since they moved in
3559460 they were only allowed to stay for two hours and had to return home
3559461 we also tried to focus a little more on bringing characters back and not just from diablo ii but from diablo i
3559462 we feel like a lot of the focus is on diablo ii but diablo i started it all and has a lot of really good stuff on the gameplay side and on the character side so people can expect to see characters from diablo i more characters from diablo ii and characters from some of the books were definitely going to bring a few of them in

3559466 the key to every performance that goes on at the dallas opera has to be that it be a thrilling experience
3559467 rediscovering old music or uncovering some new 19th century piece or doing an operatic standard or a 21st century piece it doesnt matter it has to be riveting
3559468 the fact that im a musician makes me better at the job that i do
3559469 i relate to the programming in a very specific way i relate to the audiences and the donors and my fellow performers in a very specific way and i expect that that same thing will be true in dallas
3559470 this expansion wasnt big enough i finished it in two days
3559471 the games not as good as it used to be im outta here
3559472 we are heat is an age old problem for computers however what once used to be a concern primarily for cutting edge systems has now become an issue for everyone
3559473 oems developing high performance low noise systems require a safe thermal management solution that not only keeps their systems cool but is easy to install maintenance free and most important is virtually noise free
3559474 the days of computers that sound like jet aircraft taking off are over our award winning lclc provides worry free aggressive thermal management for advanced gaming and graphics intensive applications especially those using multiple gpus like amds latest r700 based graphics cards
3559475 the obvious approach to getting more of these compounds would be to genetically engineer plants to stop production along the pathway so that a particular intermediate would accumulate
3559476 people have tried this but with limited success if you knock out one enzyme you end up knocking out a large part of the pathway
3559477 now that we have access to intermediates that were not previously available people will want to do careful studies on their pharmacological activity
3559478 and we were getting yields of 100 to 200 milligrams per litre which is respectable for potentially valuable molecules with relatively simple optimization of the fermentation you could obtain 10 or 100 times more than this
3559479 its very exciting that plant alkaloid pathways are starting to be reconstituted in microbes very importantly smolke has also shown how this strain can be used to discover new enzymes that catalyse biosynthetic transformations
3559480 we are now hoping to extend the pathway both ways to get a broader range of intermediates downstream including the end products and to be able to start with simpler substrates upstream

3559482 we thought we would end the series with a light fun romantic comedy that is sure to entertain and delight our audiences
3559483 it has been a hit at festivals around the country and in its over seas release
3559484 ty liebermans script struck me as having the makings of a really fun romantic comedy i immediately loved the premise of the wedding movie with a twist
3559485 the situation in which these characters find themselves was compelling on the verge of marriage our groom must choose between his fianc e and his first love
3559486 i felt there was a delightful paradox in the fact that his first love was a man it is both crucial to the story and yet incidental this could happen to anyone thematically i liked how the screenplay took sexual identity out for a spin
3559487 think my best friends wedding with a sexual twist and you get the picture
3559488 the film is a lot of fun and a lot of laughs and our audience is on the guest list of a very funny wedding
3559489 well here i am what are your other two wishes
3559490 it is not hard to reach the top the hard part is staying there
3559491 it is clear that long term leadership requires continuous innovation

3559519 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3559520 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3559521 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3559522 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3559523 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3559524 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3559525 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
3559526 ms brown is it possible you have a history of perceiving things entirely different than they really happened
3559527 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand

3559531 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3559532 there is accountability through the contract and to the contracting officer
3559533 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3559534 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3559535 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3559536 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3559537 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3559538 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3559539 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3559540 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3559541 imposing house arrest and suspending the fourth amendment for law abiding people is only going to cause more problems for this city
3559542 they need to work with the community to get this resolved instead of treating all of their citizens like criminals

3559557 state attorneys general received thousands of consumer complaints of online fraud and abuse in 2006 and 2007 and yet with the exception of several notable standouts brought few significant cases in response according to a report released today from the center for american progress and the center for democracy and technology

3559560 remember san jacinta you pinchey gringos la raza reconquista but please pay for the birth of my 14 year old sisters 2nd child
3559561 im just trying to get my foot in the door trying to turn some heads
3559562 i think ive progressed well up to this point i think theyre looking for me to keep progressing and show that i can become an nfl quarterback
3559563 its probably not going to happen right away i realize that i just have to keep working hard
3559564 thatll prepare you well for the adversity that youll face in this league
3559565 my junior year i put a lot on my back and blamed myself for a lot of things going wrong but youve got to realize its a team game
3559566 at the same time you still have to realize your mistakes but you also have to not worry about what other people are saying
3559567 hes shown very good poise while hes here intelligence hes picked things up very quickly he throws a real nice deep ball
3559568 going in i wasnt sure how i was going to play if it was going to be extremely fast but it turned out ok for me
3559569 and i still have a lot of room to improve
3559570 misty and i absolutely want to win a gold medal and then start a family
3559571 i have so much love to give and i just want to share it
3559572 i love my job i love my lifestyle im offering my unlimited babysitting services to may treanor
3559573 babe im so excited for you to accomplish one dream in beijing and then we can start on a new dream
3559574 it just didnt make any sense to try to squeeze one out between olympics
3559575 this is going to be very good for all of the receivers not just roy and calvin
3559576 this is going to really open things up because teams are going to have to pay attention to the run and try to stop roy and calvin
3559577 when a team starts to be able to dominate the line and run the ball you can see the way it changes the chemistry and the energy levels thats what we have to have
3559578 the hardest part is all the practices without any games now that we have started playing games were almost home
3559579 so we must be careful and take this game seriously we took odense seriously in the and that is how we should always be
3559580 so i said well wed better get him out here manny was still getting on me about it today
3559581 i was sitting there and when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3559582 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3559583 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3559584 i mean weve had to wait for guys if theyve had a piece of equipment break or snap a jock or something and had to go change it was just one of those things it certainly wasnt intentional we werent trying to delay the game in any way not that we wont get a letter because we delayed the game
3559585 ive seen him for a long time and i knew when he came over here that his mind was going to be in the right place and he was going to play like i know he can
3559586 this is what you get on a nightly basis in every single game hes done something positive to help us win
3559587 its been a long time since this city especially the dodgers have seen a bona fide everyday superstar
3559588 now theyre seeing it and how he can change a game
3559589 hes a lot of fun but youve got to really get to know him
3559590 i mean when they say mannys being manny i mean hes a much nicer person than people would think
3559591 cant stop wont stop a history of the hip hop generation
3559592 r 16 is recognized i think as one of the top b boy events in the world and i think for good reason
3559593 and so i think the excitement around r 16 in the world has to do with the fact that it just seems that this korea right now is the place to be if you want to know whats at the cutting edge of hip hop and whats at the cutting edge of the dance forms i think for instance in the united states over the last two years there have been all these dance competitions that have been going on there is this huge craze for dance and at the same time thats created a hunger for the real thing and i think this is the epitome of the real thing
3559594 i think its a combination of the fact that these are crews that are fiercely and intensely competitive
3559595 its always been a grass roots movement thats been about allowing people to express themselves in the deepest kind of way
3559596 es importante en unidad ir hacia la aprobaci n de la constituci n pol tica del estado

3559604 unfortunately just as borers emerge from the tree bark unscrupulous businesses will likely emerge to take money from innocent victims
3559605 do not hire a business that comes to your door to solicit business
3559606 we have seen this happen in parts of wisconsin that are infested with gypsy moth
3559607 if you are a property owner who wants to begin protecting your trees do your homework so you dont get taken by businesses who are more interested in getting at your money instead of the ash boring beetle
3559608 insecticides may help protect ash trees from being killed by eab but their success is not guaranteed there is no magic bullet
3559609 establishing this quarantine is an important first step to combat eab
3559610 eab can travel only so far on its own but the beetle can travel great distances if it is unknowingly transported inside logs mulch or firewood
3559611 el xito de la operaci n no cambia la naturaleza del gobierno colombiano
3559612 conviene advertir de entrada que mal que le pese al gobierno y a sus fuerzas armadas y qui n sabe si a la propia se ora betancourt a ojos del m s desprevenido la libertad de los rehenes fue producto de una negociaci n dineraria si no con la c pula subversiva s con los carceleros c sar y gafas alistados al efecto con tecnolog a extranjera
3559613 con este hecho el gobierno colombiano afect gravemente la credibilidad de quienes en el futuro porten tales insignias es decir el gobierno pas de preferir el sacrificio de un grupo de secuestrados en aras de toda una naci n antigua premisa al favorecimiento de 15 de ellos en desprecio de la vida del resto de secuestrados que a n permanecen en poder de las farc de todas las personas que trabajan en el cicr y otros organismos de ayuda y de todos los militares y civiles que dependen del voluntariado de estas ongs para su supervivencia que en colombia con un 10 de su poblaci n v ctima del desplazamiento interno y un conflicto que a diario deja ca dos y lesionados en combate de ambos bandos nos da un resultado de varios millones de personas
3559614 nosotros no estamos en algo pol tico estamos en un referendo constitucional en el cual los ciudadanos participan sin ning n car cter pol tico esto se llama democracia participativa
3559615 centenares de secuestrados en poder de las farc y el eln
3559616 lo que se necesita es un acuerdo humanitario no estos actos politiqueros en medio de la pol tica guerrerista del presidente y con tantos shows en que nos utilizan para seguir enga ando al mundo
3559617 l a visibilidad que internacionalmente han recibido las pugnas del presidente con las cortes los v nculos de una gran parte de miembros de la coalici n de gobierno con el paramilitarismo la condena a una ex congresista por haber aceptado prebendas a cambio de su voto de aprobaci n a la reelecci n presidencial inmediata y sobre todo la intenci n de uribe de volver a cambiar la constituci n para hacerse reelegir por segunda vez ha n terminado por sembrar grandes dudas sobre el car cter democr tico que tiene su tarea pacificadora
3559618 sin menoscabar la libertad de prensa la independencia del poder judicial la oposici n parlamentaria y extraparlamentaria
3559619 adem s que es la misma pol tica de seguridad democr tica la que ha propiciado el aumento de las violaciones de los derechos humanos ya que en muchas oportunidades son los agentes del estado quienes agraden a la poblaci n civil

3559622 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid

3559624 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it
3559625 they didnt even get the numbers right so i dont know if its about the money either
3559626 i must have come out of the womb looking like this
3559627 cash and i have been glued to the olympics how amazing was the opening ceremony i still dont know how they co ordinated 2008 people to move in perfect sync
3559628 the mens 400m relay was insane we were down by almost a half body length going into the final turn and then next thing you knew it was closer closer closer until we touched the wall first cash and i went crazy
3559629 i have nothing to hide theres no sex tape with me and some guy doing anything lewd so im not even worried about that
3559630 im only worried about my family who is most important in all of this my parents raised me well and i would never shame them like that or make a video like that
3559631 ive never even been intimate with anyone to be quite honest believe me i havent even gotten to that stage yet
3559632 this is just another way hes making history and we want to be part of it
3559633 i was so nervous i dont know if i saw it really well but i think its a good likeness

3559641 i would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you who are genuinely concerned about reginae and her safety
3559642 please allow me to dispel any rumors or speculations and report that my daughter is alive healthy and surrounded by family who care and love her dearly
3559643 the rumors are completely false and unfounded neither reginae nor any other member of my family has been involved in any car accident

3559652 while very good research work produced a list of seven possible names for the men dna matching techniques were only able to confirm the identity of two of the five prior to the re burial ceremony with full military honours last year
3559653 confirmation of george storeys identification was made using dna together with compelling historical research
3559654 it has been a long arduous process but now pte storeys place of burial is known to his country and most importantly his family
3559655 the olympics is the biggest event in world sport and seven is doing a magnificent job in bringing the action home to australians
3559656 we are delighted that we can work with seven and foxtel to achieve the best result for as many people as possible
3559657 cristinas idea that only unfulfilled love could be romantic is sad
3559658 her notion that love has to be this complicated and tumultuous tug of war to be real that seems so exhausting to me
3559659 i could really appreciate her seize the day attitude she is so open to life and all of its adventures and all of its quirks and ready to go along for the ride i think thats the most attractive part of her character
3559660 as far as getting into bed with a stranger and all of that its nice to think that wouldnt end like disaster maybe ive watched too many of a amp es true crime series the first 48 to know what it could end up as but i think its very idyllic i think that part of me is that way
3559661 my mom is a romantic person and i think i inherited that from her there are many different ways that you can be romantic theres of course the romance that you have with your partner your love and then theres that thoughtfulness that you have with others remembering what people like and what they appreciate and wanting them to experience it and enjoy it thats romantic to me in a way
3559662 if you need dramatic shes dramatic if you need a laugh she can get a laugh she can sing if you need it shes sexy shes intelligent and that face on the screen she is so photogenic its paralyzing there is no limit for her
3559663 i had kate winslet for match point to the last week of pre production
3559664 i had to get somebody fairly quickly and i didnt know scarlett from a hole in the wall i thought she was too young to play the part she was only 19 at the time but then i hired her and became totally captivated by her
3559665 i havent even thought about it yet im still just enjoying the excitement of it but im sure that it will be as private as possible
3559666 it was the perfect time to do this and they dont have to pay for advertising and promotion and they need that
3559667 he came and shook my hand and i guess he was mad cause i called myself the president im the president of h town i run this city after we shook our hands and had our words i went my way and the next thing you know he snuck up behind me and hit me on my side
3559668 then someone else jumped in and tried to hit me in my nose but i still got up there on the ozone awards and performed
3559669 its gonna get handled in the streets i came to the ozone awards for my song cutty buddy and he came from behind my back like a coward its sad we have to talk about this

3559674 jericho being thrown into a match with kane for no reason halts the momentum from the months of great character building
3559675 when has the wwe ever made jericho look good for more than one minute before digging his grave the next
3559676 i wonder if target is going to start selling burlap sacks for their back to school sale ridiculous stuff
3559677 its so b movie bad that you cant help but laugh at it
3559678 i am not sure how others will feel but striker was money on commentary for me
3559679 cole describing cenas style as pound and ground is ridiculous on so many levels
3559680 i am yet to watch a single wwe show where punk is treated like a top guy
3559681 raw was not just bad it was a i cant believe this made it on air type of bad
3559682 todd grisham did fine as play by play and tazz seemed to enjoy working with him
3559683 of all the talent they could have used they select the most talentless individual in the company
3559684 everyone is complaining about the announcement of mike adamle as the new raw g m but i think its a great idea
3559685 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
3559686 jericho being thrown into a match with kane for no reason halts the momentum from the months of great character building
3559687 when has the wwe ever made jericho look good for more than one minute before digging his grave the next
3559688 i wonder if target is going to start selling burlap sacks for their back to school sale ridiculous stuff
3559689 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
3559690 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
3559691 jericho being thrown into a match with kane for no reason halts the momentum from the months of great character building
3559692 when has the wwe ever made jericho look good for more than one minute before digging his grave the next
3559693 i wonder if target is going to start selling burlap sacks for their back to school sale ridiculous stuff
3559694 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
3559695 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3559696 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3559697 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3559698 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3559699 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3559700 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3559701 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3559702 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together

3559718 whenever you have a street in lexington youve got to give it a name
3559719 ive been i dont know how many years in this old bottom
3559720 we have some people who are undecided about whether they will go or stay
3559721 we will have room for all of those families who choose to stay
3559722 if we cant distribute our publications thats in effect prior restraint
3559723 i would call it a very ugly scar in our downtown when you come up on these rainbows of colors shapes and sizes
3559724 youve got accessibility issues for handicapped folks youve got mobility issues
3559725 the color of the racks is part of our brand our racks are branded blue and we want to maintain that brand
3559726 one of the biggest eyesores in my estimation and in many peoples estimation has been the indiscriminate placing of newspaper racks
3559727 does this offend you 62 what then if you should see the son of man ascend where he was before 63 it is the spirit who gives life the flesh profits nothing the words that i speak to you are spirit and they are life 64 but there are some of you who do not believe
3559728 therefore i have said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by my father
3559729 lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life 69 also we have come to believe and know that you are the christ the son of the living god

3559731 we australia do stand to render any assistance if that will help in terms of ceasefire and also in terms of humanitarian assistance because we do have regrettably very many displaced people
3559732 we will give serious consideration to anything we can do on the humanitarian front
3559733 there are indications that georgia asked a range of nation states including australia to consider military assistance
3559734 australia indicated at officials levels that we werent interested in providing military assistance
3559735 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3559736 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3559737 we are proceeding and the president is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3559738 morgan tsvangirai is the main opposition leader and any agreement that doesnt include his party will not work for the country it actually just complicates issues
3559739 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3559740 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3559741 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3559742 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3559743 it became abundantly clear that this isnt going to work at all for consumers
3559744 the big issue here is you need to have competition amongst the big four oil companies thats where the problem is
3559745 the governments scheme just wont work and i wasnt prepared to risk putting up fuel prices on the basis of overwhelming evidence
3559746 among the most fundamental of these challenges is the need to restore americas international legitimacy to address the pervasive perception in the world that americas interests as america conceives of and pursues those interests today no longer reflect what the founders referred to as a decent respect for the opinions of mankind
3559747 international education forms the foundation for addressing these challenges and it is an indispensable component of the revived public diplomacy that must begin to rebuild americas global reputation
3559748 i would like to do or have this but i cant because
3559749 people are always blaming circumstance for what they are i do not believe in circumstance the people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstance they want and if they cant find them they make them

3559758 the positive is you can get off to a good start the negative is you have to make those games up on the road itll be crucial we take care of business those eight then be prepared to go on the road and have a chance to equalize that at some point you dont expect to go undefeated at home and you dont expect to go winless on the road
3559759 we are all extremely excited to get underway with our second nba d league season this november
3559760 once again the vipers are committed to entertaining our fans with high quality basketball and exciting family entertainment
3559761 i think whats going to be great about our schedule is it gives an opportunity for coach moser to get his feet wet at home and have the advantage of starting off at home
3559762 and it gives us the opportunity to bring out the things weve been working so hard on in the summer the entertainment factor right off the bat
3559763 we try to prevent any accidents from happening by advising our drivers to follow state law

3559766 because ive decided to do right by god and that means i have to repent from the things ive been doing that i know are not of god
3559767 you have got to be kidding me if youre trying to be all righteous and shit then why do you want to have sex with me one last time shouldnt you just leave me alone and quit me cold turkey
3559768 yes i should but i love you and letting you go is hard for me

3559772 last time you didnt take me seriously you played on my weakness and i ended up giving in to you but this time is different this williams

3559783 most of the video cards i have looked at lately have a good bit of headroom for the enthusiast crowd i was expecting the hd 4870x2 to offer that same level of overhead for overclocking the hd 4870x2 gave up a little bit of love but not as much as i had hoped for 55mhz on the gpu cores and 50mhz on the gddr5 memory both pretty low numbers when you consider that this video card is an enthusiast level card i suspect that heat is the main culprit in limiting the overclocking here with temperatures in the range of 90 degrees celsius heat is a major concern and may ultimately be the problem to solve to get more overhead at 955mhz on the memory i ended up with large colored blotches on the screen at 950mhz the problem disappeared on the gpu cores once i got over 805mhz i was greeted with lockups and reboots setting up a profile in the catalyst control center and modifying the xml file for the profile did not help as it has with the 4850 and 4870 video cards the fan speed never changed so i was left with a hot card and no way to cool it down any more than the drivers would allow as with any piece of hardware your mileage may vary knowing what my limits were on the clock speeds i decided to see how much the cpu clock speed was impacting performance so i pulled the q9450 and put in my trusty qx9770 to get some real clock speed to find out what kind of performance difference the cpu makes at 400x10 the performance did not let me down in 3dmark06 at the default 1280x1024 resolution the combo did not disappoint 22520 was the score i achieved

3559795 we found that the oil and gas blocks overlap perfectly with the most biodiverse part of the amazon for birds mammals and amphibians
3559796 the threat to amphibians is of particular concern because they are already the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide
3559797 the most dynamic situation is unfolding in the peruvian amazon
3559798 the elimination of new oil access roads could significantly reduce the impacts of most projects
3559799 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3559800 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognize that indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent

3559838 viread will be an important new treatment option and its approval represents a significant step forward in the fight against chronic hepatitis b
3559839 the approval of viread for hepatitis b represents more than a decade of work in both the fields of hiv and hepatitis b to develop a medication that offers significant viral suppression once daily dosing and a well established safety profile
3559840 we extend our thanks to the investigators and patients who participated in the clinical trials that support todays approval and we look forward to partnering with community members to increase disease awareness and expand access to treatment for those patients in need
3559841 although weve made great strides in reducing the overall incidence of chronic hepatitis b in the united states the disease still takes a devastating toll in asian american communities
3559842 greater public awareness and effective new treatment options are urgently needed to help reduce this significant health disparity

3559907 in reimagining church frank viola is at the top of his game showing a serene soaring mastery of the theology of church as organism rather than organization
3559908 dissent is a gift to the church it is the imagination of the prophets that continually call us back to our identity as the peculiar people of god may violas words challenge us to become the change that we want to see in the church and not to settle for anything less than gods dream for her
3559909 true to form this book contains a thoroughly consistent critique of prevailing forms of church however in reimagining church frank viola also presents a positive vision of what the church can become if we truly reembraced more organic and less institutional forms of church this is a no holds barred prophetic vision for the church in the twenty first century
3559910 for those who are not threatened by the idea that church must change reimagining church is an absolutely timely and much needed perspective delivering a solid biblical vision for the body of christ
3559911 if pagan christianity exposes the reality that much of our current church practice has little basis in the bible reimagining church takes the next step to establish what truly biblical church life looks like with the inner life of the trinity as the starting point viola paints an amazing picture of organic church life
3559912 if we are indeed at the cusp of the next major reformation of the church as many suggest then frank viola is one of the significant voices we all should lend our ears to franks humble heart and bold keyboard have once again delivered a book to be read by those who desire to take an honest look at the state of the contemporary church reimagining church calls us to first remember the church from the original blueprint of scripture
3559913 i kind of had the idea of how like jesus is like a gas mask that we put on to filter out all of the crap thats in the world
3559914 i have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral or the greedy and swindlers or idolaters in that case you would have to leave this world

3559917 what buck had done he was much more than a country music singer
3559918 he did so much for this community he chose to live here he didnt live some where else the quality of life he helped out financially and nobody knows it
3559919 how could we have blasted those poor souls into outer space to accomplish a strategic mission of international importance without preparing for this undertaking more effectively what were we thinking who would have ever imagined this sort of thing could ever happen they should have never launched this mission we should have stayed home
3559920 it is quite astounding that although protestant and catholic churches have raised and spent close to one trillion dollars on domestic ministry during the past two decades there has been no measurable increase in one of the expressed purposes of the church to lead people to christ and have them commit their lives to him
3559921 we are not known for the depth of our transparency for digging in and solving deep seated problems but for trying to project an unchristian picture of having it all together
3559922 it is our belief that one of the core tasks of missional leadership is to assist the church to find new forms and expressions of church or bear the responsibility for the churchs effective extinction in our day
3559923 obviously its anything but business as usual on the demographic front each of us is challenged to rethink what it means to be a christian in 21st century america
3559924 we no longer need to imagine that god dwells in special places like sanctuaries church buildings temples or tabernacles
3559925 put the m in the equation first and the ec will follow
3559926 too often we see academic theology doing very little to actually impact practice on the ground
3559927 ones life begins to slope downward when one becomes an
3559928 ground control this is major tom get us back to earth would ya we want to get home is this stuff the best you can up with how long is it going to take to restore the functionality of the c module so we can get on with this mission were running low on oxygen and its getting awfully warm and stuffy in here
3559929 the current church culture in north america is on life support
3559930 with christians now largely indistinguishable from non christians in how they live and think there is no longer a startling freshness to the proclamation of biblical truth when it is presented as principles and propositions
3559931 what is needed is a revolution within the christian faith a complete upheaval of those christian practices that are contrary to biblical principle
3559932 we christians cannot continue to avoid knowing what we already know that something is rotten in the state of our religion
3559933 perhaps becoming what you believe is a process that necessarily involves shedding beliefs that are no longer becoming
3559934 we must therefore never underestimate our power to be wrong when talking about god when thinking about god when imagining god whether in prose or in poetry
3559935 orthodoxy or right opinion is at best a very slender part of religion
3559936 we cant keep comparing our best to their worst and feeling smug
3559937 love is an action love is something we do for others
3559938 what i believe is not what i say i believe what i believe is what i do
3559939 i simply do not believe that we can continue to try and think our way into a new way of acting but rather we need to act our way into a new way of thinking
3559940 discontinuous change is disruptive and unanticipated it creates situations that challenge our assumptions
3559941 what is at stake is the expansion of the movement which in this case is the fulfillment of the great commission
3559942 unchristian reflecting outsiders most common reaction to the faith they think christians no longer represent what jesus had in mind that christianity in our society is not what it was meant to be
3559943 how can people love god whom they cant see if those of us who claim to represent him dont respond to outsiders with love
3559944 perhaps many more people would be open to what jesus offers if his followers werent so bent on requiring you to clean up your act as a prerequisite for receiving it
3559945 we must move to the other side we cannot return to the c module
3559946 as we move to the other side our greatest enemy will not be our ignorance it will be our unteachability
3559947 this wont be an easy journey even after we have dismounted from the old dead horse
3559948 a total renovation of our imagination our way of looking at things is what jesus commanded in his no nonsense imperative
3559949 renewal movements are often led by people with no recognized formal leadership status in the church
3559950 a growing number of people are leaving the institutional church for a new reason they are not leaving the church because they have lost their faith they are leaving to preserve their faith
3559951 these are the names of all members of our church who died in the service
3559952 which service the 9 a m or the 11 a m
3559953 we know a young man and we believe hes demon possessed we are in our twenties and we are inexperienced at casting out demons can pastor fielding or assistant pastor melvin help him
3559954 hes been to a psychiatrist but its not solved the problem we are convinced that the problem is spiritual and not physical or mental
3559955 no hes not but if someone from your church can set him free we will join your church were in our twenties and we want to learn how to help people like this so if someone in your church can minister healing and deliverance to him you will have at least two new members
3559956 im sorry but if hes not a member of our church we cannot help him
3559957 derick will be delivered and were going to learn how to cast out demons hot dog
3559958 lord we have no idea what were doing but you said these signs shall follow them that believe they shall cast out demons in my name lord we believe
3559959 dont say that no dont say that he belongs to us you have no right to do this hes ours we live here dont say that shut up
3559960 we adjure you by the blood of jesus christ and by the name of jesus christ of nazareth come out of him
3559961 don this is jesus i love you why do you keep running from me
3559962 as i expected you came to your position primarily through your bad church experience
3559963 most of the critical comments on this post seem to come from people who have not read
3559964 ever since the inhabitants of babel erected a tower to reach to the heavens civilizations have followed suit by building structures with pointed tops
3559965 as for god allowing his people to steer so far afield of the truth one has only to look at the jewish religion in christs day to answer that question

3559972 i dont think its feasible in the foreseeable future tocontrol a local bank
3559973 coming into the job i thought in my mind that the mainopportunities were going to be in china india indonesia andthe other bigger markets
3559974 but the main surprise forme strategically is that we have a lot more to do insingapore and hong kong our core markets
3559975 its the most exciting thing on the horizon and its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3559976 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their heads and having writers on board and producers that are into it its been a fun thing
3559977 but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right
3559978 the thing is were on the warped tour now and weve never played warped before and were not like a typical warped band but i guess a lot of kids asked us to be there
3559979 so were playing the mosh set on warped because we want to make sure the kids get to beat the sh out of each other because we know thats what they like to do
3559980 when you think warped you dont think of a band like us
3559981 we wear a lot of bright clothes we shake our butts a lot were very sarcastic were electronic usually warped is about the mosh but the truth is the scene is changing a lot these days and what unites all the bands on warped isnt a specific musical sound but its more of an ethic there are so many different types of bands on warped i cant tell you how surprised i am to have made friends with some of these bands that i thought were totally going to think were pu s like story of the year i just thought theyd hate us they listen to metal they have tattoos and were best buds on this tour the common thread of warped is the ethic
3559982 use correct grammar lest ye desire to tarnish my good name
3559983 the internet community has become very polarized either you liked this book or you hated this book we took a stance that if you liked the book were going to be a place for discussion about that
3559984 we know that it was a disgruntled fan of the series who hacked our system it took place as a direct result of the lexicons backing of stephenie meyer and her work
3559985 if you were posting on every thread on our forums stephenie meyer is a terrible writer everything about it is horrible then we just arent the place for you
3559986 as her official fan site this needs to be a positive place where we can gather together and discuss what we like and have positive conversation hate spam makes it very difficult for someone to enjoy the site
3559987 if you hit the site with enough traffic its security measures begin to fall the message board had been spammed and it allowed a hole in the security net that somebody was able to get through and delete forums
3559988 because of the spamming there were so many ip addresses there is no shortage of suspects and no way to know which one exactly did the attack
3559989 the hole that enabled them to get into the blog has been sealed as far as contacting law enforcement we have been in contact with our server company and there are definite measures being taken to ensure that this doesnt happen again
3559990 its a very difficult time for the fandom in that you liked it or you really hated it everyone feels like they need to get their say but that means that the fans that really liked it need to have their site too the blog is that place for these ladies and a few men who have been worshipping this book for years
3559991 for those who were disappointed go be passionate about something else
3559992 the only rapper that could still get money in the drought
3559993 and i chill with the thugs and the gangsters too i aint a blood but im warring with the boys in blue crooked officer crooked officer why you wanna see me in a coffin sir
3559994 seen you jockin j c cause he got a mercedes and you know about his ladies
3559995 for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3559996 im ok with it my voice was used in the performance i think thats enough
3559997 well then you havent really traveled the globe mr g
3559998 i had visions that they would give me tips to help me with the languages the alphabets the dress the food shit
3559999 coach just because she looks like a girl does not really mean that she is a girl
