470003 what we learn will not change the fact that this has been a poorly handled investigation that has lasted 6 years and already has resulted in a trail of embarrassment and personal tragedy
470004 its curious if hardly surprising that none of the major outlets reporting the news bothered to note that the attacks were all made on perceived
470005 no i didnt i didnt know what his affiliations where and thats a good question
470006 the work became even more intense in the aftermath of the 2001 anthrax attack as the field grew tremendously with billions my caps in new federal support for research on anthrax and other potential biological weapons my caps and to buy new drugs or vaccines to handle a possible future attack
470007 and to create new weapons for use in a possible future attack by the us military
470008 we have a fragmented and underfunded public health system at the local state and federal level that does not allow us to effectively detect and track disease outbreaks in real time
470009 dark winter showed just how unprepared we are to deal with bioterrorism
470010 it pointed out that there were significant challenges to all levels of government
470011 an outside panel of experts provided guidance to niaid on its biodefense research agenda and identified the insufficient amount of biosafety level 3 bsl 3 and bsl 4 lab space as a significant barrier to progress
470012 to know that we can do this research and not do it would be irresponsible
470013 primarily on the scientific and technical merit of the applications as assessed by peer review and on the bus ability to contribute to the overall niaid
470014 i am thrilled with the national institutes of healths decision to designate boston and bu medical center as an national biocontainment laboratory site
470015 bostons role as a center of bio medical and research activity
470016 its a very important part of our efforts in the state to be on the cutting edge of research
470017 the construction of this new center will solidify massachusetts position as the national leader for cutting edge biotech research it will generate 1 300 construction jobs 660 new permanent positions and countless other economic opportunities for local businesses and residents
470018 bu removed or penciled over a number of lines in the response to the federal government that is even though they handed a copy to ace and to others they made it impossible for some of it to be read because they said that was confidential information
470019 they demonstrated something very important to us and that is the ability to infiltrate and take deadly materials out of those laboratories and to escape detection
470020 we have seen these incidents happen around the world and with the tularemia incident in 2002 and 2004 and not to mention the mercury spills and the contamination of water 9 11 the mail issue with anthrax being mailed there are too many things that are happening now that put doubt in your mind about how secure is this lab

470031 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
470032 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
470033 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
470034 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who should be replaced and who should be appointed to which position
470035 in america they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
470036 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic

470043 the most encouraging thing is she has been listened to
470044 i think theres a recognition she has a lot of supporters out there and they need to reach out as shes reaching out to him obama
470045 weve worked together and there are a number of clinton supporters on the platform committee itself
470046 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
470047 i think they are cynical i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
470048 the one thing we know about the team that john mccains assembled because its a carryover from some of the folks that worked on bush campaigns and some of the republican campaigns in the past is that theyre very good at negative campaigns theyre not so good at governing
470049 we dont take the skill of the republicans in engaging in negative attacks lightly we think its something that weve got to be mindful of but what we also have confidence in is that the american people feel that were offering real solutions
470050 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama who has opposed every element of john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling affordable nuclear energy and gas tax relief for hardworking families
470051 i dont know that theres that perception thats something thats being fed to the media by them i get no sense that its taken
470052 i think what would be useful is to ask the question whats this based on its not really clear exactly what its based on

470082 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
470083 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
470084 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
470085 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
470086 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy

470133 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run
470134 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
470135 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office say barack obama or harold ford the opposition feels compelled to run low life political ads featuring tacky sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates
470136 senator obama brought up the issue of race i responded to it im disappointed and i dont want that issue to be part of this campaign
470137 we had a meeting last monday with gareth and his agent at which we all agreed we would have a 5pm deadline on wednesday
470138 if liverpool had not proved they had the wherewithal to proceed with the transfer deal then we would all leave that aside and go on with it
470139 i was hoping that would be the case and this was not a matter of liverpool missing the deadline by 15 minutes as seems to have been reported
470140 liverpool first showed their interest in signing gareth barry almost four months ago so this is not a case of missing a deadline by 15 minutes thats simply not true
470141 the following morning we were very upbeat on the strength of what had happened on wednesday evening we were very buoyant and optimistic that everything could come back to normal again
470142 that wasnt to be though on thursday there was a meeting between gareths agent myself and the player they still felt that even though the deadline had passed liverpool were going to come in and do the deal
470143 obviously i was disappointed to hear that gareths head is a bit all over the place at the moment and they asked for some more time
470144 so ive listened to what theyve said and ill go with it reluctantly but ill go with it there will be no deadline and liverpool have all the time in the world now to sign gareth barry theyve got up to the normal window which is the 31st of this month
470145 so its really up to them gareth and his agent to sort it out ive decided this is the only way forward for us really
470146 i have a football club to run and i really do want people who want to play for us if liverpool at the end of it all do not come up with the money thats no one elses fault but their own
470147 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
470148 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each
470149 the doctrine of justification by faith is in fact the great ecumenical doctrine
470150 the gospel portrait implies that jesus would be found guilty by the self conscious religious majority of any age and background
470151 i have a preview of my new book from slg i can run and fetch you a copy

470154 there is time enough for everything in the course of a day if we do but one thing at a time but there is not time enough in a year if we try to do two things at a time
470155 but we must learn to let go to relax completely before each period of in tense concentration here is the working principle relaxation precedes perfect concentration a delightful illustration of this point is given by elizabeth towne six puppies were playing in the barn the barn door was closed and with the world shut out they were giving themselves up completely to the spirit of play two of them were staging a mock battle over a feather while the others were rolling over and over in the loose straw on the barn floor in utter enjoyment suddenly the barn door softly creaked instantly every puppy came to attention heads up tails up bodies rigid bright eyes fixed in intense concentration on that door as it slowly swung open a moment before they had been in a state of complete relaxation now they offered a perfect example of concentration as they stood at attention waiting and watching for the unknown danger that might be coming from the other side of the barn door all great mental achievement has been preceded by periods of absolute rest or relaxtion during this time fatigue disappears the nervous forces recuperate and the minds stores up fresh energy axed establishes a reserve to draw upon during
470156 of relaxation will which he pointed out that continual tress and strain high tension without periods relaxation were responsible for much chronic fatigue and many a nervous breakdown
470157 solitude is to genius the stern friend the cold obscure shelter where mould the wings which will bear it farther than suns or stars
470158 silence is the element in which great things fashion themselves together that at length they may emerge full formed and mamestic into the delight of life which they are henceforth to rule
470159 what a college and a crowd could not do for thousands of young men solitude did for the son alone he sailed the seas of thought with god for his only companion till at last he stood forth a mountain minded man
470160 we showed we could block behavior in mice that resembles this increased euphoria even after the animals had been given a lot of alcohol
470161 thats what you want in a treatment because we dont get to people until after they become addicted to alcohol
470162 i think if you block this receptor you might be able to decrease drinking in response to ptsd
470163 it has some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan to move us in the direction of genuine energy independence
470164 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions but i will give them the bills drafters credit that the way they crafted the drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect for a drilling agenda
470165 what i will not do and this has been my position is to support a plan that suggests drilling is the answer to our energy problems
470166 if we have a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like i would consider it because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
470167 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
470168 if congress does not act they will owe families across america an explanation for why theyre ignoring their concerns
470169 senator obama says he wants energy independence but he doesnt support anything that serves that goal he is opposed to new domestic drilling opposed to nuclear power and wants to add taxes to coal producers he has said the high cost of gasoline doesnt bother him only that it rose too quickly
470170 we need to start drilling and producing more oil at home and bring down the cost of gasoline that is killing our economy
470171 that i think is the kind of bold step that we need the fact that they are willing to put in seven billion dollars to help the auto industry retool so that those new energy efficient cars are made in america
470172 what i dont want to do is to be the enemy of the good here
470173 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept things i dont like and change for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence then that is something im open to
470174 to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering
470175 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good

470180 the team deserve it and i think me and heikki have been pushing hard so we both deserve it
470181 i have a bit of time in the bag still the car was great sector 1 was very strong and when i got to turn 4 the quick left was fine and when i got back to turn 5 i locked up the right front wheel and it pushed me on a bit
470182 it might be half a tenth or a tenth but it is all important luckily i could save it and the rest of lap was good heikki was quickest in final sector so he is pushing me hard
470183 i feel safe to be in the position i am in we have speed to push on and challenge for the win tomorrow is another day and ill make sure i do the preparations tonight and tomorrow morning

470246 my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
470247 el declive fue principalmente atribuible a la gran debilidad del mercado estadounidense y la p rdida de producci n debido a los paros en american axle y varias instalaciones de gm durante mayo y junio
470248 estamos reaccionando r pidamente a los desaf os que encara la econom a estadounidense y el mercado del autom vil y seguiremos tomando las agresivas medidas necesarias para transformar nuestras operaciones en estados unidos

470253 i know the effort of the people that are in the front office trying to do whats best not only for the team but for the organization at this point
470254 i think they take all those things into consideration i dont have any problem with that ive been on teams where people hold you hostage because you are where you are and you have what you have you just have to be careful a lot of times they say the best trades that you make are the ones you didnt make
470255 i dont like to bring a kid if the matchup is not favorable for him id like to get something that appears favorable its still the major leagues dont get me wrong anybody can look favorable but it can be dangerous because you are in the major leagues
470256 i love to look at young players no question about that i enjoy it i would like that but at the same time there has to be a real good chance to feel like we could win

470283 direitos humanos se tornaram mais do que uma teoria para a sociedade
470284 no passado as pessoas protestavam e reclamavam sobre a injusti a mas isso n o tinha a ver com a defesa de seus direitos elas deixavam as autoridades superiores decidir quais eram os seus direitos
470285 o que elas pedem agora um mudan a no sistema e isso reflete uma mudan a generalizada de postura
470286 vi uma dist ncia gigantesca entre a hist ria oficial e a realidade como a presen a de policiais armados

470294 and were not going to leave stamkos out there by himself
470295 i dont know how to be any clearer than that we will never move this team we have amazing fans an amazing base we were 30th in the standings but 10th in attendance this is a great market a great city
470296 but were going to find some things out how we can drive some revenues and when we do that were going to be spending it on ways to win
470297 if you can make good hockey decisions its not always the team that spends the most money and thats been proven over and over again in hockey

470299 o objetivo que n s criamos ser campe o temos que pensar pela grandeza e tradi o do atl tico parece ser uma tarefa muito dif cil mas n o vejo hoje no brasil nenhuma equipe sensacional estamos apenas na 16 rodada e temos muito o que fazer trabalhar e nos ajustar dentro e fora do campo para atingir esse objetivo
470300 inicialmente vamos trabalhar com esse grupo que esta a a maioria trabalhou comigo e outros eu conhe o s com poucos eu ainda n o tive contato acho que poss vel trabalhar com esse grupo uma quest o de extrair dos atletas o m ximo isso se faz atrav s do trabalho da conversa e de um time bem montado taticamente

470336 do you really want to hurt me of course sung by boy george cough
470337 this is the end of the world this is the end of youth creativity
470338 in many ways the lifestyle promoted by hipsterdom is highly ritualized
470339 what they may or may not know is that cool hunters will also be skulking the same sites taking note of how they dress and what they consume
470340 hipsterdom is the first counterculture to be born under the advertising industrys microscope leaving it open to constant manipulation but also forcing its participants to continually shift their interests and affiliations
470341 an amalgamation of its own history the youth of the west are left with consuming cool rather that creating it the cultural zeitgeists of the past have always been sparked by furious indignation and are reactionary movements but the hipsters self involved and isolated maintenance does nothing to feed cultural evolution western civilizations well has run dry the only way to avoid hitting the colossus of societal failure that looms over the horizon is for the kids to abandon this vain existence and start over

470347 i feel like a piece of furniture because i cant do my job the way i see it
470348 the relatives of the victims cannot be happy with that because what is needed is that the killings and disappearances stop altogether
470349 the reduction in the numbers does not matter so long as we dont see our relatives given justice
470350 in some parts of the country the armed forces have followed a deliberate strategy of systematically hunting down the leaders of leftist organizations
470351 one one hand there is success in our campaign to stop the killings and disappearances since there is a drop in their rates but still we are not happy because we havent seen our loved ones and there is still no justice
470352 these decisions unfortunately disregard the actual state of human rights in the philippines today that has prompted the promulgation of the new remedy in the first place this spate of decisions will only encourage the re escalation of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances because of the continuing impunity which has unfortunately and unwittingly been judicially engendered further
470353 the perpetrators of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances will surely be emboldened to commit more of the same
470354 the rates may have decreased but because of what has been happening in the court of appeals we can be almost sure that the killings and disappearances will again escalate
470355 yes in a way it encourages more human rights violations especially extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances because it shows the impunity of the perpetrators because the court of appeals shows that the perpetrators need not answer for their crimes

470365 we have got a much better hr self service system in place now which records much more accurately than ever before the number of days lost
470366 i suspect it may well be down to stress factors as a result of massive changes within local government
470367 during the local government review last year most people thought a unitary ipswich would be created
470368 obviously that has a knock on effect on staff morale and potentially leads to increased levels of stress because of uncertainty about the future suffolk homes

470418 place in which prostitution is encouraged or allowed within this state
470419 i had no epiphany no singular revelation no moment of truth but a steady accumulation of a thousand slights a thousand indignities a thousand unremembered moments that produced in me an anger a rebelliousness a desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people there was no particular day on which i said from henceforth i will devote myself to the liberation of my people instead i simply found myself doing so and could not do otherwise

470486 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
470487 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
470488 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
470489 there is also tremendous evidence that subsequent anthrax attacks are connected to iraq

470491 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
470492 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
470493 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
470494 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab

470530 further to the announcement made on july 24th 2008 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date a further announcement will be made in due course
470531 there can be no certainty that the discussions will lead to an offer being made for british energy group
470532 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful we thought it was a good deal and we were ready to accept
470533 edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
470534 that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and the government is a minority shareholder in a publicly listed company it is a now matter for both boards to see how to proceed
470535 the level of interest in nuclear new build in the uk from edf and from other operators remains high
470536 recent developments in energy markets underline the need for new nuclear to combat high fossil fuel prices climate change and security of supply
470537 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date

470549 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
470550 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
470551 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
470552 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
470553 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
470554 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
470555 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on

470557 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
470558 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
470559 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
470560 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese

470587 we had a difficult start to this weekend but weve improved throughout the sessions and learnt a lot of things along the way
470588 i made a mistake on my fast lap in q1 and lost two and a half tenths in one corner so my q1 time did not show the true potential of our car
470589 we then had a good chance of making it into q3 but a hydraulic problem meant i couldnt go out at all in q2 which was disappointing
470590 as both are very soft on this track but the harder ones were better for me today
470591 aside from plenty of traffic i didnt really manage to find the right balance on my last set of option tyres
470592 both factors compromised my run we now need to go through the data and work out whats happening in order to get the most out of the car for tomorrow
470593 it was always going to be a tight qualifying session for us
470594 nico obviously could have delivered more but a hydraulic problem kept him in the garage for the whole of q2
470595 there was no sign of it during the last run in q1 but it became apparent when we fired up for the second session

470597 will you regret it when youre 30 if you dont go
470598 were making steps forward and i got the most out of it for sure there was nothing else left in the car
470599 weve definitely made some progress with the new developments to the car and in particular the new rear suspension is working well and this has enabled us to improve the car step by step over the weekend
470600 im happy to have qualified in p12 today after a good lap on the final run in q2 pushed me a few places up the grid
470601 im on the dirty side of the grid which is a disadvantage but i am sure we can have a good race tomorrow from here nonetheless
470602 choosing which tyre to run was a really tough decision today and it was a difficult qualifying session
470603 i felt the super soft option tyre was working slightly better with the car so i stayed with that for my final run
470604 after a good first sector i went in too quick for turn 11 and made a mistake which ruined my lap

470736 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
470737 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
470738 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
470739 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well

470761 the defiant stands taken by dimora and russo this week upon their return to work show that we should not expect them to take the path for the greater good without guidance

470821 terrorists had warned they would destroy the american economy financially and we can see their success in the high prices of oil
470822 no we cant afford to have another attack and thats why we cant vote for a democrat
470823 its more offensive that our nation is forgetting about the attacks
470824 media only mentions the devastation in iraq without really letting people know exactly whats going on
470825 reminding people that terrorists are behind a lot of destruction
470826 people are happy that we are remembering these people that died
470827 wed just feel more comfortable with a woman in that position

470839 you can a do nothing and loose 40 of your money in 2008 or b make 144 more money than the average vanguard investor
470840 how dans vanguard midas touch has made his subscribers rich
470841 advantage 144 extra profit 587 022 and just below that there is an ordering hyperlink that says
470842 members of dan wieners service are nine times richer than the average vanguard investor join dan today
470843 indexing is how can i say this nicely for suckers maybe thats a bit harsh
470844 if all but the 50 largest stocks continue to gain over the next 15 years youd continue to lose money the whole time
470845 index funds are once again this year set to dip then dive
470846 conclude that my way of investing in vanguard funds has an 87 probability to continue to outperform index funds for the foreseeable future
470847 unfortunately most vanguard investors wont have a say in the matter vanguard wont give them or you the choice they wont tell you what to do no matter how bad things get in 2008
470848 dans strategy is simple yet powerfully effective his deep knowledge of vanguard his investigative insights and his investment results prompted two duke professors to study his methods under a microscope
470849 the studys conclusion the probability that wieners growth portfolio could have outperformed by such a wide margin because of luck rather than skill is only 13
470850 deep knowledge of vanguard his investigative insights and his investment results
470851 turns out everyone except my members and me is wrong about indexing the two duke university professors i referenced earlier conclude that my way of investing in vanguard funds has an 87 probability to continue to outperform index funds for the foreseeable future
470852 this is a solicitation for the independent adviser for vanguard investors a monthly general interest newsletter which is not liable for the suitability or future investment performance of any securities or strategies discussed historical investment return examples given are hypothetical and not to be taken as representative of any individuals actual trading experience
470853 investors would be well advised to buy index funds instead of managed funds in situations where those funds closely track their index fund baskets
470854 an average out performance of 46 which was not statistically significant much of this differential was explained by the extraordinary performance of the vanguard international explorer capital opportunity and primecap funds
470855 when managed fund performance is not well explained by a tracking index fund basket investor may look toward the managed funds
470856 the managed funds on average have expense ratios that are 26 greater than their corresponding tracking index they also had turnover rates that are 33 greater than the tracking index
470857 wieners growth portfolio performed better over the 10 years ending december 2006 on both a risk adjusted and a non risk adjusted basis that his other three portfolios the odds that one of his portfolios would perform well due to luck are greater than the odds that one particular portfolio will perform well so arguably our 13 4 figure in the text overstates his portfolio picking prowess the march 2007 edition of the hulbert financial digest lists the wiener newsletter as fifth out of 24 mutual fund newsletters on the basis of total return and tenth out of 24 on the basis of risk adjusted return
470858 we find those managed funds that he weiner rates buy hold and sell have average geometric alphas presumably skill based performance differences for the four year period of 1

470878 it was difficult to choose the right tyre for the final session and i felt i could have done a slightly faster lap in q3 but i was a little cautious in turn two still weve found a great direction with the car and ive got a great opportunity to win the race tomorrow
470879 its fantastic to be starting on the front row alongside lewis i hope that starting on the dirty side of the track wont be a disadvantage and i fully expect us to look out for each other in the first corner tomorrow this result really repays the team for all of its efforts over the past few months
470880 its a shame i didnt manage to get the best out of the car in q3 mainly because of traffic especially on my second run in the first two parts of qualifying the car felt good as can be seen from my times but then i never managed to prepare the tyres in the best way
470881 clearly overtaking isnt easy but we have good pace and i will try and exploit that in fighting with the two drivers ahead of me on the grid
470882 i am really happy with the result this was certainly one of my best qualifying sessions so far this season i was not expecting to start from fourth as the car has been quite difficult to drive over the entire weekend
470883 we struggled a bit with the balance but in the end i was able to make the harder tyre compound work very well and here we are i am now looking forward to the race

470933 the sad truth is that the fcc is ill equipped to detect isps interfering with your internet connection
470934 its up to concerned internet users to investigate possible network neutrality violations and effs switzerland software is designed to help with that effort comcast isnt the first and certainly wont be the last isp to meddle surreptitiously with its subscribers internet communications for its own benefit
470935 until now there hasnt been a reliable way to tell if somebody a hacker an isp corporate firewall or the great firewall of china is modifying your internet traffic en route
470936 the few tests available have been for narrow and specific kinds of interference or have required tremendous amounts of advanced forensic labor switzerland is designed to make general purpose isp testing faster and easier
470937 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed

470962 they demanded we hand over our wallets i think they look for any excuse to hook into tourists
470963 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period
470964 i tried to run but it was very late at night and we were in a secluded part of the island with no one else around to help i was bashed so severely that my eye socket was smashed to pieces requiring major surgery when i returned to london where i am currently living

470972 im advocating a program that would see state governments accept the inevitable with ministries reduced to five and state mps serving on a part time basis
470973 there has been a devastating leaching of state government powers to the commonwealth i dont think its a good thing but sadly it is irreversible
470974 meanwhile the national government has clawed indigenous affairs off the states and territories and might as well be making all the decisions in this area
470975 and its hard to see much autonomy left in health policy for the states after the current review
470976 apart from police the one area where they are likely to continue to have real autonomy is in land use planning implementing capital city plans controlling rivers and native vegetation running most national parks making forestry decisions

470997 ik heb laatst gehoord dat er wilde honden op de universiteit zitten
470998 jij had hier gewoon vandaan moeten blijven dan was er niets gebeurd dan had ik niets om mij zorgen over te maken
470999 de universiteit is echt niet van jou alleen of zo
471000 het was op dat moment dat ik besefte dat ik maurits heverlee uit de weg zou moeten ruimen
471001 hoe kan ik me het beste van maurits heverlee ontdoen
471002 ik kan slechts zeggen dat ik van plan ben mijn plannen aangaande maurits heverlee vanavond bij voorkeur laat tot uitvoering te brengen
471003 toon ik moet je spreken kun je vanavond naar de universiteit komen
471004 die rechtswinkel heeft mijn zaak een beetje verprutst en ik krijg niet echt mijn waarborg terug en zo dus naar die huurwoning kan ik ook niet terug
471005 nee j u zat je kijkt totaal niet uit man je geeft feesten bent luidruchtig en dan die felrooie reflecterende rugzak van je die bewakers gaan je vroeg of laat vinden rotjong en dan komen ze ook achter mij aan

471007 tilburg is van bovenaf eigenlijk een heel mooie stad kijk ik kan zelfs westpoint zien

471011 ik loop grote risicos door met die cijfers te gaan liggen rommelen om over het inbreek aspect nog maar te zwijgen sorry
471012 weet je wat ook jammer zou zijn als iemand zou verklappen dat jij op de universiteit woonde of als iemand zeg maar een ingezonden brief naar de univers stuurde waarin hij jou met naam en toenaam noemde en je favoriete slaapplaatsen op een rijtje zette en wat niet al
471013 dat toch zeker niet waar wil je anders gaan wonen onder een brug hee of je kunt op de campus van de universiteit van groningen terecht heeft groningen een universiteit moet bijna wel waar moeten al die noorderlingen anders heen

471017 je ziet een groot deel van de gebouwen om ons heen de campus het bos
471018 het gaat me om het feit dat je als je dit wilt doen net zo goed nu de bewaking kunt bellen om jezelf aan te geven
471019 ze zullen het echt niet doorhebben of zo we doen alleen in n van de lokalen de lichten aan dat zie je vanaf beneden echt niet
471020 hoeveel mensen hoe ga je die lui naar boven krijgen
471021 eh met de lift er zijn er daar drie mocht je dat niet weten drie liften ik laat me insluiten schakel het alarm uit en doe dan van binnenuit voor ze open en ik heb maar een man of twintig vijfentwintig uitgenodigd
471022 een man of twintig vijfentwintig dat is voldoende om een klein afrikaans land over te nemen
471023 ja maar ik kon natuurlijk niet de ene helft van mijn mentorgroep wel uitnodigen en de andere helft niet
471024 vijfentwintig man in je mentorgroep wat studeer je in godsnaam volkenkunde

471217 what farmers are facing as a result of the green shift is a considerable increase in input costs whether its a result of fuel that farmers use or even as a result of how much their input costs may go up as a result of this carbon tax

471260 if in the attempt to carry out a conspiracy to commit one felony another felony is committed by one of the conspirators all conspirators are guilty of the felony actually committed though having no intent to commit it if the offense was committed in furtherance of the unlawful purpose and was one that should have been anticipated as a result of the carrying out of the conspiracy
471261 in the wake of all the media attention geared towards dna and mental competency issues inmates with other legitimate innocence claims are being unjustly sentenced and forgotten about people sentenced under the law of parties are among such claims
471262 we think that the timing of a new product introduction will depend upon the sales profile for the ds and believe that lower than expected ds hardware sales could trigger an earlier launch for the new device

471275 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

471280 the priest abuse and some of the other things that is not making the church a bad or a good place the way it will work is how it is handled and in those dioceses where it is being handled openly and with compassion and with care and explanation and openness i think those parishes and that church there will be very strong

471301 behold the lord comes with ten thousands of his saints 15 to execute judgment on all to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him
471302 and after that my great grandfather enoch gave me all the secrets in the book and in the parables which had been given to him and he put them together for me in the words of the book of the parables
471303 the greek word pseudepigrapha is a greek word meaning falsely superscribed or what we moderns might call writing under a pen name the classification ot pseudepigrapha is a label that scholars have given to these writings
471304 the book of enoch is a pseudepigraphical work a work that claims to be by a biblical character the book of enoch was not included in either the hebrew or most christian biblical canons but could have been considered a sacred text by the sectarians
471305 an ancient composition known from two sets of versions an ethiopic one that scholars identify as 1 enoch and a slavonic version that is identified as 2 enoch and which is also known as the book of the secrets of enoch both versions of which copied manuscripts have been found mostly in greek and latin translations are based on early sources that enlarged on the short biblical mention that enoch the seventh patriarch after adam did not die because at age 365 he walked with god taken heavenward to join the deity
471306 i enoch also known as the ethiopic apocalypse of enoch is the oldest of the three pseudepigraphal books attributed to enoch the man who apparently did not die but was taken up to heaven gen 5 24 the book was originally written in either hebrew or aramaic perhaps both but it survives in complete form only in ethiopic geez and in fragmentary form in aramaic greek 1 1 32 6 6 1 10 14 15 8 16 1 89 42 49 97 6 104 and latin 106 1 18
471307 the materials in i enoch range in date from 200 b c e to 50 c e i enoch contributes much to intertestamental views of angels heaven judgment resurrection and the messiah this book has left its stamp upon many of the nt writers especially the author of revelation
471308 prior to the eighteenth century scholars had believed the book of enoch to be irretrievably lost composed long before the birth of christ and considered to be one of the most important pieces of jewish mystical literature it was only known from fragments and from references to it in other texts james bruce changed all this by procuring several copies of the missing work during his stay in ethiopia these were the first complete editions of the book of enoch ever to be seen in europe
471309 the book of enoch remained in darkness until 1821 when the long years of dedicated work by a professor of hebrew at the university of oxford were finally rewarded with the publication of the first ever english translation of the book of enoch the reverend richard laurence archbishop of cashel had labored for many hundreds of hours over the faded manuscript in the hands of the bodleian library carefully substituting english words and expressions for the original geez while comparing the results with known extracts such as the few brief chapters preserved in greek by syncellus during the ninth century
471310 the original aramaic version was lost until the dead sea fragments were discovered
471311 the original language of most of this work was in all likelihood aramaic an early semitic language although the original version was lost in antiquity portions of a greek translation were discovered in egypt and quotations were known from the church fathers the discovery of the texts from qumran cave 4 has finally provided parts of the aramaic original humankind is called on to observe how unchanging nature follows gods will
471312 1 enoch preserved in a full 108 chapter form in ethiopic consists of five parts and one appended chapter it originated in aramaic perhaps hebrew for chaps 37 71 was translated into greek and from greek into ethiopic
471313 the aramaic book of enoch very considerably influenced the idiom of the new testament and patristic literature more so in fact than any other writing of the apocrypha and pseudepigrapha
471314 as it now stands i enoch appears to consist of the following five major divisions 1 the book of the watchers chaps 1 36 2 the book of the similitudes chaps 37 7l 3 the book of astronomical writings chaps 72 82 4 the book of dream visions chaps 83 90 and 5 the book of the epistle of enoch chaps 91 107
471315 chaps 1 36 the book of the watchers may date from the third century bce parts of its text have been identified on several copies from qumran cave 4 the earliest fragmentary manuscript 4qenocha dates according to the editor j t milk to between 200 and 150 bce all qumran copies are in the aramaic language
471316 james vanderkam divides the first part of 1 enoch into five sections 1 5 a theophany followed by an eschatological admonition 6 11 the angel story stories 12 16 enoch and the failed petition of the angels who descended 17 19 enochs first journey 20 36 enochs second journey chap 20 is a list of angels who are connected with the journeys
471317 chaps 72 82 the astronomical book like the book of watchers may date from the third century bce the oldest copy of it seems to have been made not long after 200 bce sizable portions of the text are preserved on four copies written in aramaic from qumran cave 4 the aramaic original appears to have been much different and much longer than the ethiopic text adding far more astronomical details
471318 a world view so encyclopaediac that it embraced the geography of heaven and earth astronomy meteorology medicine was no part of jewish tradition but was familiar to educated greeks but attempting to emulate and surpass greek wisdom by having an integrating divine plan for destiny elaborated through an angelic host with which enoch is in communication through his mystical travels
471319 in the seventh generation from adam enoch also prophesied these things saying behold the lord came with his holy myriads to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in such an ungodly way and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners spoke against him
471320 2 enoch or the slavonic apocalypse of enoch was written late first century c e in egypt by a jew it survives only in late old slavonic manuscripts it may have been composed originally in aramaic or hebrew later being translated into greek and later still being translated into old slavonic it is an amplification of gen 5 21 32 from enoch to the flood major theological themes include 1 god created the world out of nothing 24 2 2 seven heavens 30 2 3 and angelic hosts 3 god created the souls of men before the foundation of the earth 23 5 4 abodes of heaven and hell are already prepared for righteous and sinners and 5 ethical teachings which at times parallel those of the nt and proverbs
471321 and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him
471322 this is my son the elect one from the greek ho eklelegmenos lit
471323 to execute judgment on all to convict all who are ungodly

471357 we have all been under pressure jock hobbs and the board the administration the team the new zealand rugby public just wanted a performance and they got a performance tonight that was right out of the top drawer
471358 it will give us some foundation some confidence and a wee bit of relief from the pressure
471359 so we can build from there hopefully but the game in cape town will be massive and the game in brisbane will be massive
471360 both teams playing in those two encounters will be absolutely on the edge of the edge so its going to be pretty special
471361 im very proud of the team i though they played exceptionally well it keeps us alive in the tri nations and the bledisloe cup
471362 we dont underestimate the magnitude of that task we have two away games now but it was a fine performance and im very proud of the guys who did the job
471363 we learnt a lot from last week the players learnt a lot the coaches learnt a lot we changed the game plan around and the guys executed that exceptionally well
471364 i thought the front five had a hell of a big game
471365 they the wallabies never got any front foot ball and some of the tackles that went in forced turnovers
471366 we put the ball at the right end of the field that came about from pressure and we camped down their end of the field for periods and got the points we were after
471367 i thought they australia played bloody well last week and i thought we played pretty well this week i think the next contest is going to be massive because both teams will have equal edge
471368 i think its just edge and the tactical approach as wayne said every dog has its day and it just happened to be our day
471369 it looks like just a flash in the pan job
471370 it was loud it was so loud it really made me jump
471371 so we got up to check the power box there was no light out there it was really dark but my partner saw someone slumped against our fence and he told me to go and grab a torch and the phone to ring the police
471372 initially the man was still alive and i told my partner to give him cpr but then he saw the shotgun and the police said to stay away
471373 we didnt realise there was another person who was already dead it was so dark but then one of the police lights shone over her and we saw that there was a lady lying on the ground covered in blood

471377 by revoking my jerusalem id they have revoked all the rights i have in palestine as well as my sons
471378 there is an ongoing and widely documented policy of discrimination in planning and building land expropriation home demolition the whole issue of revoking residency
471379 we believe in a jewish majority in jerusalem as such it is the capital of the jewish nation
471380 the israelis tried to take jerusalem out of the political game by using all their power to change the situation and consolidate their rule over the city but they failed
471381 she was born there i dont see why she should change it
471382 just because we came under occupation does not mean they israelis have the right to expel people
471383 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
471384 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
471385 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
471386 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
471387 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
471388 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
471389 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
471390 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
471391 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
471392 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
471393 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
471394 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us

471399 the reality of sex differences between men and women leading to the potential for offspring is essential to the pre political foundation of marriage
471400 is precisely what advocates of same sex marriage seek to change
471401 marriage rooted in procreation and sexual differences is to be replaced by marriage for the gratification of two consenting adults
471402 same sex marriage requires a condition of soft despotism to exist
471403 state also claims for itself the ability to declare what constitutes marriage it transforms marriage from a pre political obligation into its own creation
471404 an institution that needs to be coddled its very fragility demands a culture in which it is protected
471405 once marriage becomes a statist institution for the sake of consenting adults the state will increasingly be called upon to create the social conditions to protect these unions
471406 we couldnt have done what we did had that great run without them thats for sure
471407 one of the things youve got to be able to do as a coach is handle different relationships and know how to motivate them its a really outstanding testament to emmitt
471408 i know all of us feel blessed to go in but to go in with those two young men that i had a chance to work with probably had some play in continuing my coaching career is the topping on all of it
471409 from what im understanding i think im officially the second fastest guy in the family and theres only two of us in here
471410 i felt we probably hurt art some because we played him inside and he even blocked for us in there
471411 it probably cost him some yards on average per catch
471412 you know he coached art first before he transferred over to defense and coached me now you talk about something interesting
471413 what he brought to me was an appreciation and a knowledge of what i was doing and not to begin to try and adjust that but saying youre doing it youre doing what you need to do because i know what it takes at that position
471414 the winglet consists of a body with a projected area the size of an a3 sheet of paper that houses an electric motor two wheels and internal sensors that constantly monitor the users position and make adjustments in power to ensure stability meanwhile a unique parallel link mechanism allows the rider to go forward backward and turn simply by shifting body weight making the vehicle safe and useful even in tight spaces or crowded environments
471415 he always demanded that female workers signalled to him with their eyes that they desperately wanted to be laid on the boardroom table as soon as he gave the word
471416 i didnt realise at first that he wasnt speaking metaphorically
471417 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
471418 remember the famous quote from colonel nicholson in bridge over the river kwai
471419 one day the war will be over and i hope that the people that use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built and who built it

471483 siria est madura para la paz la presencia de un viceministro sirio en la conferencia de annapolis junto a israel y arabia saud enemigo jurado de su aliado iran as lo demuestra ser a un error seguir aislando a siria un pa s que mantiene tan largas fronteras con israel turqu a l bano y jordania en un momento en que estados unidos chapotea en irak y se estanca en busca de una paz israelo palestina aceptable para las dos partes occidente debe convencerse de ello la pol tica de ostracismo acent a la dependencia de siria respecto al ir n de ahmadineyad condena al l bano a la dominaci n de hezbol e incluso a la larga a su desaparici n finalmente conduce inevitablemente a la guerra entre siria e israel
471484 esta es la ruta que recorren los muhaydines antes de ingresar de manera ilegal a irak para hacerle la guerra a los estados unidos
471485 mira ir n es el elemento m s importante de este eje del mal siria es la parte central que le permite a un estado no rabe llegar al coraz n del medio oriente hezbol recibe sus armas de ir n a trav s de siria y los guardias revolucionarios iran es est n estacionados hoy en el valle de bekaa bajo protecci n siria
471486 esta alianza no es nueva siria bajo la dinast a de assad fue el nico pa s rabe importante que apoy al ir n persa contra el irak rabe en la guerra entre irak e ir n forman un verdadero eje porque buscan el mal
471487 en m xico no todos van a entender la profundidad de lo que estoy diciendo
471488 yo creo en occidente no hay ninguna alternativa mejor no quiero ser protegido por los chinos ni controlado por los rusos ni dominado por el islam y creo que israel es parte integrante de occidente los que no piensan as o est n equivocados o son derrotistas
471489 c mo derrotar a este eje del mal ir n es demasiado grande demasiado rico en petr leo y demasiado agresivo para ser confrontado directamente los grupos terroristas por su parte son muy esquivos pero siria es diferente como es un estado tiene una direcci n la identidad y ubicaci n de su direcci n pol tica sus instalaciones militares y sus dem s recursos son bien conocidas a diferencia de ir n sin embargo no tiene ning n petr leo significativo es pobre y el r gimen es d bil despreciado no solo por su corrupci n e incompetencia sino tambi n por la estrechez de su base tnica assad y su pandilla son casi exclusivamente de la secta alawita un desprendimiento chi ta considerado her tico por muchos musulmanes y que s lo representa alrededor de 10 por ciento de la poblaci n del pa s por consiguiente siria es el objetivo es vulnerable y es el centro geogr fico del eje el punto de distribuci n de las armas y el refugio para los terroristas de la regi n si se puede echar abajo su gobierno se quiebra el eje

471492 if senator obama did not say what he said he would never get elected
471493 politicians say what they say and do what they do based on electability based on sound bites based on polls
471494 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life

471764 obviously we cannot be happy with this result especially when our main opponents have the front row to themselves
471765 our main aim this weekend was and still is to get the most out of our car tyre team package and today we failed to do that especially in the final part of qualifying now we have to try and do it in tomorrows race it will be tough because our grid positions are not the best and we are up against very strong opposition but it is not an impossible task we have strong potential which we saw today it will be a case of getting all the elements to come together as well as possible
471766 its a shame i didnt manage to get the best out of the car in q3 mainly because of traffic especially on my second run in the first two parts of qualifying the car felt good as can be seen from my times but then i never managed to prepare the tyres in the best way clearly overtaking isnt easy but we have a good pace and i will try and exploit that in fighting with the two drivers ahead of me on the grid
471767 i made a mistake on my final flying lap which cost me precious time and that followed on from not having got a great lap on my previous attempt which explains why im sixth of course i am not happy and starting from the third row my race will be an uphill struggle i will try and make the most of this situation given that the car today was not that bad we are going through a bit of a difficult time but we mustnt give up all we need to do is put together all the pieces of the jigsaw and then the results will come to us again

471831 the music was very powerful and i like the psychedelic art it was a very vibrant time and very inspiring in terms of jewelry
471832 its nice when they actually choose your piece and theyre not being told by the stylist to wear it
471833 i found it more exciting seeing ashley olsen in us weekly walking down the street or having lunch with friends wearing the piece rather than just posing in it
471834 i thought if i really want to do the most creative things that are in my mind and push my ideas forth i have to focus full time on my own jewelry

471860 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
471861 i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
471862 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
471863 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
471864 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done

471877 whether that is as a no 2 or competing for no 1 i am going to be pushing to make myself better or pushing the person who is playing to play better
471878 clubs with a good atmosphere have positive effects as they have competitive players who are pushing each other to make the team better

471967 education is an admirable thing but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught
471968 most people are other people their thoughts are someone elses opinions their lives a mimicry their passions a quotations
471969 nothing is either good or bad but thinking makes it so
471970 few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment most people are even incapable of forming such opinions
471971 no one told me the baby was white its not that i minded i was just so startled by it at first the social worker later told me she wished i could have seen the look on my face when the baby arrived
471972 she and i have been through so much that were able to have our fights and carry on
471973 really i knew she was adopted but i didnt know you fostered her
471974 no one told me the baby was white its not that i minded i was just so startled by it at first the social worker later told me she wished i could have seen the look on my face when the baby arrived
471975 flora was only a month old when i got her
471976 they said she would only be with us for a few weeks
471977 i had never fostered a white child before because she was so little and up all night for feedings my husband my oldest daughter and i took turns sleeping with her i dont think she ever slept in a crib she was always curled into the side of one of us
471978 i was working at the daycare center even back then
471979 i told ms light that i had to have a spot for the baby and she let flora in ill never forget the look of surprise on her face when she peered down at flora and saw that she was white
471980 my extended family was surprised to see us with a white child but we all fell in love with her
471981 we had a screened in porch that ran the whole length of the house
471982 back before you had to worry about crime we used to make pallets and sleep out there it was cool nice you cant do that now
471983 i remember flora sitting on the steps of that porch when the whole family got together this little white child that we all loved
471984 you know at the time it was illegal for blacks to adopt white children
471985 we were really attached to flora so we had to find her a home in the end ms light adopted flora her own firstborn was only thirteen months old but she took flora in and adopted her right around her second birthday
471986 to this day flora is part of both of our families she tells everyone that she has a black family and a white family
471987 youll want to fit in and not look suspicious when dealing with circus people

472006 dari musailamah utusan allah kepada muhammad utusan allah kesejahteraan semoga dilimpahkan atasmu aku telah bersekutu dalam urusan kenabian ini denganmu dan bagi kami separuh tanah dan bagi quraisy separuh tanah tetapi kaum quraisy adalah kaum yang melampaui batas
472007 muhammad itu sekali kali bukanlah bapak dari seorang laki laki di antara kamu tetapi dia adalah rasulullah dan penutup nabi nabi dan adalah allah maha mengetahui segala sesuatu
472008 dulu bani israil yang mengurus mereka adalah para nabi jika salah seorang nabi wafat maka nabi yang lain menggantikannya tetapi sesungguhnya tak ada nabi setelahku dan akan ada para khalifah dan jumlah mereka banyak
472009 penuhilah baiat yang pertama dan pertama dan berilah pada mereka hak mereka sesungguhnya allah akan menanyai mereka atas apa yang mereka urus
472010 wahai ali tidakkah engkau ridlo kedudukanmu di sisiku seperti harun as bagi musa as akan tetapi bahwasanya tak ada lagi nabi sepeninggalku
472011 dan siapa saja yang mencontohkan perbuatan yang buruk kemudian ia berbuat dengannya maka ia mendapat balasannya dan balasan orang yang mengikutinya tanpa mengurangi balasan mereka sedikitpun
472012 umatku rusak oleh dua golongan manusia orang alim yang keji dan orang bodoh yang suka beribadah
472013 janganlah kamu ikuti segala sesuatu yang kamu tidak punya pengetahuan tentangnya sesungguhnya pendengaran penglihatan dan hati masing masing ada pertanggungjawabannya
472014 katakanlah kepada wanita yang beriman hendaklah mereka menahan pandangannya dan memelihara kemaluannya dan janganlah mereka menampakkan pehiasaannya kecuali yang biasa nampak dari pandangan
472015 nabi saw melaknat laki laki yang mengenakan pakaian wanita dan seorang wanita yang mengenakan pakaian laki laki
472016 siapa yang meniru suatu kaum maka ia berarti dari golongan mereka
472017 kok kamu yang ribut khan emang sudah menjadi mode yang seperti ini

472026 di dalam lembaga perkawinan ananda bisa berpacaran dengan bebas dan tenang bisa saling memembelai dan mengasihi bahkan lebih jauh dari itu yang semula haram menjadi halal setelah menikah yang semula diharamkan tiba tiba menjadi hak bagi suami atau istri yang apabila ditunaikan dengan ikhlas kepada allah akan mendatangkan pahala
472027 islam mengajarkan dua hal yaitu memenuhi hak dan kewajiban secara seimbang
472028 seorang yang membina anaknya adalah lebih baik daripada ia bersedekah satu sha
472029 nah apabila ananda sudah merasa mampu memenuhi kedua hal tadi yaitu hak dan kewajiban yang seimbang maka segeralah susun sebuah rencana berpacaran yang baik di dalam sebuah lembaga perkawinan yang dicontohkan rasulullah
472030 el primer a o fue de ensayo y error nos sirvi para definir claramente qu era lo que quer amos hacer
472031 este modelo lo manejamos en renta pues nos dimos cuenta que muchas veces las oficinas quieren dar servicio a sus empleados y a sus clientes de forma gratuita
472032 nosotros podemos programarla para que cobre lo que la empresa nos diga pero casi siempre es gratuito las empresas absorben el costo porque es realmente muy barato
472033 darle un caf a un cliente o un proveedor en una m quina como la nuestra que funciona con caf de grano cuesta poco menos de un peso es algo econ mico y rico porque manejamos un caf de muy buena calidad
472034 esto nos ha permitido mantener a nuestros clientes por mucho tiempo
472035 hemos tenido que crecer a base de prestamos y de reinvertir pr cticamente todo mi socia y yo somos de la idea de que el negocio primero tiene que crecer y ya despu s nos podr dejar ganancia
472036 pues existen muchos peque os negocios que se quedan en 10 o 15 m quinas m ximo pero no pueden crecer por el tema del rea t cnica pues tener que depender del que les vendi la m quina es fatal
472037 provoc que miles de habitantes fueran afectados en sus viviendas porque las edificaron en zonas de alto riesgo
472038 el da o es m nimo hasta el momento en la zona que se verific ayer
472039 no estoy diciendo que no haya impacto ambiental pero si digo que hay que ponerla en su justa dimensi n
472040 qu vamos a reclamar si no sabemos la magnitud de los da os
472041 when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
472042 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
472043 i became extremely friendly and fond of the police officers who protected me
472044 they were extremely scrupulous and would never behave so cruelly to me get drunk on duty or do anything else he has said
472045 at the end of my nine years of protection they even held a party for me
472046 he has not checked his facts i was never locked in a cupboard nor was i suicidal none of these things happened
472047 the first i heard about the book was three weeks ago when a senior police officer called to warn me it was coming out
472048 he said the force was humiliated apologetic and embarrassed about it
472049 i am not in the business of suppressing books i just want the stuff taken out of which he knows to be untrue
472050 this is not just my reputation at stake apart from making me look bad hes made the entire police force look bad
472051 i am taking the action because i feel loyal towards those people who risked their lives for me
472052 they are being accused of all sorts of things and yet no one seems to be defending them
472053 it is not our intention to comment on ron evans recollection and interpretation of specific events we regret that he chooses to publish this book
472054 there were a number of passages within the draft which caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations
472055 we knew we wanted to come back to florida for our wedding
472056 both of our families are here and we thought it would be easier for us to come home rather than have everyone fly out to california besides this is where it all started
472057 theres a lot of stress that comes along with planning a wedding not to mention the stress of dealing with war
472058 we just decided that it would be nice to take one stressful thing off their plate
472059 of course we werent expecting this to be free we were just excited about a military discount the experience i have had with apollo has just been wonderful
472060 it really says a lot about a company that would go to that length to honor its civil servants
472061 after receiving heather and jonathans request we really felt that this would be an opportunity to make a statement
472062 with all the political nonsense that we are all being bombarded with surrounding the war in iraq heres our chance to focus on something positive that would honor the men and women who serve our country so loyally
472063 each of us knows someone who serves in the military or as firefighter police officer teacher or any of the other jobs that are so easily taken for granted
472064 the entire apollo team is excited to launch this program that gives back to the community and it is our hope that this small gesture will inspire other businesses to follow suit
472065 i really want to say a great big thank you for all the time and attention apollo has given us
472066 its more than just knowing that we wont have to worry about the details of our transportation or that it wont cost us anything for a company to be willing to do something like this for us i feel they really understand that as a marine and a marine family we do sacrifice time and liberty to do what we are called to do i dont even know these people and we feel so appreciated by them it makes me just want to do my job better if these are the people im working for
472067 on samuse on samuse mais vient un jour o la rigolade doit cesser parce quon a d couvert un sentiment plus profond et quand vient ce jour on ne peut que remercier je ne sai qui et saisir sa chance

472085 after winning here im far more optimistic now about my chances in the olympics
472086 beijing will be much more of a lottery and ill be much more of a marked man after winning here
472087 but apart from german stefan schumacher all my rivals for a medal in beijing were here today and none of them could beat me thats encouraging
472088 ive had a long season and i wasnt sure of my condition but this result confirms ive come through the tour de france well
472089 but i bounced back towards the finish i even had a go in the sprint on the final stage on the champs elysees
472090 im really just tired and my legs are tired as far as my knee and its health it feels fine
472091 i just felt it tighten up real tight on me when i felt that i just slowed down ill get treatment for a few days and ill be fine
472092 well get in there and get him looked at and well keep our fingers crossed and hopefully its nothing
472093 hell have to rest it to see where hes at right now
472094 i am not in the best shape i am not at my highest level so it will take time for me to get better
472095 since i was a young girl its been my dream to become no 1 in the world
472096 it wont be perfect this first preseason game but we have several to get up to speed
472097 the preseason games you dont put a lot of stock in
472098 we want to get the offense going and make everyone comfortable and we want to get the defense established
472099 theyre going to be thrust into a brand new situation and even the veteran players here they dont know what im going to expect on the sidelines
472100 i think its an effective tool having that ability to get the call in in real time
472101 it alleviates some of the time it takes to get a call but they do turn it off 15 seconds before the play clock expires
472102 it is an extra preseason game its probably not the first thing we would choose
472103 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
472104 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
472105 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
472106 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
472107 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
472108 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
472109 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
472110 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
472111 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
472112 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
472113 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
472114 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
472115 it wont be perfect this first preseason game but we have several to get up to speed
472116 the preseason games you dont put a lot of stock in
472117 we want to get the offense going and make everyone comfortable and we want to get the defense established
472118 theyre going to be thrust into a brand new situation and even the veteran players here they dont know what im going to expect on the sidelines
472119 i think its an effective tool having that ability to get the call in in real time
472120 it alleviates some of the time it takes to get a call but they do turn it off 15 seconds before the play clock expires
472121 it is an extra preseason game its probably not the first thing we would choose

472129 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
472130 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
472131 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
472132 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
472133 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
472134 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
472135 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
472136 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
472137 sure wall e helps us save the planet but what this movie is really about is love for eve and how he overcomes all the hurdles that take them from cute meet to joyful defeat
472138 the movie has endearing and engaging made for each other leads the highest of stakes sincerity of emotion and very visual storytelling and it successfully conveys all this without much dialogue
472139 a genre in which the development of a romance leads to comic situations
472140 a tv weatherman gets stuck living through the same february 2nd forever until
472141 until he falls for his producer and by learning what love really means finally escapes his peculiar fate
472142 thats it thats my theme irrational love defeats lifes programming
472143 thats a perfect amplification of the whole point of the movie
472144 is now slated to live happily ever after with a handsome fellow who is not black with leaks suggesting that he will be of middle eastern heritage and called naveen
472145 who knows but that on the lower frequencies i speak for you
472146 is our supposed progress on the issue of race in america perilously gender lopsided
472147 are we generally less progressed than we like to think
472148 well i thought about watching the wire but it just doesnt seem like it would resonate with my experience
472149 okay now i can show this person in a mixed race relationship without offending everyone

472348 when youve been in front and then you are behind thats not a fantastic day
472349 we definitely need to work very hard and although everybody is working day and night right now we need to push harder from now until the end of the season

472365 now there are varieties of gifts but the same spirit and there are varieties of service but the same lord and there are varieties of activities but it is the same god who empowers them all in everyone

472424 there has been a devastating leaching of state government powers to the commonwealth i dont think its a good thing but sadly it is irreversible
472425 meanwhile the national government has clawed indigenous affairs off the states and territories and might as well be making all the decisions in this area
472426 and its hard to see much autonomy left in health policy for the states after the current review
472427 apart from police the one area where they are likely to continue to have real autonomy is in land use planning implementing capital city plans controlling rivers and native vegetation running most national parks making forestry decisions
472428 with 20 years for everyone to make the transition no state leader can be accused of blocking this reform just to preserve his or her own job

472437 though each may hope to convert the other to his way of seeing science and its problems neither may hope to prove his case the competition between paradigms is not the sort of battle that can be resolved by proof

472559 according to the information received by the special rapporteur the public television network rai has been strongly politicized since its creation in 1954
472560 the special rapporteur encourages the authorities to take the necessary measures to depoliticize the media sector in particular regarding the management of the public television and the allocation of subsidies to the print media
472561 the special rapporteur strongly recommends that the issue of conflict of interest in particular concerning the president of the council of ministers be further analysed in consultation with all concerned actors in order to find a sustainable solution whereby influence by the political sector in the media would be significantly reduced
472562 italy has a special place in europe with regard to freedom of the media because in no european country does the prime minister the head of the government who is the politician that can exert the most power over the state media own most of the other broadcasting media and many of the print media
472563 it is impossible not to conclude that the media crisis in italy is profound and serious there is a deeply flawed system of management a lack of public awareness an element of political paralysis and a deep sense of professional unease within italian journalism about the future of media

472566 relazione sui rischi di violazione nellue e particolarmente in italia della libert di espressione e di informazione
472567 uno dei settori nel quale pi evidente il conflitto di interessi quello della pubblicit tanto che il gruppo mediaset nel 2001 ha ottenuto i 2 3 delle risorse pubblicitarie televisive pari ad un ammontare di 2500 milioni di euro e che le principali societ italiane hanno trasferito gran parte degli investimenti pubblicitari dalla carta stampata alle reti mediaset e dalla rai a mediaset
472568 the concentration of political commercial and media power in italy in the hands of one person prime minister silvio berlusconi is recognised as an anomaly across the political spectrum
472569 the assembly deplores the fact that several consecutive italian governments since 1994 have failed to resolve the problem of conflict of interest and that appropriate legislation has not yet been adopted by the present parliament
472570 la eccezionale concentrazione che caratterizza il settore del broadcasting italiano il pasticcio creato dalla collusione tra media e sistema politico e leccessiva attenzione del governo alla gestione del servizio pubblico non sono soltanto anomalie italiane questi problemi rappresentano una minaccia potenziale alla democrazia stessa e possono influenzare negativamente lo sviluppo delle nuove democrazie nelleuropa centrale e orientale
472571 inoltre se come spesso avvenuto berlusconi esterna con franchezza le sue opinioni sui problemi dellinformazione e non si fa scrupoli ad influenzare le sue reti emerge con chiarezza linefficacia delle norme per garantire uninformazione corretta pluralista ed equilibrata la legge gasparri che disciplina molti aspetti dellevoluzione del mercato televisivo nonch avvia una timida privatizzazione della rai non ha migliorato lo stato di cose essendo stata vista come un prodotto del conflitto di interessi che affligge da tempo il panorama politico italiano
472572 in particolare la rai legata a doppio filo al potere politico il contratto di servizio che essa sottoscrive con il governo la obbliga ad una serie di comportamenti che sulla carta dovrebbero garantire pluralismo interno e informazione equilibrata ma che nella pratica rispondono piuttosto alle logiche della lottizzazione ossia della spartizione di reti posti di comando programmisti e giornalisti secondo le logiche partitiche e in sintonia con il governo in carica
472573 it seems possible to agree with those taking the issue of pluralism and interconnection between the political and media power as serious in particular after the new legislation of 2004
472574 the imbalance between press and television that absorbs the 60 per cent of the overall mass media advertising spending the substantial monopoly of privately owned television with mediaset that continues to show a significant increase in income and revenues every year thanks to the dragging effect of the berlusconi prime minister factor
472575 at the end of 2004 all the three mediaset news are edited by journalists with similar political ideas
472576 the first two rai news seem to have assumed the role of loudspeakers for the executive the third for the opposition
472577 does not allow the removed professionals to practice their job with another broadcaster
472578 the overall performance of the present italian broadcasting system does not appear to reflect the significant check and control role that is traditionally attributed to the media in an advanced democracy and the law n

472601 leurispes al posto di fare statistiche sta veramente dando i numeri in senso lato e sembra aver assunto il ruolo di agenzia per lo sputtanamento del paese pi che di statistiche mi sembra che oggi leurispes si stia occupando della campagna elettorale di prodi arrivando persino a mentire sapendo di mentire quando attribuisce le disfunzioni della sanit allapprovazione della devolution ben sapendo che la riforma non ancora entrata in vigore e che vi entrer solo dopo la sua approvazione referendaria
472602 la riforma sulla devolution si dice dovrebbe dissolvere le problematiche conseguenze sotto il profilo della legittimit costituzionale dei princ pi oltre che della pratica applicazione del dl 56
472603 facile prevedere che una volta introdotta la devolution con il voto referendario di conferma la possibilit di definire attraverso una legge ordinaria un qualche parametro minimale di perequazione aprirebbe una dura contrapposizione tra le regioni con base imponibile superiore alla media nazionale e tutte le altre

472605 fraudsters are taking advantage of the new craze for social networking
472606 the problem is that people dont realise the significance of the kind of information they are putting out on the web and who may be accessing it
472607 similarly nearly all of us can search for a name of an old friend and find all their personal details online without them even knowing unfortunately the fact is that not everybody is searching for a friend fraudsters can use this information to steal an individuals identity and open accounts in their name
472608 we dont want to stop people using these sites but we do advise them to limit the amount of information they make available to stop people stealing their identity individuals should think twice before putting their full date of birth online announcing theyre going on holiday could leave them open to burglary similarly dont reveal the names of pets and children as theyre often used as passwords and dont make it easy for fraudsters by listing all your networking addresses in one place play it safe and use privacy filters where available
472609 the problem is that while we say that gift giving is about sentiment not about money we act as if the best expressions of sentiment came in expensive packages

472619 our vision has been to promote healthy fitter cricketers and therefore at the camp we have invited srl ranbaxy to educate our players with the anti doping guidelines as well as to conduct comprehensive tests under their strict guidelines
472620 with icls strong focus on fair play and ethics on the cricket field dope control is a major focus area and as an answer to their requirement in this regard they have sought out srl ranbaxy to bring in the discipline of dope control it has also proven its credentials in providing assistance and expertise to the indian olympic association
472621 it is of paramount importance for fitness amp conditioning to be achieved by the players through fair and ethical means we had already stated that one of the major activities at the camp would involve a detailed re briefing educating all the players on the international doping policy it is important to update our boys on the pharmaceutical products that may unwittingly expose them to banned substances

472659 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
472660 it is going to be very difficult for republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
472661 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what they are going to try to do is make you scared of me hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name he doesnt look all those other presidents on those dollar bills
472662 i think his comments were clearly the race card because of what he said
472663 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think theyre cynical
472664 i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issue
472665 i am absolutely confident that the people of union missouri or jacksonville florida or any other city or town across the country at the end of the day is going to be making their decision based on what they think is going to be best for their lives and their childrens lives

472670 we have no plans to sell our stake in formula one
472671 we see our investment as long term and we are pleased with its performance to date
472672 the formula one group continues to be led by bernie ecclestone there are no plans to replace him and we are delighted with the results of the business under his management
472673 the formula one group has an agreement in place for 2008 2012 which governs the division of income generated by the sport by way of a prize fund
472674 if a sovereign wealth fund came along with a huge amount of money then cvc would be tempted but i suspect it would be getting to the stage where bernie is replaced if someone wanted to buy it the whole business depends on a man who is 78 years old
472675 because you might find someone who was a complete disaster coming in but we could soften it if the company has less say over what happens at a grand prix
472676 on my last lap in q1 i had four cars in my way
472677 most of them at least tried to give me room but it still cost me time
472678 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

472680 i was just real frightened that he was going to run me over for a second time that definitely went through my head and that i was going to end up permanently in a wheelchair all i could think of was my kids
472681 ive been asked so many times the same question by people which is would i leave my job because of this the answer is absolutely hell no
472682 i would do this again tomorrow if it meant i prevented a drunk driver from driving and killing an innocent person child or family
472683 im so thankful no one got hurt out of this it was just me so this is a great result fantastic
472684 they can do a bit of liposuction while theyre there
472685 i want to reassure people that national will not worsen the situation
472686 its clear we dont have a debt problem ratings agencies and market commentators say the same despite the current downturn we want to continue to lay the foundations for the next round of economic growth
472687 prudent debt financing is one tool we can use to get on with the job now to build infrastructure that will endure for decades
472688 national has confirmed they would borrow to cover the massive hole they will create in the public accounts if elected unless they are prepared to slash public services once again
472689 the national partys proposed economic programme for new zealand can be summed up in four words more borrowing from foreigners
472690 bill englishs attempt to justify his borrow and hope fiscal management by promising to borrow only for infrastructure is an insult to the intelligence of new zealanders
472691 another example of the bungling thats occurred in the department under labour
472692 a real down to earth guy thats had alot of problems in my life since birth
472693 dat was a lonng time ago i have changed i just want a good life from now on and another chance
472694 the department takes the use of cellphones in prison very seriously to stop cellphone use within prison the department is currently rolling out cellphone blocking technology across the country
472695 last year was amazing it has created lot of extra interest our tickets are selling our sponsors are happy and were confident about our future
472696 but nothing has been decided theres a process to go through all we can do is continue to put our best foot forward until a decision is made
472697 were looking to save money on things like where the boys stay while on the road
472698 last year it would have been four star hotels this year were looking for three star accommodation its having an impact on things like the players kit theyve been given two pairs of training shorts and one training jersey thats it the situation is pretty dire but were hoping it will actually galvanise the boys bring them together at least they still have a job which is more than some at the union can say
472699 if otago and counties finish last in this years competition theyre both strategically important to new zealand rugby
472700 all our necks are on the line and i must admit even though the process seems transparent enough and we measure up well in terms of the all criteria im extremely wary of this process
472701 there are some tough decisions to be made with no logical or obvious answers and human nature being what it is anything could happen the rugby union will be looking at our performances on and off the field over the past two years but we know how important it is for our team to put its best foot forward during this decision making process as it could be decisive
472702 all we ask now is for the goal posts not to be shifted
472703 if it does well be extremely unhappy were already finding it hard to recruit players because of all the uncertainty the perception is our head is on the chopping block so they dont want to come
472704 and thats a good thing for rugby were also noticing a resurgence in club rugby
472705 people are returning to the grassroots because they were a little turned off by what happened at the top last year so theres an appetite for the hawkes bay versus waikato type fixture
472706 it shouldnt be something left in the hands of the younger less experienced and more vulnerable players of course theyll feel under pressure to take the chance its totally irresponsible to put them in that position
472707 weve given the green light to previous tours to pakistan and sri lanka but this set of circumstances is beyond the pale
472708 in the end its ultimately a decision for nzc but equally its our job to ensure that the players are acutely aware of the risks involved i understand there could be financial and commercial ramifications but that cant be allowed to compromise the safety of the players
472709 the price of gas is not the problem it just went up to fast
472710 i refuse to settle for anything less than all the rights which are due me under the constitution

472714 congressman pete sessions has been and continues to be a good friend to poker players who want the freedom to play americas greatest card game
472715 previous federal case law re mastercard 2002 made it clear that existing federal criminal law wire act of 1961 applies only to internet sports wagering and not to internet poker
472716 american poker players and american financial institutions were not well served by the ambiguity and unclear nature of the uigea passed two years ago and h r 6663 does nothing to clarify the uigea at this critical time for one of americas great pastimes it is unfortunate that h r 6663 in its current form only adds to the existing confusion and contradicts its own rule of construction by implying in its findings that the sites on which millions of americans currently play are offering poker services in defiance of federal law the ppa cannot support this bill in its current form we will however continue to advance other legislative priorities that rep sessions supports such as h r 2610 which recognizes poker as a game of skill and preserves the right of adults to enjoy poker on the internet

472775 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
472776 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done

472789 expressing the sense of the house of representatives that the united states should lead a high level diplomatic effort to ensure that the durban review conference serves as a forum to review commitments to combat all forms of racism
472790 you do not combat racism by conferences that produce declarations containing hateful language some of which is a throwback to the days of

472985 la mara a de normativas y regulaciones que se implementan arbitrariamente y a diario desde comercio la aduana y la oncca
472986 las facultades que el gobierno le ha otorgado al presidente de la oncca son excesivas y se est n utilizando en forma abusiva y discrecional
472987 adem s de las retenciones que contin an siendo confiscatorias las restricciones tales como los registros de exportaci n los plazos de embarques los precios ndices entre otros impiden el normal desenvolvimiento del sector de comercio exterior
472988 el campo contribuy en los ltimos meses a devolverle el protagonismo a las instituciones fundamentales de la rep blica

472990 mucho se ha dicho sobre las diferencias entre las cuatro entidades
472991 hemos superado con la unidad a quienes buscaban nuestra divisi n
472992 cuando se ofende al campo se ofende al pueblo y cuando se ataca al campo se ataca a la argentina
472993 queremos que los gobernantes sepan que el campo forma parte del pa s y nunca m s ser furg n de cola en las decisiones que comprometan su integridad y su destino

472995 en la comisi n de enlace estamos abiertos al di logo franco y profundo
472996 un buen primer paso ser a promover la eliminaci n de las retenciones a todos los productos de las econom as regionales
472997 los peque os productores y especialmente los que est n alejados de los grandes centros de consumo no resisten los derechos de exportaci n ni los altos costos del transporte
472998 contamos para ello con el apoyo con un organismo de primer nivel como el inta para este proyecto que hoy inexplicablemente no nos ha acompa ado
472999 sab amos que no iba a ser f cil que cristiano llegase al madrid
473000 no soy yo quien tiene que valorar c mo est n las negociaciones lo nico que puedo decir es que como futbolista no tenemos ninguna duda el resto son detalles del club que est trabajando y hay que ver c mo termina esto y hasta d nde llega
473001 sab amos desde el principio que iba a ser un tema complicado que no iba a ser f cil que un jugador como cristiano llegase al real madrid
473002 si le preguntas a todos los entrenadores todos te dir n que lo quieren es un jugador que todo t cnico quiere tener en su equipo un gran jugador con la exigencia del real madrid de ganar todo cada a o necesita a los mejores
473003 hay un inter s por este jugador pero no s si est firmado no tengo esa informaci n todav a
473004 he hablado con l y sabe perfectamente que es una parte importante de nuestro proyecto es un jugador fundamental no estamos pensando en ning n momento que se puede ir est trabajando hoy ha jugado sus primeros minutos en los que se ha visto lo que es robinho me parece perfecto que muchos est n interesados
473005 personalmente me habr a gustado que jugase en un primera en espa a hab a posibilidades pero hay que aceptar la decisi n del jugador sin duda el f tbol ingl s es tambi n una escuela importante para los j venes espero que avance y mejore en muchas cosas
473006 todav a nos cuesta coger un ritmo bueno durante muchos minutos del partido pero tenemos calidad para decidir hay que sufrir ante equipos m s rodados como el hamburgo que en dos semanas empieza su liga y se nota
473007 en mi poca de jugador particip en muchos torneos jugando d as seguidos es t pico de pretemporada sufrir con partidos seguidos y lo que no quiero es arriesgar en un torneo con jugadores que han llegado de la eurocopa y s lo han entrenado una semana

473014 the world glacier monitoring service in zurich switzerland in a paper published in science in 1989 noted that between 1926 and 1960 more than 70 percent of 625 mountain glaciers in the mid latitude united states soviet union iceland switzerland austria and italy were retreating after 1980 however 55 percent of these same glaciers were advancing
473015 they were then reproduced by the appropriately named junkscience com by the cooler heads coalition the us national centre for public policy research and countless others they have even found their way into the washington post
473016 between 1960 and 1980 on the basis of data for about 400 to 450 glaciers observed each year advancing glaciers are shown to have increased from about 6 of observed glaciers to 55 during the 1960 to 1980 period on the basis of data for about 50 glaciers observed each year annual mass balance is shown to be on the average positive for about 57 of observed glaciers in the european alps and for 40 of observed glaciers in the other monitored areas of the world

473019 this is probably one of the worst movies ive seen last year
473020 fortunately my boyfriend and i were the only people in the theaters which allowed us to yell at the screen freely
473021 90 minutes of your life you will never get back
473022 it merely exposes intelligent design advocates as the fundamentalist nutcases that they really are
473023 i am offended as a biologist a christian and a human
473024 i sat for an interminable period of time in stunned silence
473025 i gave it one star because the dvd might serve as a pretty good coaster
473026 i should have known better when the expelled theater consisted only of me my girlfriend and my friend on a busy saturday night well in all fairness there was another couple who walked out in the first 20 minutes no doubt to get their money back and salvage the rest of their evening

473029 one third of british muslim students say its acceptable to kill for islam
473030 the findings were described by researchers at the centre for social cohesion think tank which commissioned the poll as deeply alarming
473031 let me finish by briefly furnishing you with my own research on csc they have a neocon agenda and their director douglas murray indeed wrote a book entitled pim fortuyn memorial conference in 2006 conditions for muslims in europe must be made harder across the board fortuyn was famous for saying islam was and that he was in favour of a cold war with islam social cohesion indeed the csc shares a building with policy exchange another rightwing stinktank last year pe were subject of a newsnight investigation which claimed to have uncovered damning evidence that they had forged receipts of extremist literature they said they purchased from britains mosques its head said he would sue the bbc we are all still waiting the dodgy reports author
473032 one third of british muslim students say its acceptable to kill for islam
473033 40 per cent want to see the introduction of islamic sharia law in britain
473034 how supportive if at all would you be of the official introduction of shariah law into british law for muslims in britain
473035 if officials wanted to introduce some or all aspects of shariah law into the uk for muslims only would you support their move
473036 do you think shariah law should be introduced into the uk it may seem like wordplay but wordplay is critically important in understanding results from polls like this and how they can be misinterpreted
473037 do not think men and women are equal in the eyes of allah
473038 an article the other day saying we should be kinder to muslims and this is what they want to do to us
473039 yet its only us who can be acused of being racist our country is going to erupt one of these days
473040 im sure 100 of britons if you asked them would prefer these people to be deported
473041 such students when firmly identified must be immediately expelled and sent back to their home countries
473042 this tells us what we already know islam is not compatible with democracy yet the government allows this hate to be spread there should be no muslim unions at university or any other institution
473043 the evidence is all around us that islam is in conflict with everything that can regarded as civilised

473051 and with good reason they are dangerous and serve to draw people away from him furthermore the power behind spells and divination is demonic
473052 our only animosity toward christianity or toward any other religion is that these institutions have claimed to be the one true right and only way witches are sick and tired of people in other religions passing judgment and spreading lies about our belief system just because they are either insecure in their own faith or dont realize that many paths to god exist in our universe
473053 if your teen isnt an activist or practitioner in middle school or high school college is a fertile field for the growth of witch sympathies

473299 puppy linux 4 0 on a dell inspiron 1150 review
473300 i just love staring at some guys back the entire show
473301 as in the first century we can expect the holy spirit to press us to listen to each other to state new insights frankly and to accept implications of the gospel new to us whether painful or exhilarating
473302 whether the bible transforms the culture or the culture is allowed to transform the bible
473303 are we being a little quick in trying to heal ourselves
473304 which god do you have to thank for your safety
473305 i did not have an overnight epiphany like so many people do
473306 given my background and personality that was an important part of the process
473307 i dont think you can read yourself into faith i had gotten to the point where i knew what history had to say about this person named jesus and what he had done on earth i think at some point you have to take a leap of faith
473308 i dont know why i was struck so hard at that moment
473309 there was nothing fascinating about this particular video but watching this depiction of an actor playing jesus on the cross it just hit me harder than id ever been hit before
473310 if that was really the son of god and he really died for me then i felt compelled to get on my knees and worship him
473311 up until that point my prayer life was like a child talking to santa claus making deals with god saying ill be good but this is what i want in return
473312 it was like the words were jumping out of the page it was literally as if it had been written just for me
473313 we have got to move away from these beautifully choreographed speeches which appeal to groups of voters who are unassailably in the obama camp already
473314 what plays well with the educated liberal voter sometimes grates with the blue collar folk whom we need on our side if we are going to win
473315 in a videogame youre writing many stories within the story
473316 its a totally different structure and a totally different philosophy of writing and i think a much much more difficult one i get the feeling more work goes into these video games than even goes into the movies
473317 this is the first game of its type and i dont think that games on console will be made the same after endwar its kind of boastful but i really do think that this is a watershed type of game
473318 antes se sab a de la existencia de las luces durante un terremoto pero se desconoc a qu las originaba ahora con esta relaci n matem tica hay prueba evidente de una relaci n directa entre las ondas s smicas con las luces del terremoto lo que confirma que los destellos son provocados por el movimiento s smico
473319 esa filmaci n explic permiti contar por primera vez en el mundo con un registro de video hay informes que se alan que hace 2 000 a os en grecia se apreciaron las primeras luces pero s lo exist an como prueba unos dibujos ya en 1960 en jap n se apreciaron las primeras fotograf as
473320 recuerdo que antes la gente dudaba pero ya est confirmado que existen
473321 relaci n diferencial temporal entre las ondas s smicas y las luces del terremoto del 2007
473322 te pedimos santo dominguito que ayudes a calmar el fuego

473329 after browsing myfolia com you could be tossing out your paper based gardening journal myfolia com is the facebook for gardeners
473330 i can confirm that usain will run both the 100m 200m in beijing
473331 its not really clear exactly what its based on if i was presumptuous or taking this for granted i wouldnt be working this hard this week im beat
473332 well weve worked wonderfully together on a number of issues campaign finance reform and some other issues hopefully hes still with the program on global warming and the rest
473333 and i look forward to continue working with him as he serves in the united states senate
473334 the rosary is the most powerful weapon to touch the heart of jesus our redeemer who so loves his mother
473335 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
473336 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
473337 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
473338 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
473339 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
473340 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
473341 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
473342 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
473343 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
473344 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or long term relief
473345 it wont drop prices in this administration or the next administration or the administration after that
473346 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
473347 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
473348 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
473349 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
473350 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good here
473351 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence thats something i am open to
473352 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
473353 if we have a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that you know i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
473354 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing and what that means is is that were going to have to try to get things done
473355 at some point people are going to have to make decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get things done
473356 the plant gets a pollinator but its unclear what rewards the treeshrews reap from the alliance
473357 im not saying i dont like the listening process but we need something concrete some action to be taken
473358 we have been beating about the bush talking about issues for a long time
473359 we want to see that all parties have a chance to sit down and work out something concrete from where we are to resolve the issues
473360 every party has the right to do what they feel right in their context were not talking about asking for sacrifice
473361 we are asking all these people to stop defending what they do as right stop accusing the other parties that what they do is wrong instead we come together and say what sacrifice what concessions will you make for the sake of the integrity of the communion for the sake of the church
473362 to go around and visit and talk face to face with all parties concerned and find out to what extent they are willing to sacrifice before we try to find a solution
473363 the little we has to make sacrifice for the big we
473364 i would like to see us taking a lead in our churches and being very serious about auditing our carbon emissions
473365 certainly such public displays as floodlit churches are the worst possible witness we could make to a world using too much energy
473366 we were at point where it seemed the government had finally got the message and was implementing policies to reduce emissions and suddenly oil prices shot up and suddenly the government caved in over taxes on petrol
473367 in my life time weve gone from a view of the world as an almost infinite resource a dustbin with infinite capacity for our waste and infinite capacity for supplying what we want oil and coal its a sobering thought that the atmosphere this thin skin of air and water which relative to the size of the earth is similar to thickness of the skin of an apple contains everything we have and everything we know thats where all human civilisation has been all art all science all living things all religion we see now it is far from being an infinite dust bin it is an infinitely precious and infinitely vulnerable speck in the vastness of the universe we have to treasure it and nurture it
473368 case of looking for your car keys where the street lamps are
473369 cultural transmission can lead to the appearance of design without a designer
473370 of the many strategies used by local parasites this was the most successful so much so that the combined weight of castrated bivalves snails shrimps and crabs was almost the equal of their fertile peers remember that these were the most common animal groups around and take a second to reflect on that sobering statistic it means that a massive proportion of the flesh in the estuaries is under parasite control ex snails take the california horn snail cerithidea californica its the most abundant single species in area that kuris and hechinger studied and its infected by 18 species of trematode almost all of the largest snails were castrated and on average 22 of an infected snails body was made up of parasites the snails had been converted into trematode factories in the pictures above you can see that the snails orange testes left have become corrupted by trematodes right every day the infected snails released a swarm of cercariae a part of the trematodes life cycle that swims with a tadpole like tail each of these lives for just a day but the snails discharge so many into the water that the combined weight of the cercariae alone also dwarfs the mass of local birds by three to ten times the snails tale illustrates that parasites have influence far beyond their already considerable weight they may have the substantial combined mass of larger animals but because they dont need to move or forage they also enjoy the high productivity typically enjoyed by microscopic organisms kuris and hechinger admit that they only looked at one specific ecosystem but they believe that their estimates will apply elsewhere and that they are if anything too conservative if they are right no consideration of food webs or ecology would be complete without taking the power of the local parasites into account kuris a m hechinger r f shaw j c whitney k l aguirre macedo l boch c a dobson a p dunham e j fredensborg b l huspeni t c lorda j mababa l mancini f t mora a b pickering m talhouk n l torchin m e lafferty k d 2008 ecosystem energetic implications of parasite and free living biomass in three estuaries can you clarify regarding the advantage to the parasite of neutering the host in the short term the advantage is apparent however if the host cannot reproduce it would seem that the long term survival strategy of the castrators must be compromised as well or am i missing something these parasites arent passed down from parent to offspring they move from snails to fish and birds where they lay eggs that can infect more snails so theres no long term benefit to sparing your hosts sex life its a parasites world and were just living in it funny i thought we humans were the biggest ones of all this post had great timing i just finished reading carl zimmers parasite rex about 2 weeks ago thoroughly enjoyed it by the way it was deeply disturbing to learn how extensively parasites influence nature now that influence is looking even greater theres just no escaping them indeed when they form such a large chunk of the animal and plant kingdoms in numbers and now in weight you have to start thinking that without them and the strategies and mechanisms plants and animals have had to evolve to combat them we possibly wouldnt have such wonderful diversity the 1st photograph is so beautiful it gives me a fresh appreciation for dale chihulys ocean forms parasites are horribly fascinating and zimmers book is excellent im interested by the way in which expts with hookworms and whippleworms keep popping up as a way to investigate damping the more severe forms of asthma or crohns disease it is sad thing truth to accept but parasites really rule the world i have ordered a copy of parasite rex curious afraid also to know more about them if parasites not only occupy their hosts but also to a certain extent actually control them i think its worth proposing a question do we know of any parasites that themselves are subject to other parasites that in turn control them also and so on ooh good question ian and the answer is yes a very large number of wasps lay their eggs in the bodies of other animals which are then eaten alive by the grubs these species are called parasitoids but a subgroup of them are hyperparasitoids they lay their eggs on the eggs larvae of other parasitoids as far as im aware this can extend to three layers wasps parasitising parasites which parastise other parasites which parasitise a poor hapless host one thing that has bothered me all day about this we as humans in civilised 2008 tend to think of this in a fairly polarised manner along the lines of those parasitic bastards are evil why dont they leave the poor hosts alone i wouldnt like to be controlled by wasp larvae or fungi so im sure those poor buggers dont either
473371 none of our high speed video systems were fast enough to capture the movement accurately
473372 luckily a bbc crew offered to rent us a super high speed camera as part of their series animal camera
473373 the strike is one of the fastest limb movements in the animal kingdom
473374 its especially impressive considering the substantial drag imposed by water
473375 saddle shaped springs are well known to engineers and architects
473376 but is unusual in biological systems interestingly a recent paper showed that a similarly shaped spring closes the venuss fly trap
473377 when the primeval members of this class the vertebrates were strongly excited and their muscles violently contracted purposeless sounds would almost certainly have been produced and these if they proved in any way serviceable might readily have been modified or intensified by the preservation of properly adapted variations

473382 im all right now but well find out tomorrow morning
473383 i hit it ok but you never know until you dont see it anymore
473384 hes a good hitter hes been in the game for a long time
473385 with a transaction that happens that quick i was able to see very limited film on him but i watched him growing up my whole life
473386 it was great for him to get that win and great mentally for his next start
473387 its great for us too to give him the ball with confidence
473388 im still disappointed with the two out runs especially with the three spot in the sixth hes got to do a better job of controlling the damage those crooked numbers hurt you and they hurt us tonight
473389 i dont want to be a disruption to the team and ive heard nick is a little out there so im going to stick with 17 and be happy with it
473390 and for him to score the winning run its great stuff
473391 im lucky it stayed in the park because it was a bad pitch
473392 i tried to throw the breaking ball down and it stayed up
473393 maybe thats a typical finish for such a well pitched game
473394 having met these guys eight hours ago everybodys been extremely positive
473395 you jump around with those guys i felt like id been here all year we were like little kids
473396 it was all new to me it was very flattering
473397 it sounds like it was time for a change of scenery for both sides
473398 i think mitt romney would serve the mccain campaign very well
473399 we saw lots of what looked like clams it was maine this would be a possibility
473400 we boiled up water in a very large pot and threw our clams in who knew they would turn out to be squished balls of horse manure covered with sand imagine the stench i think that island remains uninhabited to this day
473401 it was the camp policy to have canteen every afternoon where each camper got to choose a candy bar that day as every day i chose my favorite the incomparable oh henry a delicious combination of peanuts caramel and nougat coated in chocolate
473402 running back to my locker after the swim i grabbed the bar and took a big bite you might be able to guess the rest it was entirely covered with ants i cried and cried thinking that these ants were crawling around in my stomach which they were i ran to my brother crying and he told me not to be such a baby it took many years for me to eat an oh henry again
473403 i knew that this was something that i had to tell my mom but my only communication with my parents was through letters i was embarrassed by the whole thing and did not want my dad to know so when i composed the letter i wrote on the envelope do not let dad read this i wrote the letter fast not caring about spelling and i happened to spell cramps as craps something to this day that i have not lived down
473404 our then 11 year old dubbed the foul tasting water at camp egg water and begged us to send water
473405 this was before bottled water was widely popular and we didnt see how we could send water in an envelope
473406 we were each handed a small styrofoam boat with a candle on it we walked down to the shore line and let the candle boat float out onto the lake the twinkling lights of the flames on the dark water was an awesome sight as though a thousand fireflies glittered in the dark night and my summer started to fade away as the boat floated farther and farther away
473407 just like that like in an old time movie everything was in slow motion my wallet falling out of my pocket slowly falling and falling till it hits the bottom of the latrine
473408 what a dilemma what was i to do all was not lost because the adult leaders were sympathetic to my crying plight so along with their assistance i was able to retrieve the gross smelly wallet it was all i could to do to gingerly open it and retrieve the stuff inside
473409 turns out they were just using large words that were unfamiliar to the camp leaders like coagulate
473410 watching the boys so engrossed by amorous farm animals that they whipped out their cameras and took pictures did i mention that the farm animals seemed to enjoy breeds other than their own i am scarred for life but at least i didnt take pictures

473414 historically a lot of programs that aim to help these students are looking at whats wrong with them they are poor kids they are at risk kids they are kids from urban high schools we take a different approach were looking at whats right with them we are a strength based program
473415 in the first round of the selection process we dont even look at grades or transcripts
473416 we put them into dynamic settings large groups small groups and observe them as they interact with their peers we are looking for noncognitive traits that we think can predict success leadership skills the ability to resolve conflict its the same thing you would be looking for if you were hiring someone in the corporate world
473417 it affords us the opportunity to recruit from areas we would not normally recruit from and to see students we would not normally see

473438 t he act of making copyrighted sound recordings available for electronic distribution on a peer to peer network without licensefrom the copyright owners violates the copyright owners exclusive right of distribution regardless of whether actual distribution has been shown

473451 i think it is absolutely vital that we be at the cutting edge particularly third level education we are not there we are far from it
473452 you are either going to have to do it through taxation or through fees but it is a political taboo subject because it means you are attacking the very issue of free third level education across the board

473488 and as to oreilly as his lying about murtha suggests there has been the usual baying at the moon the facts that prove far more difficult for him to understand than the fables and the suggestion we should use saddam husseins tactics to pacify post saddam iraq but otherwise its been very quiet over in that other plane of non existence known as oreilly land that has now changed and you know what that means hey kids what time is it
473489 yes bill o came off the tracks again tuesday night in a rant split evenly between the two avenging angels who haunt his dreams air america radio and msnbc et coute et trede ouizet as they said in french class if youve read any of my books which one the soft core porn novel that was reviewed on amazon as a real load in the pants or the advice book for kids that came out just as the andrea mackris scandal broke if youve read any of my books you know i believe in karma do bad things youll get yours eventually now you know why im here bill youve done bad things do good things youll be rewarded recently two bad guys got theirs here bill went off into some story about management changes at air america a radio network he called d sastrous which i hear was the birth name of d snider from twisted sister he eventually meandered towards the point we believe there is major chaos at that far left concern as an aside bill whos this we you always talk about you and ann coulter you and your multiple personalities you and your loofah
473490 also some major chaos at msnbc where rick kaplan has left
473491 bill boy bill o hey over here back in reality based reality the latest ratings have come out from a year ago to right now msnbcs ratings are up 12 percent overall 13 percent among viewers 25 to 54 and at the hour you and i are on head to head were up 37 percent and youre down 20 percent and i know i m sorry too many numbers in there you were assured there would be no math closing in on its 10th anniversary msnbcs ratings are lower than they were six years ago which might be ridiculous you just sort of got lost in that last sentence huh bill listen slappy foxs ratings are lower than they were five years ago bill o 267 000 of your nightly viewers have vanished since last june call fox security theyre missing all 11 of foxs regular shows ratings are down four of them are down by 15 percent or more if john gibson loses any more audience he wont even need a microphone and your boss jabba the hut hes taking out ads threatening to fire his own employees your ratings whoopin stick is now smaller than your falafel

473493 youre hitting 228 i didnt like it i never hit there before but what are you going to do you just have to play better i realized that i didnt throw a tantrum if im swinging the bat good im hitting 300 and all of a sudden you put me seventh i might take it personally
473494 i am very surprised that he has remained in this streak for this length of time considering what he went through last year
473495 at the same time i know too that there is a mental toughness there
473496 i cant imagine why im so hungry all the time all of a sudden

473500 o figurino um grande aliado dos meus personagens antes de qualquer composi o vou conversar com a figurinista
473501 vi que o bicho ia pegar naquele momento tive de emagrecer para compor uma daquelas magricelas que vivem na noite a roupa foi crucial para a alicia surgir
473502 ela adora colaborar mas propus um concurso para regina ela levava o que queria vestir e eu apresentava o figurino da helena quase sempre ela usava o que a gente propunha
473503 aquele visual renovou a tv quebrou barreiras mostrou a import ncia do figurino num personagem
473504 em essas mulheres me inspirei nas roupas de pinturas do s culo xix como bar aux folies berg re de edouard manet mas casos assim s o especiais
473505 eu a decifrei quando vi que ela vestia roupas t o justas que pareciam embaladas a v cuo pensei se ela anda t o apertadinha deve se ro ar o tempo todo por isso tem tanto fogo
473506 quando ela coloca os saltos da maysa a cinturinha no lugar e as p rolas um susto mas vou ser fiel s roupas at a p gina 5 o bom criar no estilo dela
473507 a pessoa me disse que juscelino jamais usaria o n que eu tinha dado na gravata do figurino que aquilo era um absurdo
473508 as cores das roupas traziam a alegria dela todo o universo interno
473509 das team hat fantastisch gearbeitet und unser auto w hrend der letzten wochen st ndig verbessert toll dass heikki neben mir in der ersten reihe steht es sah schon ein paar mal danach aus und es ist sch n dass wir es gerade hier geschafft haben wo berholen ziemlich schwierig ist
473510 eine bessere ausgangslage f r das rennen gibt es nicht wir haben beide viel versprechende strategien und wollen morgen um den sieg k mpfen
473511 die reifenwahl f r den letzten teil des qualifyings war nicht einfach ich h tte zum schluss vielleicht etwas schneller fahren k nnen doch in kurve zwei war ich etwas vorsichtig wir fanden eine gute abstimmung und ich habe eine tolle chance morgen um den sieg zu k mpfen
473512 ich hoffe es ist kein gro er nachteil von der schmutzigen seite der strecke zu starten in der ersten kurve werden wir darauf achten uns nicht ins gehege zu kommen
473513 es muss etwas ge ndert werden weil es l uft nicht
473514 wir haben ein sehr kompetentes team alles was man braucht
473515 das war sehr kurzfristig und nur um zu sehen ob es die richtige richtung ist
473516 wir lernen immer mehr auch dar ber wo wir seit jahresbeginn falsch gegangen sind
473517 das ist der wahnsinn die waren 1 5 sekunden schneller wo gibts denn so was
473518 man l sst die piloten bis zur letzten minute warten bevor man sie raus l sst dann hast du keine chance mehr zu reagieren kannst nicht noch einmal raus fahren
473519 aber wenn man sicherheitshalber schon mal fr her eine runde f hrt hat man wenigstens eine zeit stehen
473520 wir konnten reagieren wenn etwas schief geht und das haben wir auch
473521 denn ich bin vorher schon einmal gefahren und habe keine richtige runde hinbekommen
473522 wir waren sogar eher zu fr h als zu sp t dran f r das zweite outing
473523 auf meiner fliegenden runde waren fast alle anderen fahrer auf ihrer outlap ich musste drei autos berholen und war komplett aus dem normalen timing raus das hat es versaut
473524 man h tte mich ein bisschen sp ter rauslassen sollen
473525 einerseits waren bourdais und fisichella vor mir und ich h tte keine freie strecke gehabt andererseits waren die reifen nicht mehr gut genug
473526 du planst nicht dass du dreimal raus musst das ist nicht normal
473527 du kannst nicht davon ausgehen dass du zehn fehler machst kannst nicht ganz am anfang rausgehen wenn die strecke noch viel langsamer ist
473528 das ist gar kein problem trotzdem ist die wahrscheinlichkeit sehr gering
473529 fichar a van der vaart depende de ellos si el real madrid ofreciera 16 millones por cristiano ronaldo la gente se reir a lo mismo ocurre con lo que ofrecen por rafael es como una broma
473530 en los ltimos d as han habido muchos rumores y problemas por eso ha sido mejor no alinear al jugador en estos momentos

473538 global warming increases the probabilities of floods and strong hurricanes and that is all that you can say
473539 the intensity has not really been excessive on a short term scale
473540 climate shift to unprecedentedly dry weather along with diversion of water for irrigation has converted this former reservoir in chinas minqin county into desert
473541 your problem is not global warming your problem is that youre nuts
473542 our 13 best players are a threat to any team but last year and this year weve struggled to get that 13 on the paddock
473543 youve really got to bring on your whole squad and thats the difficulty weve had here
473544 its been a bit of a shame because when weve had our best team out weve beaten the likes of leeds and st helens
473545 its just the consistency we havent had because weve never had a consistent team

473547 i cant help but believe that thousands of faithful pastors of small struggling church reading this article have just dropped into depression or into feelings of failure i know many churches with evangelistic pastors and yet the churches continue to remain small and the reverse is also true church growth in spite of the pastors efforts it appears this article suggest the lack of church growth is the pastors fault and the converse would also be true if the church grows it is due to the pastors effort which is something great to talk about a pastors conferences i believe direct evangelism grows churches but to make it all about the pastors evangelistic activity seems short sighted i believe that church growth is more than adding numbers to the roll or notches on a belt it is about the people of god on mission with god making disciple for god in order to make a difference in the life of the world and the kingdom
473548 after winning here im far more optimistic now about my chances in the olympics
473549 beijing will be much more of a lottery and ill be much more of a marked man after winning here
473550 but apart from german stefan schumacher all my rivals for a medal in beijing were here today and none of them could beat me thats encouraging
473551 ive had a long season and i wasnt sure of my condition but this result confirms ive come through the tour de france well
473552 but i bounced back towards the finish i even had a go in the sprint on the final stage on the champs elysees
473553 i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
473554 in the criminal justice system the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups the police who investigate crime and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders these are their stories
473555 the parties agreed four years ago to stop spending taxpayer money on housing youth in hurtful illegal conditions
473556 very very serious problems continue to exist at the states juvenile detention facilities
473557 a receiver could cut through the red tape and get things done
473558 we believe that theres been progress in our plans by no means is progress done but we never expected that in three years wed reform our system
473559 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
473560 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
473561 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
473562 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
473563 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
473564 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
473565 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

473571 they demanded we hand over our wallets i think they look for any excuse to hook into tourists
473572 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period
473573 i tried to run but it was very late at night and we were in a secluded part of the island with no one else around to help i was bashed so severely that my eye socket was smashed to pieces requiring major surgery when i returned to london where i am currently living

473597 once you have to choose between eating and fuel theres nothing greater than going back to the beginning and making your own

473620 my bet is the authorities wont let them out until after the olympics
473621 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
473622 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
473623 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games
473624 it is a new low for the international community to see all these state leaders going to beijing without saying anything about the repressive environment in which the games are being held
473625 thousands of people including petitioners who have gone to beijing seeking justice from the government have been swept up in efforts to clean up the city before the games
473626 they said they were hired by the hospital and surveillance will last for the next four months it is said the olympics are approaching so they worry about us petitioners

473735 then they started showing them the work they were doing for school the reports they wrote the pictures they took the notes they compiled and the fathers had actual proof that their kids were learning

473765 as things stand perhaps to look at an inflation rate of 8 9 per cent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009

474080 a igreja tamb m hoje corre o risco de limitar o an ncio de jesus cristo queles que continuam no seu redil compreendem a sua linguagem e conhecem as suas leis

474100 the most encouraging thing is she has been listened to
474101 i think theres a recognition she has a lot of supporters out there and they need to reach out as shes reaching out to him obama
474102 weve worked together and there are a number of clinton supporters on the platform committee itself

474105 there are roughly 225 000 more people living with h i v in the united states than previously suspected the previous estimate was 1 million to 1 1 million
474106 u s efforts to prevent h i v have failed dismally
474107 we are not effectively reaching men who have sex with men and african americans to lower their risk
474108 it looks like prevention campaigns make even less difference than anyone thought
474109 h i v incidence did not decline as much from the 1980s to the 1990s as we believed despite the dramatic increase in condom promotion and so called prevention education

474124 is it too predictable to order wiener schnitzel in a german restaurant
474125 but then i thought no too touristy too safe a choice even if the dish did represent about the only two words in german that i could actually pronounce without embarrassing myself
474126 moreover i still retained the unpleasant memory of another schnitzel ordered the day before at a busy lunch spot off unter den linden which had proved to be a gooey over breaded tasteless mess
474127 if you ask me whether i am prepared to stand against anwar ibrahim i would say that i am ready and i would not reject such an offer victory or defeat is not the main thing more importantly it is opposing anwar as a team to uphold the truth
474128 that is why i say do not talk of victory or defeat to me and do not scare me with the constituency of permatang pauh do not challenge me because i am a fighter and i will fight

474144 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
474145 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
474146 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
474147 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
474148 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
474149 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
474150 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
474151 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
474152 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
474153 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
474154 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
474155 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
474156 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
474157 sen john mccain of arizona is the only republican who promises to end the george bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
474158 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
474159 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper
474160 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
474161 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances
474162 for starters their editorials are decidedly liberal thats a no brainer and there are often complaints that even their general reporting is biased in subtle and not so subtle ways the new york times has come to be associated with the northeast liberal establishment
474163 you might get that base but you wont win the election
474164 it goes back to the old saying dont throw rocks at people who own ink barrels and people have gotten sick and tired of the excuse that all media is liberal
474165 american accents hahaha i never thought i ever would hear that hahah anyway a good night and the moral of the story help people out you never know what will happen
474166 the mark of christianity is the paradox the absolute paradox
474167 if subjectivity is truth and subjectivity is the existing subjectivity then if i may put it this way christianity is a perfect fit subjectivity culminates in passion christianity is paradox paradox and passion fit each other perfectly and paradox perfectly fits a person situated in the extremity of existence
474168 you cant run a government and you cant run a company or anything like that unless everybody is on side
474169 if they are not on side he should kick them out and then what he should do is tell the rest of the world that he has been appointed to do a job for two years and let me get on with it and then at the end of that period of time judge me then
474170 its very easy for people to blame the top man when things are no good but what you have to look deeper are is what these problems are
474171 its not just recently that i have backed gordon brown
474172 ive known him for a long time as chancellor and i have got to know him quite well and out of the last four prime ministers that i have had the pleasure to have met i think he is a very very clever man and a man who is over everything and knows what is going on
474173 he may not come across as some kind of actor of some kind but he has got his hand on the pulse
474174 i can confirm that usain will run both the 100m 200m in beijing
474175 i think it is absolutely vital that we be at the cutting edge particularly third level education we are not there we are far from it
474176 you are either going to have to do it through taxation or through fees but it is a political taboo subject because it means you are attacking the very issue of free third level education across the board
474177 but there is no way that the wealthier part of society and those who are going to benefit significantly shouldnt have an obligation to contribute to creating a world class education system
474178 you bet i wanted to make sure that we protected ourselves at home secondly our foreign policy has been robust in the far east our relations with your country south korea with japan and with china have never been better and it took a lot of work to get bilateral relations as strong as they are

474184 our judgement is that this merciless attack was the work of the bloody separatist terror group
474185 those who helped those who gave shelter and those who took part in the attack have been caught
474186 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
474187 man too may be somewhat responsible for the cooling trend the university of wisconsins reid a bryson and other climatologists suggest that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth

474199 une reponse a ceux qui essaient de trouver des contradictions dans le coran
474200 il se trouve que si le coran dit que les montagnes bougent il dit aussi quelles sont immobiles sourate 16 an nahl les abeilles 15 et il a implant des montagnes immobiles dans la terre afin quelle ne branle pas en vous emportant avec elle de m me que des rivi res et des sentiers pour que vous vous guidiez sourate 15 al hijr 20 et quant la terre nous lavons tal e et y avons plac des montagnes immobiles et y avons fait pousser toute chose harmonieusement proportionn e sourate 21 al anbiya les proph tes 31 et nous avons plac des montagnes fermes dans la terre afin quelle ne s branle pas en les entra nant et nous y avons plac des d fil s servant de chemins afin quils se guident sourate 27 an naml les fourmis 61 pas lui qui a tabli la terre comme lieu de s jour plac des rivi res travers elle lui a assign des montagnes fermes et tabli une s paration entre les deux mers y a t il donc une divinit avec allah non mais la plupart dentre eux ne savent pas le fait que le coran dise aussi que les montagnes sont immobiles mappara t tre un autre contre argument contre lid e que le coran parle de la tectonique des plaques

474227 but no matter what i do or what i get involved with in the end i just want to be known as a skater
474228 tony is such an iconic figure in these sports and thats not going to change
474229 the tony hawk brand still lives in so many ways from the huckjam to the video games to clothing and apparel becoming irrelevant certainly is not a concern of his
474230 we all understand too that it takes money to make things happen we want to take our show out on the road and showcase our talents and the only way to do that is through corporate sponsors and such
474231 i just maintain a consistent skating level so every time i go back im not afraid to try something that may be more difficult or more dangerous
474232 i imagine if i was 50 that might sound ridiculous but at the same time i never thought id be doing this at 40 and here i am at a top level and i love it as long as i feel like ive got my skills in check and i walk the walk im doing it on this level
474233 its frustrating but not so much that we havent won a race
474234 to me its more frustrating that we werent competitive to win a race earlier i really feel like over the last month weve made some big gains
474235 im getting to where i can count on one hand the guys that i started racing with
474236 theres just not a lot of guys out here from when i started so that makes you feel a little bit older
474237 i think jeff is still the best driver in the series
474238 he has been for a long time and i dont think hes lost a thing hes still as good as he ever was but i do think the competition has caught up to him
474239 the series is different now than it was when he was dominating but if you look next to you during a race and you see that 24 car you know youve got your hands full
474240 im excited to see where these gains put us as far as being in position to win some races
474241 we need a couple more weeks of some solid runs like weve been having i really feel like this team is starting to make some ground
474242 when you start the chase 20 30 or 70 points behind other guys thats tough to overcome i think we can win some races in the chase but to go out there and outperform those guys every weekend and make up all those points is tough to do
474243 i like the amount of respect i have and the experience ive been able to gain over the years
474244 i certainly have no regrets ive accomplished more than i thought i ever would im not sitting here going boy i wish i was 21 again im pretty happy with where things are
474245 things are changing weve got a lot of young kids that are in this sport now i was one at one time as long as you continue to bring young talent into this sport i think its a great thing ill deal with where i stand

474252 by obstructing these compromise proposals to investigate unsolved civil rights crimes and protect children without borrowing more money the senate leadership is denying justice to victims of the past present and future generations it is also sending a message that congress defiantly refuses to live within its means and will not even consider paying for new spending by cutting wasteful washington spending what we have seen this week is a cynical ploy from democratic leaders to use victims of crime diseases and other calamities as props in a partisan political campaign these tactics have embarrassed and discredited the senate and helped reinforce its nine percent approval rating
474253 the decision by senate democratic leaders to obstruct a compromise supported by alvin sykes the president of the emmett till justice campaign and senator dodd the sponsor of the bill is deplorable and indefensible the emmett till compromise would simply require senate democratic leaders to acknowledge that congress should live within its means like every american family the compromise would require the department of justice to prioritize existing funds in order to fund this effort this step was necessary because senate democratic leaders had no intention to fund this program this year even as they accused me of obstruction and harboring other base motives
474254 there is no reason for democratic leaders to insist that these bills pass only in the context of their so called tomnibus bill that was soundly rejected and viewed as an exercise in demagoguery and mindless partisanship democratic leaders can now explain why they have drawn a moral equivalence between victims of civil rights crimes and online predators on one side and botanical gardens and war of 1812 commemorations on the other side senators were elected to set priorities and no normal person would say these causes deserve equal attention
474255 senate democratic leaders also objected last night to legislation designed to protect children from online pornography and exploitation their only basis for objecting was their insistence that this legislation can only pass in a package that also includes legislation regulating the interstate commerce of non human primates
474256 i f there is a significant num ber of documented aliens aliens in ins records on the orange county voter registration rolls how many illegal or undocumented aliens may be regis tered to vote in orange county

474258 used their voters cards to obtain a myriad of benefits from social security to jobs with the de fense department
474259 respond to an inquiry by a federal state or local government agency seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any individual within the jurisdiction of the agency for any purpose autho rized by law by providing the requested verification or status information
474260 it is important to safeguard the confidentiality of each legal immigrant especially in light of the federal privacy act and the immigration and nationality act
474261 want to open a pandoras box if word got out that this is a substantial problem it could tie up all sorts of manpower there might be a few thou sand illegal voters in dallas for example but there could be tens of thousands in places like new york chicago or miami
474262 there is no way of check ing we have no access to any information about who is in the united states legally or otherwise
474263 revealed phony addresses and large numbers of registrants who admitted they were not u s citi zens
474264 and told that she was not to ask that question only whether the person wished to register to vote
474265 she then reapplied in 1997 again claiming to be a u s citizen and was again given a voter card which was again cancelled records show she was able to vote at least four times in general and primary elections
474266 elections decided by one two or just a handful of votes
474267 from a relatively small universe of individuals legal immigrants who seek to become citizens these numbers do not tell us how many illegal immigrants have regis tered and voted
474268 any alien to vote in any election held solely or in part for the purpose of electing a candidate for the office of president vice president presidential elector

474275 what was really special was coming down the last eight with that great support teeing up so early compared with leaders we still had a huge crowd and it was very special coming up 18 i hope it will be like that tomorrow
474276 my brother and i get into an argument with a taxi driver about getting our change back he got on his mobile phone and all of a sudden at least 15 greeks with baseball bats batons and chains appeared out of nowhere
474277 they demanded we hand over our wallets i think they look for any excuse to hook into tourists
474278 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period
474279 i tried to run but it was very late at night and we were in a secluded part of the island with no one else around to help i was bashed so severely that my eye socket was smashed to pieces requiring major surgery when i returned to london where i am currently living
474280 my whole eye orbit had to be reconfigured with three metal plates and 12 screws the experienced surgeon who operated on my eye told me that i was lucky to be alive and just as lucky to still have my eye

474304 miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practiced more
474305 it was hard work out there due to the pitch because it helped their spinners slow us up
474306 but we werent losing wickets which took some of the pressure off
474307 we missed a couple of run out chances at the end which proved costly we bowled well enough to win a game of cricket but full credit to andrew white who played some really tough shots under pressure
474308 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
474309 acreditamos que poder amos ter feito algo melhor mas no q1 e no q2 fomos muito precisos e no q3 decidimos n o tomar riscos e pensar para a corrida de amanh
474310 para a qualifica o t nhamos duas possibilidades uma era sermos agressivos e buscar as primeiras posi es e a outra n o no final decidimos pela segunda ao ver que n o ramos t o r pidos
474311 a corrida ser muito dif cil n o d para ultrapassar nosso ritmo n o foi brilhante durante o fim de semana todos os que est o nossa frente s o mais r pidos do que n s por isso n o conseguiremos super los nosso objetivo na prova ser arranhar os ltimos pontinhos

474317 em campo grande que tem o asfalto mais abrasivo n s testamos o desgaste dos compostos durante os treinos livres para ver o que pode acontecer na prova a mais longa do ano e provavelmente com sol forte
474318 which was a comfortable 15 to 17 points for most of last and this year has shrunk significantly
474319 n s tivemos uma corrida muito complicada em fun o dos problemas de freio eles n o estavam funcionando corretamente uma hora eram as rodas dianteiras que travavam outra hora as traseiras
474320 fiz um erro na minha tentativa final o que me custou um tempo precioso e minha passagem anterior n o foi tima isso explica o porqu estou em sexto
474321 claro que n o estou feliz largando da terceira fila minha prova j come ar complicada tentarei melhorar minha situa o pois o carro n o foi t o ruim hoje
474322 foi uma pena perder a q3 por t o pouco mas sab amos que seria dif cil
474323 estou feliz principalmente depois de completar apenas nove voltas durante toda a sexta isso significa que fizemos um bom trabalho neste s bado
474324 foi uma qualifica o muito boa para mim e estou obviamente feliz
474325 tivemos um bom come o nos treinos livres de sexta o time fez um grande trabalho de noite e escolhemos os pneus corretos para o nosso acerto na q2 tivemos um carro perfeito

474363 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
474364 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
474365 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
474366 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up

474379 at present there are at least 80 neonatal intensive care level 3 cots with capacity to increase depending on staffing what this figure doesnt show is the flexibility that our neo natal system has to provide additional care
474380 following a 2004 review of neonatal care this government expanded the provision of neo natal care in 2006 middlemore hospital had its capacity doubled from 6 to 12 intensive care cots and level 3 cot numbers will increase to 86 from early 2009 when both wellington and hamilton neonatal units open

474382 how long did he take zyprexa for and what happened
474383 go off of the drug and she will kill herself
474384 because it speaks symbolically to what is important to national that new zealanders get to keep more of what they earn that they face better incentives and that ultimately we believe in a smaller state and less intrusion in their lives
474385 thats a programme we want rolled out straight away we remain deeply concerned about the one in five new zealanders that we see leaving school with inadequate literacy and numeracy skills
474386 we have made some clear choices and you will see that when you see our tax cut programme
474387 the main aspect of policy is going to be around infrastructure
474388 while we wouldnt borrow for tax cuts were not opposed to borrowing for infrastructure
474389 new zealand doesnt have a debt problem it has a growth problem
474390 it will be tangible evidence that were serious about what we want
474391 were not averse to the private sector playing a role in a number of areas and driving productivity for us
474392 thats our aim over time its two fold firstly clearly tax has some initial implications but we all understand the limitations of the tax system
474393 but secondly if we can drive productivity over time we can drive higher wages if you really want to lift wages weve got to equip new zealanders with the skills to take on jobs which are more productive we need to give them the environment that will allow us to grow
474394 i dont think there really ever is in terms of economic performance
474395 our argument really is about wanting to make an economic step change which captures the huge growth opportunities that sit in the medium to long term in new zealand its about preparing the economy
474396 i do think that notwithstanding the economic slowdown at the moment the global economy will double in the next 25 years it will be driven out of asia and it will be hitting the sweet spot of what new zealand has the potential to play a really key role in that is production of food tourism and ultimately niche type industries which are service based or technology based
474397 that provides for controlling spending and controlling increases in taxes after two years of surpluses the surplus would be refunded to the taxpayers right now its spent which increases spending for the next cycle we need to get some kind of controls on spending taxes are not the issue spending is the issue

474440 ten years ago the internet was one tenth as fast as it is today and it was perfectly adequate and society worked perfectly well
474441 but with 10 times faster the opportunities to move all sorts of new data like video and voice and presence through the network immediately arose
474442 so this is a case where we were choking off imagination
474443 its as if weve changed from am radio to fm radio and the improved fidelity means we can put more information into the same bandwidth
474444 its as if on a highway weve squeezing four or even eight cars in the place where one car would have been otherwise
474445 of course if we were to try to do this without the digital signal processing we use at both ends of the link then thered be an awful pileup

474536 these are tough conditions up here it was hot north queensland played some pretty good footy
474537 we werent doing a lot of things right in the first half but the other team looked a little bit more willing than we did
474538 it was a bit disappointing from a point of view that i thought we had more to play for
474539 it was a major turning point in the game that penalty

474554 from day one ive thought it seems like hes troubled
474555 i would like to understand why he has done this if he had a change of heart then certainly we would want to sit down and listen to him
474556 we would want to see him back in the nrl and we would want to see him happy if sonny was to say hes sorry for what he did and admit that he made a mistake we would definitely be a party to hearing him out

474569 i didnt want to keep him out of the team for too much longer because you start to lose that match fitness as far as first grade goes
474570 we put the pressure on him a little bit over the past few weeks putting him as 18th man and playing a few premier league games
474571 its a great story during the week when he didnt play last week i was sitting in my office early in the week and he came up the stairs and hed been doing an extra training session over and above what the other guys were doing and he walked in with sweat dripping off him
474572 he said whats happening with the team this week im ready to go give me a shot at it it was a great example of what it takes and the desire he has got and its great to have people like that at your club
474573 ive been busting my balls to get back in there and get an opportunity and youve just got to take it
474574 its pretty tough but you have to do what you can do you can do it two ways you can just go round kicking stones or you can put pressure on the guys that are on the team

474588 the gold coast will get their own side soon and im sure they will support them
474589 i thought deja vu was a movie but its real life for us
474590 i thought we played well but we had three goal scorers and nine behind kickers so instead of having a big lead we had a little lead and then they were able to get us at the finish

474594 i told the team that they should put every effort into winning this game for this man because hes been such an important person for the club
474595 as an on field role model he has been amazing a little bit of who we are is because of people like him
474596 weve still got a way to go we know that and we understand that

474633 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
474634 our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
474635 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
474636 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
474637 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
474638 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
474639 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
474640 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
474641 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances

474651 mom showed me shes trying to come home remember the spell she sent this ahead to show the way
474652 well you had better stand back we do not know if pallas has perfected any of her magic yet
474653 just thinking maybe the aroma might help mom focus a bit

474695 like i said a week ago i was very confident the guys that usually hit would hit again i didnt want to be disparaging at all to the guys that have put us in the spot were in its unfair to make a deal just to make a deal and eliminate playing time for a very productive player it just didnt make any sense i wasnt in the aggressive mode at all the last couple of days i just sat around thursday did hardly anything and just watched the game
474696 the move they made with oakland acquiring harden and gaudin was the best move we couldve made i think were fine with what weve got

474745 the fact that hes a human being not an alien not someone given super powers thats what makes him an everyman hero
474746 hes single mindedly dedicated to the pursuit of justice and that raises all these ethical concerns is he doing right or wrong
474747 hes stronger and faster and smarter than everyone else but all that he does is within the realm of human possibility
474748 but he also has the flaws of a human being hes not a very nice person hes not out to scare children but to scare criminals he has to scare everybody hes not a team player his mission shuts him off from other people and forces him to make sacrifices

474750 we would prefer an enemy who makes sense evil for the sake of evil without any other purpose unnerves us even the figure of satan doesnt do that satan has an agenda he understands the value of humans and he works out of spite or anger that makes more sense to us than someone who as the movie says just wants to see the world burn
474751 this is part of the broader human condition that we enjoy watching evil

474755 president dmitrii medvedev has provided few details about his proposed attack on corruption some critics including indem foundation president georgii satarov believe his interest in establishing the rule of law grows from a desire to legitimize property acquired by kremlin insiders and their loyal collaborators during the putin year

474757 when the plan is finalized we need to switch to legislative work so that the plan becomes a set of laws in say half a year
474758 russia should start the new year with modern anti corruption legislation of which we will not be ashamed
474759 corruption has become a way of life for a huge number of people
474760 those who accept bribes carry no responsibility this should not be the case
474761 the plan envisages handing over some of the functions from a federal level to the regions and from the state to the private sector
474762 despite revealing some details of his plan medvedev left lots of things out of the public eye
474763 the best thing he can do now is to make public the full text of the plan and put it to open debate by experts and the public such things need full transparency

474778 the dream to provide electricity across the country by signing the indo us nuclear deal is not true
474779 nuclear power is not a safe affordable or better option for producing electricity rather nuclear power is a very dangerous and expensive option the indo us nuclear deal is actually a political and military deal

474781 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
474782 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
474783 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
474784 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured

474797 the founding fathers did not envision a freedom from religion rather a freedom of religion
474798 the freedom of religion means that no one has the right to attack malign or grossly offend a faith tradition they personally do not have membership or ascribe allegiance
474799 individual freedoms are limited by the boundaries created by the inalienable rights of others
474800 i am catholic i find homosexuality offensive to my religion there is a homosexual who is not catholic therefore they have no right to be homosexual they are violating my rights
474801 individual freedoms are limited by the boundaries created by the inalienable rights of others
474802 that inalienable right being the right not to be or even to feel offended by others their own words not mine

474809 being a worship pastor is much more than singing and getting along with people is much more than having music skills and proficiency in singing is having in your heart the desire of gods presence no matter what it takes is using your music skills to drawn him nearer to us as his church but beyond it all its giving your own life for him and sharing his in you with others obedience and passion

474827 ik weet dat we voor een zware opdracht staan maar het loont de moeite
474828 dat ik vandaag kon winnen heb ik in eerste instantie aan de ploeg rond mij te danken onvoorstelbaar hoe sterk we waren iedereen mee in de ontsnapping van ruim veertig man behalve ikzelf en vladimir karpets met de hulp van pablo lastras en alberto losada konden we nog orde op zaken stellen daarna hebben we de finale naar onze hand gezet bettini rebellin moncouti en popovych bebben met aanvallen geprobeerd om ons klein te krijgen maar het is ze niet gelukt er lag een zware verantwoordelijkheid op mijn schouders om vervolgens niet te falen in de eindspurt maar ik had het niet eens moeilijk om het te halen ik had meer tegenstand verwacht vooral van bettini
474829 op nu naar de olympische spelen misschien hebben we met spanje wel de sterkste ploeg van allemaal contador heeft de giro gewonnen sastre de tour waarin freire en sanchez ook sterk gepresteerd hebben eigenlijk zijn we alle vijf sterk genoeg voor een medaille de kwaadste klant om te bekampen wordt naar mijn gevoel stefan schumacher en bettini mag je natuurlijk nooit onderschatten
474830 misschien speelt het superlastige parcours wel in ons voordeel met de warmte de vochtigheid en de luchtvervuiling er bovenop wordt het een lastige koers maar we mogen met vertrouwen vertrekken het spaanse vijftal moet bekwaam geacht worden om met een medaille naar huis te komen liefst de gouden
474831 de honda cr v is in het echt nog mooier dan verwacht
474832 mijn eerste indruk was amaai bij mijn vertrek moest ik de zetel goed zetten en dat ging elektrisch in de audi moet dat manueel veelbelovend mij was het model eerder nog niet opgevallen veel zag je m ook nog niet toen ik hem meekreeg we zijn dan maar eens op de website gaan kijken in het echt was hij nog mooier dan verwacht heel donkere lak met een parelmoerschijntje prachtig gewoon iedereen zei dat ook
474833 de cr v houdt zowat het midden tussen break en jeep ik zie daar de voordelen wel van in het is een praktische en gebruiksvriendelijke auto waar je vlot in en uitstapt hij is niet te hoog niet te laag en knap van lijn en afwerking mijn vader die hem teruggebracht heeft was al even enthousiast
474834 er zaten heel wat james bond achtige snufjes in adaptieve cruise control bijvoorbeeld een camera die parkeerhulp bood allerlei knopjes aan het stuur een gebruiksvriendelijke gps de software moet gloednieuw geweest zijn want hij herkende zelfs een heel recente nieuwbouwwijk ik hou wel van die extras ik leef haast in de auto en dan mag wat verwennerij wel
474835 ik vond dat panoramisch dak ook geweldig het lijkt wel of de zon binnenschijnt en het interieur wordt er veel lichter door fleur 2 heeft er ook van genoten zon dak zou ik ook willen de cr v lijkt misschien niet zo groot maar is het wel vooral binnenin en de koffer die leek oneindig boodschappen een buggy het ging er allemaal in
474836 natuurlijk is er verschil tussen de cr v en de audi al zijn het geen autos die je met elkaar kunt vergelijken natuurlijk zo zijn de deuren van de audi duidelijk zwaarder en ik denk ook dat er een kwaliteitsverschil is in de lak maar ik was aardig verrast door de kwaliteit en het rijplezier van deze japanner

474838 t is een perfecte gezinswagen met een originele en sportieve look goedkoop is hij niet de basisprijs valt wel mee maar als je meer aankleding wilt dan wordt hij erg duur en dan is maar de vraag of hij een aanvaardbare restwaarde houdt

474902 i invited all my friends here to party at my house
474903 i spent time buying a lot of beer and they wont even let anyone drive on state street to get here everyone has to walk a long distance
474904 some of my friends wouldnt come because they heard the cops were strip searching everyone
474905 at first they wouldnt let us put a foot in the street or they would yell at us and tell us to get in a yard

474917 we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices
474918 we do not tell providers how to manage their networks they might choose for instance to prioritize voice over ip calls in analyzing whether comcast violated federal policy when it blocked access to certain applications we conduct a fact specific inquiry into whether the management practice they used was reasonable based on many reasons including the arbitrary nature of the blocking the lack of relation to times of congestion or size of files and the manner in which they hid their conduct from their subscribers we conclude it was not
474919 we do not limit providers efforts to stop congestion we do say providers should disclose what they are doing to consumers

474976 dieses team wird noch sehr lange das williams team sein nat rlich werden patrick und ich auch lter aber der plan ist dass adam parr und sam michael die kontrolle bernehmen die n chste generation wenn sie so wollen
474977 er ist eine sehr weiche person die formel 1 w re wahrscheinlich nichts f r ihn
474978 wir verfolgen zwei unterschiedliche programme eines davon ist weit weniger stark gewichtet als das andere
474979 das n chstj hrige auto wird einfacher aussehen und es wird meiner meinung nach langsamer sein
474980 ganz so klar ist es uns noch nicht wir haben noch nicht verstanden was unser problem ist beziehungsweise wie wir es l sen k nnen
474981 wir ziehen es nicht in betracht den partner zu wechseln solange uns toyota beliefern m chte
474982 hij gaat de dubbel proberen te halen dat is zeker ik heb net de bevestiging van zijn trainer ontvangen
474983 ich bin nat rlich extrem entt uscht das ist die schlechteste startposition seit einer halben ewigkeit und nur weil bourdais mir im weg stand
474984 in dieser runde musste ich drei autos berholen die auf ihrer outlap waren und mich schon einiges an zeit gekostet haben ich habe einiges verloren auch wenn sie versucht haben platz zu machen zum schluss der runde waren dann webber mark webber anm d red bourdais und fisi giancarlo fisichella anm d red vor mir
474985 offensichtlich wussten webber und fisichella dass ich auf einer schnellen runde war und haben versucht gas zu geben bourdais wusste das allem anschein nach nicht und stand mitten in der letzten kurve vor mir ich bin dann sogar noch neben die strecke gekommen er ist zwar bestraft worden aber das n tzt ja nun nichts mehr
474986 ber das wochenende lief es eigentlich recht gut speziell da wir gestern noch ein paar ver nderungen vorgenommen haben wenn man sieht dass robert vierter ist dann w re ich wohl in einem hnlichen bereich gewesen auf einer strecke wie budapest von p15 zu starten ist eigentlich fast aussichtslos
474987 ich hatte schon am kurveneingang weniger grip und weniger anpressdruck weil ich so nahe dran war ich habe dann probiert trotzdem noch alles aus dem auto herauszuholen der verlust an downforce war aber so gro dass ich auch noch neben die strecke gekommen bin
474988 der startplatz ist hier die halbe miete rgert es dich dass du nicht fr her rausgefahren bist so wie andere das vorgemacht haben
474989 wir h tten reagieren k nnen wenn etwas schiefgegangen w re das haben wir auch getan denn ich bin davor schon auf ein anderes auto aufgefahren und brachte keine richtige runde zustande
474990 wir hatten anschlie end noch die zeit ein zweites outing zu fahren wobei wir da eher zu fr h als zu sp t dran waren ich war n mlich auf meiner fliegenden runde wobei fast alle auf ihrer outlap waren wie gesagt ich musste drei autos berholen drei waren vor mir und einer hat mich aufgehalten ich war da komplett aus dem normalen timing raus das hat es letztendlich versaut
474991 was kannst du morgen noch retten was ist in punkto strategie noch m glich
474992 f r mich sind das zwei verschiedene paar schuhe die motivation und der wille nach vorne zu kommen sind berhaupt kein problem
474993 trotzdem ist die wahrscheinlichkeit nicht sonderlich gro denn wie wir wissen ist es beraus schwierig in budapest zu berholen safety car phasen hat es hier in den vergangenen jahren auch nicht besonders viele gegeben es ist also auch unwahrscheinlich dass wir aus dieser position heraus noch etwas gl ck haben
474994 ja ich denke man h tte mich sp ter rauslassen sollen das werden wir uns aber genau anschauen wie immer
474995 auch deine erste runde war nicht perfekt was war da los
474996 der erste sektor war noch recht gut doch dann bin ich in kurve vier ein bisschen neben die strecke gekommen da war die runde dann leider vorbei und in der zweiten runde waren die reifen schon nicht mehr so gut
474997 in den rennen wo du von weiter hinten starten musstest warst du in dieser saison bislang immer recht gut unterwegs hier k nnte das anders aussehen zumal man kaum eine safety car phase erwarten kann oder
474998 erstens das zum zweiten ist es hier schwieriger zu berholen au erdem stehe ich hier weiter hinten
474999 jetzt hattest du dich in der qualifikation wieder herangek mpft wie hart trifft dich da dieser r ckschlag
475000 gerade deshalb ist das nat rlich sehr rgerlich ich habe den speed das wei ich das haben wir in den vergangenen rennen gesehen das ist nat rlich ein herber r ckschlag zumal ich das ziel ausgegeben habe vierter in der meisterschaft werden zu wollen aus dieser position punkte herauszufahren wird nicht gerade einfach sein
475001 du hattest in deiner ersten runde einen fehler warum dann so lange warten und nicht schon fr her einen weiteren versuch starten und dabei freie strecke haben
475002 du kannst ja nicht davon ausgehen dass du immer zehn fehler baust die strecke ist einfach hintenraus schneller sodass wir nicht auf der vermeintlich langsameren piste fahren wollen
475003 man schaut einfach dass man ein bisschen im rhythmus mit den anderen fahrern ist diesen fehler haben wir gemacht wir hatten ja die m glichkeit ein zweites outing zu fahren was auch gereicht h tte du planst aber sicher nicht dass du dreimal auf die strecke musst das ist einfach nicht normal
475004 ja wir haben uns oben bei den stewards gesehen und er hat sich entschuldigt das ist in ordnung so etwas kann nun einmal passieren mich hat es halt wahrscheinlich das rennen gekostet dass er das nicht extra gemacht hat ist auch klar
475005 nun wie wir heute gesehen haben sind die meisten auf der prime mischung deutlich schneller das hat sich auch in q3 gezeigt wo wieder mehr sprit an bord ist je schwerer das auto ist umso mehr grip b t du am ende der runde ein
475006 ich hatte von rundenmitte bis zum ende graining vor allem vorne haben sie nachgelassen das war das hauptproblem
475007 ich hatte am freitag noch probleme vor allem am kurveneingang
475008 auch der verkehr hat mich gestern ein wenig gehindert wir haben die dinge mit dem motorrad am samstag gut in den griff bekommen pirelli hat gut gearbeitet und uns perfekte mischungen geliefert wenn man bedenkt dass sich die piste vom haftungsniveau her ziemlich verschlechtert hat
475009 in brands hatch z hlt die erfahrung mehr als auf anderen pisten
475010 obwohl ich im jahr 2007 erstmals hier war lief es schon am freitag von beginn an gut und ich war nahe an der spitze dran
475011 de onbetaalde huurprijzen worden afgetrokken van het bedrag dat aan de politiezone verschuldigd is door de federale overheid zo werden de onbetaalde huurprijzen voor de jaren 2004 en 2005 in rekening gebracht bij de betaling voor 2006 het gedeelte dat niet kan worden afgehouden door voornoemde aftrek kan worden afgehouden van de volgende dotatie aan de politiezone
475012 ich glaube schon dass es ber die distanz hinweg etwas konstanter ist was den abtrieb auf der hinterachse betrifft
475013 wir haben das am freitag probiert aber da waren die windverh ltnisse schon wieder anders da war es schwierig zu deuten ich habe mich damit wohl gef hlt deswegen haben wir ist draufgelassen
475014 in hockenheim hatten wir ein kleines update gehabt das ganz positiv war in jerez haben wir nicht wirklich neue teile ausprobiert nur diese motoren abdeckung aber das war es dann auch
475015 man muss sagen dass es f r hier gepasst hat ob es auch f r valencia passt ist die frage
475016 hier hat alles zusammen gepasst deshalb stehen wir relativ weit vorne
475017 ich bin damit ber das jahr hinweg nicht so zufrieden dass unsere qualifyings sehr inkonstant waren manchmal hat es uns in die top 10 gereicht manchmal nicht hier hat alles zusammen gepasst deshalb stehen wir relativ weit vorne wir m ssen einfach diesbez glich eine konstanz hinein bringen dahinter steht f r mich noch ein fragezeichen wir haben im qualifying einfach zu viele h hen und tiefen
475018 nat rlich sch n vor kimi r ikk nen zu stehen
475019 aber wir m ssen einmal abwarten welche taktik ferrari morgen f hrt ich sch tze dass er etwas schwerer unterwegs ist vielleicht sogar wie der rest es ist nat rlich sch n vor ihm zu stehen aber es ist nichts weswegen ich freuden spr nge mache
475020 ich w rde mich mehr freuen wenn wir jetzt nun auch einmal die konstanz f r den rest des jahres hinein bringen w rden
475021 ich freue mich nat rlich ber den f nften rang das war mal ein schritt aber ich w rde mich mehr freuen wenn wir jetzt nun auch einmal die konstanz f r den rest des jahres hinein bringen w rden da w rde ich mich mehr dar ber freuen als ber ein einzelnes resultat
475022 auf manchen strecken speziell wenn es sehr warm ist bekomme ich den reifen so zum arbeiten wie ich mir das vorstelle
475023 vielleicht hat es damit etwas zu tun wir hatten schon viele wochenenden wie in malaysia oder in australien wo wir im qualifying gut waren in der t rkei waren wir sehr gut aufgestellt hatten das auto genauso wie ich es jetzt hier hatte
475024 wenn man sich die video aufnahmen anschaut dann kann man genau sehen dass ich das auto dorthin lenken kann wo ich es haben m chte wenn das passt dann kann ich ein gutes qualifying fahren und auch mal alles aus dem auto jede hundertstelsekunde herausholen das kann ich nicht machen wenn ich nicht 100 prozentig wei was das auto macht momentan ist das auto immer gleich das ist ein vorteil
475025 wenn es k lter wird dann sieht es vielleicht schon wieder ganz anders aus
475026 ich bin gespannt wie wir morgen am start wegkommen und wie sich speziell der reifen verh lt
475027 dahinter habe ich noch ein fragezeichen stehen welcher reifen wirklich funktionieren wird weil wenn es k lter wird dann sieht es vielleicht schon wieder ganz anders aus ich hoffe dass das auto gut ber die distanz ist
475028 ich kann das gar nicht richtig erkl ren ich habe vorhin mal gesagt dass er sich anf hlt wie kaugummi er bewegt sich in sich relativ viel manchmal sp rt man die zus tzliche haftung des weicheren reifens aber erst in der mitte der kurve
475029 ich wei manchmal wirklich nicht wie ich einen reifen anfahren soll
475030 es f hlt sich danach an als brauche er extrem lang bis er sich gesetzt hat und stabil ist es ist ziemlich schwierig ein gef hl daf r zu bekommen wenn man auf der runde aus der box hinaus zu schnell ist dann kann es sein dass man auf der fliegenden runde graining hat ich wei manchmal wirklich nicht wie ich einen reifen anfahren soll mit dem h rteren reifen hatte ich ein ganz anderes gef hl
475031 die frage ist wie schnell er sich stabilisiert ich kann mir schon vorstellen dass er sich nach vier oder f nf runden zu stabilisieren beginnt du aber immer das schwammige gef hl im auto hast da er vom aufbau her weicher ist das k nnte ber die distanz ein problem sein
475032 ich w rde sagen dass im zweiten qualifying teil alle mit relativ wenig sprit an bord unterwegs waren da war ich auf platz zwei so weit waren wir also nicht weg
475033 im dritten qualifying teil w re mehr drin gewesen wenn ich meinen reifen auf der runde aus der box heraus besser h tte aufw rmen k nnen das habe ich aber nicht machen k nnen da der robert kubica eine etwas langsamere runde gefahren ist da habe ich ein bisschen zeit verloren wir m ssen schauen was die anderen morgen machen ich denke jedoch dass wir von der strategie her in jenem fenster sind was die anderen machen
475034 de vooruitzichten dat ze erdoor komt zien er niet goed uit
475035 wie erwartet ging es im qualifying zum gro en preis von ungarn sehr eng zu
475036 von beginn an lag das feld in der zeitenliste dicht beisammen deswegen bin ich sehr froh dass wir es mit beiden renault r28 in die runde der besten zehn geschafft haben dennoch rechne ich mit einem sehr schwierigen rennen aber ich bin fest gewillt budapest mit wm punkten im gep ck wieder zu verlassen
475037 dieses abschlusstraining war ziemlich hart umk mpft h rter als ich es mir zuvor ausgerechnet hatte
475038 trotzdem bin ich ins letzte drittel vorgedrungen und sehr froh dar ber denn dadurch haben wir uns eine sehr gute ausgangsposition f r das rennen erarbeitet ich hoffe dass ich das beste daraus machen kann und habe mir wm punkte zum ziel gesetzt
475039 wie immer hat es sich auch hier auf dem hungaroring ausgezahlt dass wir die drei freien trainingssitzungen daf r nutzen konnten unsere hausaufgaben sorgf ltig zu erledigen
475040 wir sind mit beiden renault r28 in das dritte segment des qualifyings vorgesto en
475041 die treibstoffmengen mit denen wir den grand prix in angriff nehmen sollten uns vielf ltige m glichkeiten er ffnen jeder wei wie schwierig es auf dieser engen strecke ist jemanden zu berholen diese tatsache haben wir bei der wahl unserer renntaktik hinsichtlich der boxenstopps denen eine entscheidende bedeutung zukommt nat rlich ber cksichtigt
475042 wir hatten es uns zum ziel gesetzt hier in ungarn w hrend des qualifyings mit beiden renault r28 den sprung unter die schnellsten zehn zu schaffen dieser plan ist aufgegangen
475043 du feierst deinen neuen vertrag und das ist eine gro artige leistung von dir in der ersten reihe zu stehen
475044 ja absolut das auto hat sich in den vergangenen paar rennen stark angef hlt und ich denke dass wir in der lage waren das paket beim vergangenen test und im verlauf des wochenendes mehr und mehr zu verbessern es war also nur die frage dies im qualifying umzusetzen
475045 es war schwierig den richtigen reifen zu w hlen ich hatte ebenfalls vor den weichen reifen im letzten teil des qualifyings mit viel benzin an bord zu verwenden aber wir ver nderten unsere meinung als alle anderen mit dem h rteren reifen schnell fuhren durch die sich ver ndernden bedingungen war der h rtere reifen vielleicht der favorit aber abgesehen davon ist es von allen eine gro artige leistung morgen sollte es ein interessantes rennen geben
475046 inwiefern hat sich die strecke entwickelt wie werden die wetter bedingungen sein wie wird die reifen wahl ausfallen
475047 in bezug auf die wetter vorhersage ist es schwierig eine auskunft zu geben alles was ich sagen kann ist dass es hei werden wird es sollte keinerlei regen geben vielleicht ein wenig ber nacht aber morgen sollte es trocken sein
475048 wir werden eine strecke sehen die sich bis gegen ende des rennens weiter entwickelt sie wird mehr und mehr haftung bekommen und abseits der ideallinie wird es schmutziger werden wir k nnen also kein rad neben die ideallinie setzen das wird morgen entscheidend sein
475049 du hast heute morgen gesagt dass eine reine erste mclaren mercedes reihe ideal w re aber wom glich meintest du nicht in dieser reihenfolge du bist aber wohl gl cklich ber das was du erreicht hast oder
475050 ja ich denke dies ist f r das team ein gro artiges ergebnis sie haben wirklich intensiv druck gemacht um unser auto zu verbessern und wir haben in den vergangenen paar monaten betr chtliche schritte nach vorn gemacht es ist gut dass wir eine gute richtung gefunden haben in die wir in bezug auf die entwicklung gehen m ssen
475051 nat rlich w rde ich es immer vorziehen auf der pole zu stehen aber um ehrlich zu sein war lewis hier das ganze wochenende ber stark w hrend der vergangenen paar rennen war er stark gewesen er leistete heute bessere arbeit ich denke jedoch dass ich mich nach wie vor in einer guten position befinde wie wir erw hnt haben sollte es morgen ein interessantes rennen geben und ich denke dass wir auch eine gute m glichkeit haben sollten ein starkes rennen zu fahren
475052 wie stark hast du dein auto nach dem heutigen morgen oder im verlauf der einheit heute morgen ver ndert
475053 nicht sehr stark wir hatten einfach versucht die reifen zu vergleichen und ein klares bild zu bekommen der urspr ngliche plan war es gewesen im letzten teil des qualifying den weicheren reifen zu verwenden aber der unterschied zwischen ihnen war nicht sehr gro im zweiten teil des qualifying sahen wir dass einige unserer gegner mit dem h rteren betr chtlich schneller fuhren vielleicht verschoben sich da die bedingungen leicht in richtung des h rteren reifens wir entschieden uns dann mit ihm zu fahren beide reifen w ren meiner meinung nach f r uns eine sichere wahl gewesen wenn es zwischen den reifen so eng zugeht dann ist es eine schwierige wahl aber am ende ist es eine leichte wahl denn es gibt zwischen ihnen keinen gro en unterschied
475054 im vergangenen jahr entschieden sich ziemlich viele fahrer f r eine drei boxenstopp strategie ist deine strategie nun ziemlich einfach wo du aus der ersten reihe startest
475055 nat rlich kann ich dir meine strategie nicht verraten das ist sehr vertraulich und du wirst es morgen herausfinden m ssen ich kann sagen dass ich denke dass unsere geschwindigkeit das ganze wochenende ber sehr stark war und ich nicht sehen kann warum wir uns in bezug auf die strategie in irgendeiner schw cheren position befinden sollten meiner meinung nach sind wir so stark wie unsere gegner und ich f hle mich im hinblick auf unsere strategie wohl morgen werden wir jedoch sehen wie es ablaufen wird
475056 du hast wohl auf deinem letzten versuch im ersten sektor etwas zeit verloren kannst du beschreiben was dort passierte und wie gl cklich du mit deiner runde generell warst
475057 ich habe bereits ber den funk an das team berichtet dass ich denke dass ich in der zweiten kurve etwas vorsichtig war es war schwierig dort die richtige balance zwischen der tatsache zu finden dass man am eingang zeit gutmacht und am ausgang nicht verliert zu finden ich denke dass ich dort wohl auf meiner besten runde etwas zeit verloren habe aber die kurvenmitte war ziemlich gut
475058 man verliert und gewinnt immer etwas jeder hat diese kleinen momente alles in allem denke ich dass ich ber die runde ziemlich gl cklich sein kann es gab meiner meinung nach keine gro en fehler lediglich diese kleinen einstellungen alle fahrer k nnen nach jedem qualifying immer sagen dass man dieses und jenes h tte tun k nnen aber dies tats chlich zu tun ist ganz sch n schwierig
475059 machst du dir irgendwelche sorgen dass du deine position auf der schmutzigeren seite der startaufstellung verteidigen musst
475060 ja das ist nicht ideal aber es ist besser vor den anderen leuten zu stehen um ehrlich zu sein erwartete ich schon in hockenheim dass es ein gr erer unterschied sein w rde aber das war nicht der fall ich hoffe aus diesem grund dass dies hier ebenfalls der fall sein wird
475061 ich werde mich diesbez glich nicht selbst unter stress setzen ich werde am start morgen so viel attackieren wie ich nur kann und wir werden sehen wie sich dies ausgeht aber ich werde deswegen keine schlaflose nacht haben
475062 was wird morgen am start dein ziel sein lewis zu berholen oder felipe zu kontrollieren und ihn hinter dir zu halten
475063 idealerweise beides wir werden mit lewis k mpfen und ich werde versuchen ihn zu berholen er wird jedoch versuchen sich zu verteidigen wir respektieren uns gegenseitig und am ende des tages sind wir angestellte des teams und wir versuchen den besten job zu leisten den wir f r das team erledigen k nnen
475064 no nigger is ever going on the air in washington
475065 we won it very comfortably and could have could have scored more but weve had a good day
475066 the last two weeks shaun whalley and jefferson louis have looked very sharp and looked as if they can score goals
475067 it was a good test playing against a premier league side from a tactical point of view youve got to be spot on
475068 i think after all the work we did in spain the boys did very well
475069 why just build a site when you could build a business
475070 hes just a pretty good actor who did away with himself and broke the hearts of his family and friends and he shouldnt get an academy award to memorialize his death each year more than 100 000 americans die of alcohol or drug abuse it would be madness to commemorate one such death with the greatest honor in cinema please give the academy award to someone whos had the courage to stick around
475071 well i guess that means the academy endorses the drugging and sexual exploitation of 13 year olds
475072 i guess that means the academy thought polanskis work merited an oscar
475073 all that anyone working on the movie want ed to talk about
475074 to lucas i say this wanna watch me make this pencil disappear
475075 if he doesnt win id like to see the performance that does

475103 dar a conocer el potencial art stico de la comunitat valenciana
475104 el gran objetivo es que el arte valenciano salga de la comunitat y viaje por espa a y hasta que cada a o las mejores propuestas salgan al extranjero
475105 una rampa de lanzamiento a nivel nacional e internacional para muchos artistas valencianos

475107 america is often portrayed as an ignorant unsophisticated sort of place full of bible bashers and ruled to a dangerous extent by trashy television superstition and religious bigotry a place lacking in respect for evidence based knowledge i know that is how it is portrayed because i have done my bit to paint that picture

475109 if smaller incremental toll increases are what the public wants it is a lot more likely to happen if you make them automatic than if you try to get a board to vote on them every year or every other year
475110 we think that we cant just write a blank check for toll increases
475111 put the question of toll hikes on the ballot and let us decide

475222 al recibir en sus corazones y as confesar con sus labios en la privacidad de sus oraciones frecuentes el nombre bendito de su jesucristo
475223 para servir y adorar cada d a a su padre celestial que est en los cielos
475224 ser redimido indiscutiblemente para dios y para su nuevo reino celestial de la nueva jerusal n santa y gloriosa del cielo por ejemplo

475227 la llenura de la luz infinita de la nueva vida de la humanidad entera
475228 para finalmente entrar a la nueva jerusal n real del cielo
475229 para que jam s tenga hambre ni sed en todos los d as de su vida
475230 como de problemas y enfermedades terribles en su vida humana de cada d a
475231 porque jesucristo no es su luz en sus vidas por ejemplo
475232 para que vea la verdadera vida eterna por la cual fue llamado de las profundas tinieblas de la tierra
475233 el nombre misterioso y todopoderoso de nuestro se or jesucristo para que sus habitantes ya no vivan en tinieblas sino en la paz de nuestro padre celestial
475234 visto que jam s honraron el esp ritu del nombre misterioso y sumamente honrado de nuestro nico salvador posible del para so
475235 porque el se or jesucristo no existe en sus vidas para nada
475236 las cuales han destruido la vida de muchas familias inocentes a trav s de los tiempos desdichadamente
475237 como t y yo hoy en d a en nuestros millares mi estimado hermano y hermana en toda la tierra
475238 y as no ver la luz del d a jam s

475241 primeramente somos descendientes directos e espirituales de nuestro padre celestial de su esp ritu santo y de su hijo amado nuestro gran rey mes as de todos los tiempos
475242 ellos piensan que pueden aliviar sus dolores s est n con nosotros
475243 es por eso que jesucristo los hecha fuera de nuestras vidas siempre
475244 pues son tinieblas y est n apartados de dios y de su vida antigua del cielo infinitamente
475245 pero nosotros somos de la luz de la misma vida santa de nuestro padre celestial y de su hijo el rey mes as
475246 somos descendientes directamente del coraz n sant simo de la mente sagrada del esp ritu de los diez mandamientos humanos y del alma divina de nuestro padre celestial y as tambi n por tanto somos descendientes de la carne de los huesos de la sangre viviente y sant sima del rbol de la vida su hijo amado nuestro se or jesucristo
475247 hemos nacido de la luz de la vida eterna de nuestro padre celestial de su hijo y de su esp ritu para jam s vivir la vida pecadora de satan s en esta vida ni en la venidera tampoco para siempre por ello no somos nunca felices en las tinieblas de satan s en ning n lugar de la tierra

475249 sin dios y sin jesucristo en nuestras almas infinitas desdichadamente
475250 porque la luz del se or jesucristo no ha nacido a n en nosotros
475251 para que el esp ritu de la luz del se or jesucristo sea parte y de gran amplitud de nuestras vidas de cada d a desde hoy mismo y para siempre en la eternidad venidera
475252 exclusivamente para los que creen en el nombre bendito del se or jesucristo en sus corazones eternos
475253 para que todo sea luz en nosotros tambi n en la eternidad venidera
475254 para que toda tiniebla salga de nuestras vidas y s lo su luz bendita brille en cada d a de nuestras vidas por la tierra y en la eternidad eternamente y para siempre
475255 por no amar a nuestro padre celestial por medio de su jesucristo
475256 pero los que reciben a jesucristo est n libres en la luz amparadora
475257 ya no camina en las tinieblas del esp ritu de satan s
475258 el esp ritu de la luz divina de su rbol de la vida su fruto de salud y de la felicidad infinita para su coraz n sant simo y para los corazones de los ngeles y as tambi n para la humanidad entera y m s no las tinieblas de satan s
475259 nuestro padre celestial a ora nuestra salvaci n cada d a
475260 realmente podemos escapar las tinieblas de satan s en un segundo y para siempre en nuestras vidas
475261 como dificultades problemas insolubles enfermedades de todas clases y hasta la misma muerte de nuestros corazones y de nuestros esp ritus humanos
475262 para que nos ayude en todo y a cada hora del d a de nuestras vidas por la tierra y as nos valla muy bien para siempre
475263 as como es glorificado jesucristo en el cielo por los ngeles
475264 pero ahora es de la luz de la nueva vida del cielo
475265 para vivir la imagen y de acuerdo a la semejanza santa y perfecta
475266 gracias a la sangre inmolada de nuestro se or jesucristo sobre el altar del se or
475267 para que ya no brillemos en nuestra luz humana y divina a la vez delante de nuestro padre celestial
475268 para ser infinitamente felices en su hijo nuestro se or jesucristo
475269 para que sean testigos fieles de su obra sant sima la felicidad intima de su coraz n sant simo
475270 para conocer la nica luz de la vida eterna del reino de los cielos del para so de la tierra y de la nueva jerusal n santa y perfecta del cielo
475271 para que cada una de las tinieblas de satan s salga de nuestras vidas y de los nuestros por ejemplo
475272 para vivir una vida sana y repleta de maravillas siempre
475273 para jam s volver a la vida eterna del para so
475274 la gloria infinita de cada uno de sus milagros maravillas y prodigios del cielo y de la tierra para honrar su nombre muy santo infinitamente en los corazones de muchos

475277 para vivir de los frutos de cada d a de su rbol de la vida
475278 en donde seremos la felicidad completa del coraz n sant simo de nuestro creador
475279 para que creas a la mentira a la enfermedad y a los problemas insolubles en tu coraz n
475280 nuestro padre celestial es nuestro rey infinitamente con toda seguridad
475281 morimos ahogados por las tinieblas de satan s y de sus ngeles ca dos
475282 caminemos cada d a por el camino de la luz de la vida eterna
475283 lleno de vida salud gozo paz felicidad gloria milagros maravillas prodigios y muchas cosas buenas del mismo coraz n de nuestro padre celestial de su hijo y de su esp ritu santo por ejemplo
475284 de cada hombre mujer ni o y ni a de las familias de las naciones de toda la tierra sin duda alguna
475285 para que jam s caminen por el camino de la luz sino de las tinieblas de la perdici n eterna
475286 el esp ritu de error y de mentira de la boca de la serpiente antigua para cumplir la voluntad de satan s
475287 para que jam s crezcamos hacia la gloria de dios
475288 somos la luz de muchos ciegos para que vean las verdades y las bendiciones del cielo
475289 para que crezcamos en la imagen y de acuerdo a la semejanza perfecta de nuestro creador
475290 ustedes son la luz del mundo y tienen fe eterna ustedes son los hijos e hijas de dios no dejen que nadie los enga jam s
475291 mucho m s gloriosos que satan s y sus secuaces

475293 para nuestros corazones y para nuestras nuevas vidas de cada d a en la tierra y en el cielo para siempre
475294 para solo ver y o r maldades de mentiras y calumnias crueles
475295 para que jam s seamos llenos de los poderes sobrenaturales de su esp ritu santo
475296 para que la imagen y semejanza sant sima de nuestro padre celestial sea desfigurada en el fuego destructor de la mentira
475297 y m s no de la imagen y semejanza sant sima de nuestro padre celestial
475298 para convertir al mundo entero en un mundo infernal para satan s y para sus ngeles ca dos
475299 moriremos perdidos en nuestros d as oscurecidos por sus tinieblas m s terribles y de sus ngeles ca dos tambi n
475300 tal como satan s intento atacar y destruir a nuestro padre celestial en el cielo con sus mentiras de siempre
475301 porque nuestro dios fue mucho m s sabio que l y s lo con su verdad
475302 para hacer da o a la imagen y semejanza de nuestro creador y de su rbol de la vida eterna en cada uno de nosotros
475303 para salvaguardarnos del mal de las mentiras usuales de satan s
475304 y as lo conozcas personalmente sin que nadie te tenga que decir nada de l
475305 as como escribi la vida del rbol de la vida en el coraz n de ad n y eva por ejemplo en el para so
475306 ambos desobedecieron a nuestro padre celestial y a su jesucristo en sus corazones y en sus vidas celestes
475307 pues conozcan la vida y la salud eterna del cielo en su jesucristo eternamente y para siempre
475308 para que jam s sea nada tinieblas en nuestros corazones y en nuestras almas infinitas
475309 s lo nuestro se or jesucristo es la luz brillante de tu coraz n de tu alma y de tu vida

475380 decisiones pol ticas que han sido tomadas durante a os
475381 el costo de los combustibles est haciendo que este sea un tiempo dif cil para muchos de nuestros ciudadanos pero es importante recordar que estos precios altos no fueron inevitables
475382 abriendo nuevos recursos en el pa s podemos ayudar a derribar los costos energ ticos y eso ayudar a asegurarse de que nuestra econom a sigue siendo la m s fuerte la m s vibrante y m s esperanzadora en el mundo

475397 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
475398 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
475399 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
475400 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
475401 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
475402 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

475423 we wanted to break the format and do something different particularly after how powerful the climax was with the death of two major characters
475424 so were telling one big story in season 3 and putting the torchwood crew under a huge amount of pressure and just seeing how they cope with their numbers depleted
475425 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
475426 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed

475428 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much
475429 but there is a tiny part of me that kind of prefers she does stay dead

475486 forensic under fire are bad science and dueling experts corrupting criminal justice
475487 the inability of our 21st century judicial system to properly differentiate between valid research and junk science
475488 the csi effect has also caused jurors to expect crime lab results far beyond the capacity of forensic science
475489 have kept scientific crime detection from living up to its full potential
475490 the less the forensic scientist knows about the crime the better
475491 make the civil and criminal justice systems more scientific and more objective to make them more just
475492 we should be ashamed of ourselves for not doing this
475493 my belief based on my research is that forensic science has failed to live up to the promise

475570 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic said dr julie gerberding the cdcs director she said other countries may adopt the agencys methodology

475592 driving abroad shouldnt be treated as just a way of getting from a to b if you make each journey fun and interesting it becomes one of the most memorable parts of the holiday simple things like pointing out scenery looking for landmarks or playing classic car games can make the trip enjoyable and will keep bbs at bay

475594 customers appreciate the value of refacing especially these days the option of saving over fifty percent of a total remodel is huge
475595 we do have some advantages our 30 year history and our great people to begin with
475596 our customers are looking for a strong value and peace of mind they know we are always here if they need us
475597 most tell us were just about their only customer who is doing well
475598 ive been on paddling expeditions throughout canada to india tahiti peru ecuador and elsewhere but our journey down the la river was probably the most exotic and mind blowing of them all i tried three different craft in the la river whitewater kayak sit on top kayak and canoe and the simple canoe trumped them all
475599 we found that even at this driest time of year you can float a boat down the whole river we also saw that the river has all the requisite physical characteristics of a traditional navigable waterway suitable hydrology depth configuration and flow ample access points and paths evidence of public use etc and that the river has enormous potential for commercial activities birdwatching fishing painting etc this is especially true of the 7 mile stretch of class i rapids in the soft bottomed glendale narrows many people in riverside neighborhoods like atwater village expressed interest in boating tours via small watercraft
475600 unfortunately the rivers potential is limited by corps and county claims that the public doesnt have a right to its own river which runs contrary to california state law article 10 section 4 of its constitution its practically criminal to charge onerous fees to the public for something the public already has a fundamental right to access somebody should look into that
475601 the corps did waive film permit fees at the last minute but still says that boats mustnt touch water next year we hope we can include the corps and county as willing partners colonel magness in the river with a canoe now that would be a fantastic day for the entire la river community
475602 it was a real kick sure there were a few short portages around shopping carts and some rock ledges but there were also waterlines on the channel walls indicating that water is 6 12 inches higher during other times of the year obviously you wouldnt want to mess with this river when its raining or when there are thunderstorms in the foothills but by and large it was a pleasurable surreal urban odyssey full of human nature and other wildlife our permits were originally denied due to safety concerns but the biggest danger we encountered was slipping on algae exacerbated by all that hot concrete
475603 when we transitioned from concrete lined sections to natural ones at the beginning of the sepulveda basin the glendale narrows and the estuary at willow street in long beach there were brief stretches where plants and soil were working overtime to uptake the pollutants and everything would smell unbelievably rank but after 20 yards it would start to balance out nature would prevail and you could start to imagine yourself anywhere but here in l a its really a pretty extraordinary fun experience
475604 neither one of us wanted to be selling junk you see that all over the place
475605 in tannenbaum treasures we found a supplier who had hand blown glass christmas ornaments that were of beautiful quality as we were a new store and they were fairly new to shipping it made for a good partnership their ornaments are found in gift stores across the country and they have a fairly large retail following but we were the one of the first online suppliers
475606 we both collect ornaments and this was a product we liked that really appealed to us
475607 it fit into our interests because were from missouri the show me state we decided on the name show me christmas and have been in business ever since
475608 on the christmas blog we plan to try and talk about the care and handling of delicate hand blown ornaments
475609 well be talking about different christmas traditions such as the tradition of having a christmas pickle on your tree we have pickle ornaments for that as well as how these traditions came about from europe wed like to discuss different ways to decorate as well as theme ornaments we have themes like alice in wonderland peter pan the twelve days of christmas and the nutcracker if people want to do a theme tree

475617 the problem with modern medicine is that it is only pathology oriented and practitioners dont take the time to communicate with their patients

475634 if you are going to claim that something is safe and effective for human disease you need to have proof
475635 they said it was impossible to reverse heart disease they said you need to use drugs because you cant motivate people to change their ways over a long time

475654 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
475655 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
475656 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy
475657 that is not what i meant at all that is not it at all

475659 mbm married black male in search of a nsa no strings attached relationship
475660 women are on the job in record numbers occupying every position from secretary to ceo
475661 this reality puts men and women in direct contact with one another on a daily basis in the morning they board crowded buses and trains together and for eight long hours they work in cramped office spaces brushing up against one another by accident and by choice a cordial invitation to have a quick lunch passionately erupts into an indecent proposal to have a quickie for lunch
475662 to be faithful a man ultimately has to deprive himself of something that he knows will feel good
475663 deprivation in a society that says if it feels good do it is tough for most men
475664 a man needs to deal with the underlying reasons why he cheats
475665 because with one slip of the tongue his world could come tumbling down around him
475666 ive worked with couples who have deepened their marital bond because of infidelity
475667 the main thing is genuine remorse nothing justifies it but it clearly can be forgiven
475668 the old adage fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me definitely applies
475669 is not that some black couples have problems but that so many black couples still love and give
475670 youve got to have that respect for the other person there are going to be hard times and some disagreements in a marriage but when you have that respect then you are allowed to be who you are and your partner is allowed to be who he is and you can work through anything
475671 but if sex is all you have holding your relationship together youre in trouble because you dont have a true relationship
475672 any relationship of substance has to be based on trust and commitment and respect
475673 if you have those things youll not only have a true partnership youll have great sex
475674 many people believe that couples must have dramatic occurrences cursing at one another being put out of the house keying somebodys car in order to appreciate one another
475675 wrong it is very possible in fact its the norm for a couple to have a nice respectful relationship without all of the drama that society is starting to make us believe is normal
475676 make sure that what youre fighting about is really what youre mad about at the time
475677 when arguments blow up into huge dramatic fights theres more at work there than what people say theyre arguing about thats why constant communication is important
475678 a lot of black men dont know how to be a husband or father
475679 but if you work with him nurture him talk to him you can help him to be the husband and father you want and need him to be
475680 a lot of times as black men our huge egos are all we bring to the table in a relationship and when that ego gets hurt we strike out with the one weapon we think we have
475681 but a lot of black men with the help of their women are learning to open up theyre learning how to deal with frustrations in their relationships in other ways besides having a woman on the side
475682 a lot of women withhold sex as a form of behavior modification or punishment when theyre angry with their spouse or boyfriend
475683 thats not only not healthy it doesnt work its the surefire way to send a man looking elsewhere especially since society is conditioning him to believe thats what is expected of him
475684 especially for the working mother who on top of her job still takes the lead role in caring for the kids and home shes often just too tired for sex but youve got to find ways to make that a priority in your relationship help him see how sharing in the housework and taking care of the children will also help in the bedroom dont withhold sex if he doesnt do those things but help him to see how rewarding it can be when he does
475685 most men will say i want a woman whos got it going on but after the relationship has begun those same men will now want that woman to submit and be a part of his vision and his dream he will want to be the dominant figure in the relationship in order to feel whole
475686 but sometimes you go along with what he wants to do even if its not exactly what you want and he goes along with what you want to do even if its not exactly what he wants
475687 you have to be secure in the feeling that your mate is operating in your best interest
475688 but a lot of black women have had experiences that may lead them to believe that every guy is trying to get over on them and thats a hard barrier to get over so men have to work hard to show them that theyre deserving of that trust it may take time and a lot of effort on the mans part to get through that barrier but a lot of couples manage it
475689 just because he doesnt feed the baby exactly the way you would or make dinner exactly the way you would you dont just take that away from him or degrade his approach
475690 if you nurture him and show appreciation for the way he does things youre showing him respect and building up that trust in the relationship
475691 it takes a commitment to what youre trying to build together
475692 but if you have the respect and th e love the commitment is a lot easier to maintain
475693 he isnt cheating because he doesnt have a good partner its because something inside him is creating a desire to go outside his relationship
475694 often hes struggling with issues that are making him unstable
475695 i wasnt at home a lot i was very short tempered with my ex spouse and i think i overcompensated for my actions by trying to do more and more good in less and less time
475696 so if you receive flowers and more attention but the little things dont check out or if there are expenses that are not accounted for you need to look out if a woman is smart she will be all over this guy and make him come clean
475697 ive discovered that people were getting hooked on the internet the way people are addicted to drugs or alcohol
475698 there are many stories of internet infidelity that ive come across and every couples definition of cheating is different some people believe that chatting on the internet isnt cheating until they are at the point when they cross that boundary and they are going to meet the person
475699 a major sign that the online relationship is getting out of control is when the spouse is spending so much time around the computer that he doesnt go out with the spouse any more
475700 but you should have seen the look on his face when i pointed out his set of black footprints returning to the bedroom
475701 they were in his cubicle plotting how they were going to get away from us their respective mates for the weekend
475702 i was hurt as hell i didnt mention a word about it until he came home from work that evening and sure enough he told me this long sob story about how his grandmother being ill and he wanted to spend the weekend with her like he used to do as a little boy i said nothing he went away for the weekend and when he returned on sunday night his possessions were waiting for him on the front porch
475703 the natural reaction of someone whos been cheated on is to vacillate between wanting to stay with their partner and needing to leave
475704 once youve made a decision you have to let your partner work to regain your trust despite your natural reservations you have to take a leap of faith and believe in your spouses ability to be faithful
475705 two people who are truly in love with each other can make an effort and right all wrongs by being honest and direct
475706 is not that some black couples have problems but that so many black couples still love and give
475707 youve got to have that respect for the other person there are going to be hard times and some disagreements in a marriage but when you have that respect then you are allowed to be who you are and your partner is allowed to be who he is and you can work through anything
475708 but if sex is all you have holding your relationship together youre in trouble because you dont have a true relationship
475709 any relationship of substance has to be based on trust and commitment and respect
475710 if you have those things youll not only have a true partnership youll have great sex
475711 many people believe that couples must have dramatic occurrences cursing at one another being put out of the house keying somebodys car in order to appreciate one another
475712 wrong it is very possible in fact its the norm for a couple to have a nice respectful relationship without all of the drama that society is starting to make us believe is normal

475730 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
475731 abortion is never safe because it always results in the death of a child one can hardly call abortion rare when there are more than a million performed every year in the united states and more than 45 million performed since abortions legalization in 1973
475732 it is never permissible for a catholic to support the legalization of the killing of innocent lives by abortion much less to lead the fight for legal abortion
475733 reviewing the record of gov sebelius when she served in the kansas house of representatives it is difficult to find a single instance either in a procedural or substantive vote where she acted in a manner that would afford unborn children the maximum protection in the 1980s and 1990s then representative sebelius voted to weaken or eliminate even such modest measures as parental notification waiting periods and informed consent

475736 you cant run a government and you cant run a company or anything like that unless everybody is on side

475840 our intelligence and counterterrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities
475841 neither of those individuals was ever part of cias high value terrorist interrogation program

475895 for all those whose hands are bloody with the cruel atrocities committed during the last war in bosnia
475896 the gospel teaches us to call acts and person who commit them by their names
475897 there is reason to doubt the lawfulness of many abortions authorised by certifying consultants indeed the committee itself has stated that the law is being used more liberally than parliament intended
475898 in my opinion the statistics and the committees comments over the years since the court of appeal made that observation do give rise to powerful misgivings about the lawfulness of many abortions
475899 fundamentally in line with the communion ecclesiology of the second vatican council
475900 the ordination of women to the episcopate effectively and definitively blocks a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church
475901 perhaps in our own day it would be possible too to think of a new oxford movement a retrieval of riches which lay within your own household this would be a re reception a fresh recourse to the apostolic tradition in a new situation it would not mean a renouncing of your deep attentiveness to human challenges and struggles your desire for human dignity and justice your concern with the active role of all women and men in the church rather it would bring these concerns and the questions that arise from them more directly within the framework shaped by the gospel and ancient common tradition in which our dialogue is grounded
475902 those who violate biblical teaching must show repentance and regret before we can share communion with them
475903 they say that they are not authorising blessings of same sex unions yet we read newspaper reports of them two american bishops have even presided at such services of blessings bishops have written diocesan policies on the blessings of same sex unions it is simply untrue to say they have not been authorised
475904 that such blessings continue and seem to be increasing hardly demonstrates regret let alone repentance on the part of the american church so when the archbishop of canterbury invited these american bishops to participate in the lambeth conference against the recommendations of the windsor report and the primates meeting and in the face of the unrelenting commitment of the american church to bless sinful behaviour we were stunned further betrayal
475905 i dont recognize him as a bishop me personally the whole thing was done out of order so we dont recognize that according to the basis of scripture supreme authority belongs to the church so were not travelling together
475906 i think hes coming from such a different starting place than most people here but im not where he is i cant just access scripture in a blank page way without the influences that surround it
475907 they are divided other people think it is a problem but for a majority we see it as a problem
475908 the mind of the communion on pressing issues of the day
475909 let me tell you why you are here youre here to be salt seasoning that brings out the god flavors of this earth if you lose your saltiness how will people taste godliness youve lost your usefulness and will end up in the garbage heres another way to put it youre here to be light bringing out the god colors in the world god is not a secret to be kept were going public with this as public as a city on a hill
475910 if they did i think we should stand strong and indicate that is something that crosses a threshold crosses a red line for the united states of america
475911 will be forced to react not with diplomatic but with military technical methods
475912 possibly including india and china that would deal with problems such as terrorism and crime from vladivostok on russias eastern border to vancouver
475913 makes it significantly more likely that one of the many islamist terror plots will succeed
475914 could help fend off any preemptive strikes against its nuclear facilities
475915 unfortunately mr blair has had to postpone his visit to gaza due to a specific security threat which would have made it impossible to proceed
475916 that there was a threat that could materialise as he entered the gaza strip
475917 the story of security threats was only an israeli invention to prevent the visit
475918 the shin bet investigation had focused on taher who had turned toward radical islam in recent years the shin bet concluded that he had contacted al qaida through the internet and agreed to participate in terrorist activities inside israel offering details on the location of israel defense forces camps strategic installations and crowded public places that could be targeted
475919 were old and had been deactivated and there was no actual security breach
475920 our political establishment is doing what it now habitually does namely ensuring that the political and corporate elite who break our laws on purpose are immune from consequences
475921 the canadians have begun preparations for the 2010 winter olympics the trade delegation has been in contact with the person responsible for security arrangements in the organizing committee of the 2010 winter olympics with the help of the export institute a presentation will be prepared which will include details of israeli companies capable of supplying products or services for olympic security
475922 with the power out for more than 24 hours most alarm systems batteries would be run dry that gives csis the perfect opportunity to set up their next terrorist attack against non conservative leaning canadians
475923 in patients with serious respiratory illness without an identified etiology clinicians should think about viruses
475924 when we called other hospitals in the portland area we almost fell out of our chairs because they all had seen recent severe and fatal cases of adenovirus
475925 a so called boot camp flu sickened hundreds at lackland air force base in san antonio the most serious cases were blamed on the emerging virus and one 19 year old trainee died
475926 political leaders seem intent on suppressing and ignoring the strong evidence that biofuels are a major factor in recent food price rises
475927 it is imperative that we have the full picture while politicians concentrate on keeping industry lobbies happy people in poor countries cannot afford enough to eat
475928 we got quite a few reports it started with a gentlemen in the lake arrowhead reporting a fireball in the meadow bay area and then we started getting calls from all over
475929 fire crews in barstow and on i 15 near stateline came up on the radio and reported an object in the sky moving very fast across the northern sky and described it as yellowish green in color with streaks of debris it looked like it burned up before it hit the ground
475930 what is so surprising is that rapid almost sudden changes take place in the earths magnetic field
475931 should never in any way be confused with a real contract
475932 it is nothing more than the standard document presented to all at will employees

475964 we are seeking to act in such a way that will hold the two together that we will not seek to act in a way that would destroy the anglican communion or the unity that is a gift to us from god
475965 commitment to hanging together as a communion and working through things together
475966 i think that some of the responsibilities and obligations that attach to being in communion have not been well respected in recent years and weve encountered difficulties as a result of that
475967 so the covenant is seen i think positively and hopefully as a vehicle for redressing some of those mistakes going forward initial signs are positive
475968 i believe we will always leave the door open for persons to enter who dont feel they can enter at the particular time
475969 entering the covenant is a self limitation in order to remain in communion the whole idea of the covenant is that people by consent enter into it
475970 it is not a stick to whack people over the head with so if people enter into it voluntarily the expectation is they will observe it
475971 im an optimist by nature i believe firmly that the anglican communion is going to continue by gods grace
475972 a unique perspective on what the athletes are experiencing in the air

475987 in deciding to settle two things mattered first the way child and family services looked at parents with disabilities that had to change what we went through should never happen again to anyone the training evaluation and monitoring are good steps and i trust and hope that dphhs can and will make progress finally the fact that most of the money will be available for gage when he is a young man that was critical to me its made something positive come out of a time that was very hard for us
475988 wow you are lazy you know you did more work trying to get it up that way then you would have used if just bent it over

476025 no one really wished to hear what i called myself
476026 and how do we keep our balance that i can tell you in one word
476027 im sorry sir youre going to have to leave your deoderant here unless you have a ziplock back to put it in
476028 john what are some good things to know about when taking a road trip with you
476029 we had a meeting last monday with gareth and his agent at which we all agreed we would have a 5pm deadline on wednesday and if liverpool had not proved they had the wherewithal to proceed with the transfer deal then we would all leave that aside and go on with it
476030 i was hoping that would be the case and this was not a matter of liverpool missing the deadline by 15 minutes as seems to have been reported
476031 liverpool first showed their interest in signing gareth barry almost four months ago so this is not a case of missing a deadline by 15 minutes thats simply not true
476032 the following morning we were very upbeat on the strength of what had happened on wednesday evening
476033 we were very buoyant and optimistic that everything could come back to normal again
476034 that wasnt to be though on thursday there was a meeting between gareths agent myself and the player
476035 they still felt that even though the deadline had passed they still felt liverpool were going to come in and do the deal
476036 obviously i was disappointed to hear that gareths head is a bit all over the place at the moment and they asked for some more time
476037 so ive listened to what theyve said and ill go with it reluctantly but ill go with it
476038 there will be no deadline and liverpool have all the time in the world now to sign gareth barry theyve got up to the normal window which is the 31st of this month
476039 so its really up to them gareth and his agent to sort it out ive decided this is the only way forward for us really
476040 i have a football club to run and i really do want people who want to play for us
476041 if liverpool at the end of it all do not come up with the money thats no one elses fault but their own
476042 id be delighted if that was the case and gareth stayed but i would doubt that very much the ball is very much in their court
476043 but i think he cant improve enough in the liverpool reserve team
476044 he should play in the first division week by week
476045 of course its not a problem if he plays in the reserve team for one or two years but doing it for a longer period is just not good for his development
476046 i dont think that at liverpool he has a real chance to play besides torres keane voronin or kuyt
476047 if he could get into the senior team then it would be a fantastic success but i think its more likely that hed be loaned to another team or its worse he may stay with the reserves
476048 bend over take it like a man and then ask for more
476049 no matter what the circumstances of your birth you were meant to be here at this particular place and time

476066 we believe in a jewish majority in jerusalem as such it is the capital of the jewish nation
476067 the israelis tried to take jerusalem out of the political game by using all their power to change the situation and consolidate their rule over the city but they failed

476072 only method of teaching men the true religion was established by divine providence for the whole world
476073 religions main focus is transforming bad people into good people yet the word of god says that good people are such by the transformation and the renewing of ones mind and that by the word of god so in essence the individual that does not have the power of the living word present in their life is nothing more that a good person

476094 i will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
476095 to put forth another nuanced position my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring gas prices down if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
476096 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
476097 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term

476133 my brother and i get into an argument with a taxi driver about getting our change back he got on his mobile phone and all of a sudden at least 15 greeks with baseball bats batons and chains appeared out of nowhere
476134 they demanded we hand over our wallets i think they look for any excuse to hook into tourists
476135 my brother was able to run and seek help and so only received minor cuts and bruising but in trying to reason with these thugs they punched kicked and belted me with their weapons for a 10 minute period
476136 i tried to run but it was very late at night and we were in a secluded part of the island with no one else around to help i was bashed so severely that my eye socket was smashed to pieces requiring major surgery when i returned to london where i am currently living
476137 my whole eye orbit had to be reconfigured with three metal plates and 12 screws the experienced surgeon who operated on my eye told me that i was lucky to be alive and just as lucky to still have my eye
476138 if you read the journal op ed pages every day
476139 for sure it hasnt been easy for us but today the car wasnt really bad i went off and i couldnt stay on the circuit so that doesnt help i lost time and that is really it
476140 that is life and we try to do better next time for sure one day we will get it back and hopefully it is not too late
476141 yeah i know that is the usual problem usually the car works better for me in the race and the main problem is to get the one lap out even on used tyres the car feels very nice so in the race the car should be fine
476142 the problem here is to get past and it isnt easy to overtake if the guy in front doesnt make any mistakes there is no way to get around him that is the only issue but we will see what we can do
476143 i went off on the last lap and i dont know how much i lost but it certainly didnt help

476177 i was very afraid to leave their family because i was happy i had a family and i kept holding on to them all the time trying not to lose them

476185 hillary clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states and realizes there are passionate feelings that remain among many of her supporters while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with senator clinton and her staff the dnc and senator obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
476186 that is a question that i think is a very obvious one to ask i mean what will happen at the convention with respect to my putting my name in nomination a roll call vote no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
476187 i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
476188 because i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go its as old as greek drama there is a catharsis everybody comes they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good

476191 whatever its validity when red lion affirmed it in 1969 or in 1987 when the commission rejected it without reservation today the scarcity rationale is totally surely and finally defunct
476192 the antiquated notion of spectrum scarcity can no longer serve as a basis for according only relaxed scrutiny to content restrictions in the broadcast media
476193 nor can the outmoded premises of pacifica that over the air broadcasting is uniquely pervasive or uniquely accessible to children as with any other content based restriction of speech the government should be made to demonstrate that the remand order serves a compelling state interest and is the least restrictive means available to achieve that interest it cannot do either

476198 most voters wont see the parallels between a presidential candidate and two party girls so a legitimate point about inexperience gets lost in the appearance of name calling

476248 dividend superstar 2 15 7 yield from a secretive investment company thats paid dividends for 43 quarters straight
476249 you can buy this companys shares and it pays very juicy steady dividends it currently has about 220 businesses in its portfolio that gives it tremendous diversification across sectors and industries
476250 whats more because of the way this company is structured it must keep its debt under control making it one of the least leveraged publicly traded financial companies in the u s and
476251 it must pay out 90 of its profits to shareholders in the form of dividends
476252 dividend superstar 3 15 4 yield from fleet of profit gushing oil tankers that generate up to 4 4 million each day
476253 oil companies are geysers of cash no secret there but an even steadier business is the massive container ships that transport the oil these companies churn out fat profits whether oil prices are up or down
476254 if you own those ships you stand to rake in a constant stream of cash and thats especially true of my favorite dividend superstar in this sector
476255 take a guess how much it charges to use one of its ships in the first quarter of 2008 the average rate for one of its very large crude carriers vlccs was 82 400 and according to early numbers it was getting an average of 112 000 in the second quarter
476256 once you realize that the company boasts dozens of ships youll get a sense of just how much money it can make in a single day take the average day rate from early 2008 and multiply it by 54 thats 4 4 million in 24 hours
476257 in 2005 it handed investors dividends of 8 10 per share
476258 in 2006 it paid out dividends worth 7 55 a share
476259 and in 2007 it paid dividends of 8 25 per share
476260 looking ahead whether oil is up or down i certainly dont see less oil being shipped anytime soon and i should also note that this company is involved in transporting other hot commodities like coal and iron too if anything rising worldwide demand for natural resources argues for even bigger profits ahead for this shipper
476261 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
476262 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
476263 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
476264 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
476265 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
476266 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
476267 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
476268 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
476269 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
476270 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
476271 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
476272 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
476273 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
476274 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
476275 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
476276 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
476277 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
476278 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
476279 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
476280 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
476281 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
476282 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
476283 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
476284 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
476285 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
476286 who are open to doing something on the production side
476287 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
476288 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
476289 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
476290 in my heart i think a woman has two choices either shes a feminist or a masochist
476291 any involvement with research activism or advocacy related to pornography or sexual violence
476292 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
476293 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
476294 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
476295 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
476296 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
476297 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
476298 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
476299 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
476300 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
476301 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
476302 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
476303 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
476304 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
476305 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
476306 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
476307 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
476308 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
476309 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
476310 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
476311 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
476312 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
476313 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
476314 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
476315 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
476316 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
476317 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
476318 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
476319 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
476320 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
476321 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
476322 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
476323 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
476324 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
476325 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
476326 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
476327 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
476328 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
476329 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
476330 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
476331 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
476332 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
476333 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
476334 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
476335 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
476336 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
476337 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
476338 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
476339 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
476340 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
476341 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
476342 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
476343 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
476344 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
476345 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
476346 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
476347 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
476348 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
476349 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
476350 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
476351 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
476352 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
476353 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
476354 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we

476419 its a good thing we ran some race trims in practice yesterday which typically this year we havent been doing in practice we have been going straight to qualifying trim
476420 i think it was a good call to run some race runs the car was comfortable and i think it will race good obviously we didnt qualify good but i am confident that we are going to race well we always do
476421 i have never started a race that i have never been to before had no practice session or anything
476422 the biggest thing is we just raced here in june
476423 a lot of times you need to get a good camber reading and things like that to where you have those set for the race the long runs and stuff so you dont wear your tires out one way or another
476424 you know how it is going to react there are no unknowns there wasnt a whole lot of practice in race trim
476425 we got a little bit of race runs it isnt like we havent been to pocono in two or three years we were just here eight weeks ago so everybody kind of knows what to expect as far as the track goes this track does swing a lot weather related
476426 he showed me a lack of respect that ive given him in the past
476427 im not here to wreck him thats not my intention you say things in the heat of the battle right after because its an emotional sport i wish i could have taken some of those things back but i said them
476428 i respect him as a race car driver hes very fast hes not on my christmas card list anymore and he probably never will be if were around each other on the track im going to race him probably harder than ive raced anybody but im not here to be a dirty driver and do what he did to me its not my way
476429 were both driving fords so we see each other from time to time
476430 hes not overly friendly to me so its his choice to make the next move i tried to clear the air after mexico i dont know owe him anything i dont owe him more an apology more than ive already done add comment
476431 i just had a meeting its not a question of how to drive the track its the different rules in nascar they are different than open wheel racing on a road course so there is stuff i needed to know
476432 it wont have any affect on the teams because this is a road course what matters to teams are the ovals
476433 it is a harder job than i expected i much prefer driving

476459 doesnt look like all the other presidents on dollar bills
476460 because they seem to have potential to explain the lateral apparent motion as well as at least some perhaps a majority of the other significant features these are
476461 one morning in comes this kid sneakers and bluejeans and hair disheveled and im thinking this kid doesnt belong here what is he doing

476468 microsofts biggest challenge is to get would be customers to set aside whatever preconceptions they have and listen to its pitch for vista aligning its most vocal vista critics with the flat earth society is a clever way to get peoples attention
476469 ads responding directly to those ads is a losing tactic largely thanks to john hodgman the humor bar is set extraordinarily high any kind of response ad would legitimize the claims in those apple ads and run the significant risk of being seen as lame and uncool source
476470 i was making some changes this week in control panel and my machine and could hardly believe my eyes when i saw that new entry at the bottom apples mobileme
476471 wir wussten dass es nicht leicht wird ronaldo zu bekommen der verein arbeitet aber sehr hart um zu einer l sung zu kommen
476472 yet another volley of dehumanizing spiritual violence directed at glbt persons and their families
476473 the archdiocese is now dictating to people who they can and cannot pray for
476474 has been the chief cause of misery since the world began
476475 i figured id come over and straighten out we have no intention of participating in todays hearing its a total waste of time we have sufficent laws on the books that we enforce to deal with this issue
476476 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
476477 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest of it we can deal with
476478 so as far as all this grandstanding and foolishness waste of city time on this issue and the fact that i felt aggravated enough about it to interrupt my workout to come over and set the record straight lapd has no intention of participating in this farce
476479 if something happened to one of us shed always be taken care of
476480 ohioans are suffering as a result of the downturned national economy
476481 the governor believes this is further evidence of the need for new leadership committed to moving the national economy forward and providing americans with real relief
476482 it really blows away the myth that somehow theres some kind of economic advantage because we can get cheap poison toys and cheap poison drugs and cheap second rate tires from a china relationship
476483 all the tools provided by the governor and the legislature
476484 design a new energy plan that will allow us to continue providing reliable affordable and cleaner electricity in ohio while at the same time allowing us to devise a critical economic development plan that will help turnaround ohio
476485 it costs a lot more to be poor than it used to
476486 the most encouraging thing is she has been listened to
476487 i think theres a recognition she has a lot of supporters out there and they need to reach out as shes reaching out to him obama
476488 weve worked together and there are a number of clinton supporters on the platform committee itself
476489 state also claims for itself the ability to declare what constitutes marriage it transforms marriage from a pre political obligation into its own creation
476490 an institution that needs to be coddled its very fragility demands a culture in which it is protected
476491 once marriage becomes a statist institution for the sake of consenting adults the state will increasingly be called upon to create the social conditions to protect these unions
476492 the reality of sex differences between men and women leading to the potential for offspring is essential to the pre political foundation of marriage
476493 is precisely what advocates of same sex marriage seek to change
476494 marriage rooted in procreation and sexual differences is to be replaced by marriage for the gratification of two consenting adults
476495 doing milk was an incredible experience and i talked about how my own private idaho had such an effect on me and also drugstore cowboy gus van sant had been a hero of mine since i was a teenager and sean penn as well and so it was a chance to work with two of my heroes i will be asked what it was like to kiss sean penn about a million times and the few times i run into paparazzi thats their new annoying thing it was uncomfortable especially like the first time we did it we didnt do it many times but the first kiss of the film he had on he grew a beard but he needed a slightly thicker beard so he had some hairs intertwined in his real hairs and so we kissed and those kept getting in my mouth and it was just kind of uncomfortable and not that fun jokes when i saw spicoli i just wanted to make out with him
476496 barry george is an innocent man he spent eight years in prison for a crime he did not commit those years would have been better spent looking for the real killer
476497 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
476498 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
476499 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
476500 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
476501 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
476502 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
476503 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
476504 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
476505 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
476506 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor

476509 we remain focused on two items successfully refinancing our debt to provide us with additional liquidity and financial flexibility and achieving operational improvements for improved financial results in the second half of the year
476510 in addition to new business we expect a seasonal pick up in demand in most of our key markets we continue to expect second half operating results to improve over the first half but improvement for the full year will be more challenging given rising costs
476511 the back alley is a dangerous and degrading place to get medical care it used to be the vw bus and dr kevorkian now its the vet pharmacy
476512 a political party cannot be all things to all people
476513 we will not surrender not in iraq or afghanistan or anywhere else in the world
476514 look at all these m th rf ck n mexicans why you let em in here huh it wasnt us n gg s who let them in
476515 our main reason for doing this is were trying to cut down on the black population
476516 she holds the trendy idea that religions are essentially the same
476517 she irrationally romanticizes the notion that god can be whatever you want him her it to be
476518 she has an incredible amount of influence over people and an incredible following
476519 she irrationally romanticizes the notion that god can be whatever you want him her it to be
476520 jesus can not come back until that gospel is preached in the four corners of this earth
476521 they must understand that sacrifices are inevitable they must understand the whos the whys the whens the whats the wheres and whos standing with you not whos standing behind you because sometimes people standing behind you disappear when you look back
476522 it did not belong in the olympics i do not feel that was the place to make a stand every time something has come up since then the munich massacre of the 1972 olympics and the boycott of the 1980 olympics i think that has something to do with it the olympics should mean pure sport
476523 smith did what he thought was best for the sport forty years later were coming to see who tommie smith is and his great contribution to the world i have a high regard for who he is and what hes tried to do for the sport
476524 there was so much racial unrest that was going on in our country at that time martin luther king had been assassinated robert f kennedy had been assassinated it seemed like the hopes for the future were dark this was something that was brought to our attention and they started a process and then good things started to happen it took a lot of courage they were ridiculed and ostracized its only now theyre getting their just due
476525 maybe it wasnt the best way to make a statement but i support them what it caused was for people to look at what was going on forty years later its much better
476526 i truly believed they had a voice and they used it but their livelihood should have been much greater they felt as if they had no other means i applaud them and im happy that they did what they did
476527 more than 500 malt and hop shops prospered in new york city another 100 000 stores sold malt syrup nationwide including atlantic and pacific a amp p kroger and piggly wiggly grocery stores prior to prohibition only 500 to 600 shops sold malt syrup nationwide by 1928 25 000 shops including woolworths were selling homebrewing equipment such as bottle cappers and tubing
476528 by 1929 the prohibition bureau using sales figures for hops malt and other ingredients estimated that americans brewed 700 million gallons of beer at home
476529 god only knows what goes on in little podunk towns across america right along with certain precincts in big cities
476530 my take obamas credentials to be president are so tissue thin that a relatively small dip in the polls has created a big enough crisis for him to panic and delay his vp pick im giving credit to the mccain campaign that has really slammed obama hard for being a celebrity and sent him reeling
476531 too soon the pubbie convention is after the dem convention so just wait and see what obama does because he by convention realities he has to pick first
476532 i think mccain should announce his vp monday or tuesday continue to take the wind out of obamas sails
476533 on the day of judgment i shall walk out of this tomb and see before me a great city
476534 you write best when you write about what you know
476535 grave findings have shown that late palaeolithic settlers in central europe and their mesolithic descendants in the scandinavian peninsula were europoids who had compartively large teeth a seemingly comical detail but nevertheless an important factor in identifying these populations although it is very unlikely that the language of these settlers will ever be identified i cannot see any grounds for the theory that either of these groups spoke proto uralic
476536 east europeans have small teeth compared with the relatively large teeth of the scandinavian
476537 if elected obama would want mccain to play role of loyal opposition
476538 ill extend my hand in the spirit of cooperation and unity
476539 i expect mr mccain to occasionally be seen when i wish to allow it and not to be heard
476540 a member of the hamas police and a member of the ezzedine al qassam brigades the military wing of hamas were martyred
476541 fired mortar rounds at the hamas police as well as a rocket at gaza city
476542 there have been several arrests and there will be many more we have asked the police to be firm
476543 all soviet bloc espionage services were identically organized and had an identical modus operandi
476544 soviet espionage operations can easily be identified by their particular patterns of you are familiar with them
476545 that was his problem the soviet union would have no choice but to accept his challenge
476546 we cannot and will not permit the communists to drive us out of berlin either gradually or by force
476547 contingency plans for using nuclear weapons against the soviet union
476548 the lunatic khrushchev is so furious at kennedy that hes ready to tear him limb from limb with his bare teeth
476549 today people remember khrushchev as a down to earth peasant who corrected the evils of stalin but he was not the khrushchev i knew was a compulsive political chatterbox who had no objective appreciation of facts and who had gotten a taste for the simple criminal solution because of his close association with stalins mass killings
476550 is mentioned over 75 times in holy scripture rsv and over 220 times as the
476551 hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel
476552 how awesome is this place this is none other than the house of god
476553 and solomon began to build the house of the lord in jerusalem in mount moria which had been shewn to david his father in the place which david had prepared in the thrashing floor of ornan the jebusite
476554 thus all the work that king solomon did on the
476555 and when the priests came out of the holy place a cloud filled the
476556 the lord has set the sun in the heavens but has said that he would dwell in thick darkness i have built thee
476557 unless the lord builds the house those who build it labor in vain
476558 great shall be the glory of this last house more than of the first saith the lord of hosts and in this place i will give peace saith the lord of hosts
476559 it shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the
476560 come let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob that he may teach us his ways and we may walk in his paths
476561 but you shall receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be witnesses for me in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and even to the very ends of the earth
476562 the new testament lies hidden in the old and the old testament is revealed in the new
476563 but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself
476564 for the time is that judgment should begin at the house of god and if at first at us what shall be the end of them that believe not the gospel of god
476565 if i were not a catholic and were looking for the true church in the world today i would look for the one church which did not get along well with the world in other words i would look for the church which the world hates my reason for doing this would be that if christ is in any one of the churches in the world today he must still be hated as he was when he was on earth in the flesh if you would find christ today then find the church that does not get along with the world look for the church which is hated by the world as christ was hated by the world look for the church which is accused of being behind the times as our lord was accused of being ignorant and of never having learned look for the church which men sneer at as socially inferior as they sneered at our lord because he came from nazareth look for the church which is accused of having a devil as our lord was accused of being possessed by beelzebub the prince of devils look for the church which in seasons of bigotry men say must be destroyed in the name of god as men crucified christ and thought they had done a service to god look for the church which the world rejects because it claims it is infallible as pilate rejected christ because he called himself the truth look for the church which is rejected by the world as our lord was rejected by men look for the church which amid the confusion of conflicting opinions its members love as they love christ and respect its voice as the very voice of its founder and the suspicion will grow that if the church is unpopular with the spirit of the world then it is unworldly and if it is unworldly it is other worldly since it is other worldly it is infinitely loved and infinitely hated as was christ himself but only that which is divine can be infinitely hated and infinitely loved therefore the church is divine
476566 obama was attempting to keep politics out of his trip the paper claimed
476567 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
476568 and if we can come up with a genuine bi partisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence then that is something i am open to
476569 im saying that i didnt say what you said i said because today im saying what i did say which is different from what you think i said because i didnt say that im saying i said something different than what i said because today is different and what i say now is different but its not different from what i said because i said something different but its not different its the same
476570 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
476571 and if we can come up with a genuine bi partisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence then that is something i am open to
476572 i know you believe you understand what you think i said but im not sure you realize thats not what i meant
476573 as i have consistently said i am flexibly determined to stay the course of reasonability and therefore i promise not to raise taxes
476574 you cannot have zero piracy and if you try to get to zero piracy you will make the experience of consuming music so painful youll have zero industry
476575 all these forms of drm are simply creating more technical hassles that i have to deal with as a legal customer meanwhile cracks and keygens and other ways to steal bioshock are all over the file sharing networks and are actually
476576 because of those vigorous denials from campaign staffers not one reporter posed the question to edwards that dbkp kept repeating do you deny that youve been in telephone contact with rielle hunter since she found out she was pregnant did the reporters on the edwards campaign bus perhaps assign a larger weight to the campaign staffs denials than their readers would have
476577 the main excuse is that the national enquirers reporting cant be trusted
476578 ive read that edwards was on obamas short list for vp
476579 god you show your almighty power above all in your mercy and forgiveness
476580 by the outpouring of the holy spirit as the church the communion of saints the forgiveness of sins the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting
476581 the church a communion living in the faith of the apostles which she transmits is the place where we know the holy spirit
476582 in the witness of saints through whom he manifests his holiness and continues the work of salvation
476583 the holy spirit whom christ the head pours out on his members builds animates and sanctifies the church she is the sacrament of the holy trinitys communion with men
476584 the church is the people that god gathers in the whole world she exists in local communities and is made real as a liturgical above all a eucharistic assembly she draws her life from the word and the body of christ and so herself becomes christs body
476585 the church is in history but at the same time she transcends it it is only with the eyes of faith that one can see her in her visible reality and at the same time in her spiritual reality as bearer of divine life
476586 baptism is the first and chief sacrament of the forgiveness of sins it unites us to christ who died and rose and gives us the holy spirit
476587 thus the creeds final amen repeats and confirms its first words i believe
476588 mr mac is responding well to treatment he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well hes doing great and hopes to get out soon hes bernie hes one of the best guys youll meet
476589 i wanted to go to law school because i thought that was the way to gain access to power
476590 it seemed so clearly wrong to me that your zip code has such a profound impact on your chances in life
476591 i thought heres my chance heres how i can do all the things i care about
476592 wed just walk up to people on the street in community centers in grocery stores
476593 wed say were starting a free college prep charter school for fifth graders do you know any fourth graders who might be interested
476594 ill draw a picture of a mountain with a flag with 2016 on the top
476595 ill tell them its the year theyre going to college ill say it will be a lot of hard work but well do it together
476596 they will know this is a different kind of school
476597 if you let little things slide you may have to worry about big things later
476598 we tell them that wasnt the assignment and there are consequences
476599 the most important thing is the end result of what happened on the victory stand
476600 its just a shame that we have to be in a public feud about who did what and why
476601 it was viewed immediately as two athletes defying the flag defying the pride of being who we are
476602 and for tommie smith that never was the case i was there because i had thought it was necessary to make a stand against what we were going through in my country
476603 was really a culmination of what was happening in our history as a nation in a lot of ways
476604 because they were giving voice to people who had no voice and they did that at their own peril
476605 its another thing he has because of being on that victory stand with me
476606 i didnt really feel that mr smith would do that thing on the podium had he not won that gold medal
476607 thats the main and sole reason why i had to go
476608 to do what i felt necessary to try to bring attention to people about not just black america but the plight of this world in which we live
476609 totally against the idea of a smith and carlos separation because of the need to be socially acknowledged
476610 we are people with difference of opinion of the same thing which comes to the same end which is social equity
476611 i cant believe this youre sitting here and saying this this is insulting john i like you too much for this stuff to happen
476612 its more like theyre brothers who have had a terrible fight
476613 all of us would much prefer they were friends and political comrades who had forged a bond of love out of the shared experience but in a weird way its almost deeper than that
476614 i think a lot of americans still dont understand that for a white guy to stand up for black america in 1968 wasnt the coolest thing to do
476615 they had every chance in the world to say that wasnt it true
476616 tommie and john keep getting all these humanitarian awards they get doctorates they get statues
476617 but what about the guy in the middle that came second hes the one thats missing out
476618 i love these guys to death and i consider them family
476619 but the fact that theyre actually now fighting i think they need to seriously take a look at their position in the world and their responsibility in the world
476620 realize they can make a serious contribution to making this a better world
476621 were probably at an all time high in terms of athlete activism
476622 i have a lot of pain and agony about it
476623 dylan was doing occupations at school recently and the teacher said you have to go home and ask mummy and daddy what they do so we were trying to explain to
476624 it was like an episode of 24 with the clock ticking
476625 the possibility that a small number of people might try to block a roadway or impede access to a bridge does not justify stripping 100 000 people of their first amendment rights
476626 larger western tradition of personal freedom consensual government and individualism
476627 i am not in the best shape i am not at my highest level so it will take time for me to get better
476628 since i was a young girl its been my dream to become no 1 in the world
476629 we encourage everyone to do the same thats called being an individual

476634 in other cities protesters are not just handcuffing themselves to each other
476635 they put their handcuffs inside pvc tubes which are inside concrete theyve figured out ways that keep the police from just using bolt cutters to cut them apart they also use buckets of urine and feces and various noxious substances to pour on themselves or the police
476636 angry drivers can be even more dangerous than police under these circumstances
476637 protesters have been chaining themselves together since i was a protester in the 60s

476645 the commission will remain vigilant in protecting consumers access to content on the internet
476646 our march is a march for america not black america or white america
476647 with seven straight months of job losses with the highest percentage of homes in foreclosure since the depression with family incomes down 1 000 and the costs of gas groceries and health care up a whole lot more than that so many people are looking at their children wondering if theyll be able to give them the same chances they had
476648 you know that you cant take that seat at the front of the bus if you cant afford the bus fare you cant live in an integrated neighborhood if you cant afford the house and it doesnt mean a whole lot to sit down at that lunch counter if you cant afford the lunch
476649 i stand here before you today feeling no small amount of gratitude because i know that my story and so many other improbable stories would not be possible without all that the urban league has done to put opportunity within reach of every american
476650 its because of the doors youve opened because of the battles youve fought and won because of the sacrifices of people in this room and all those who came before you that i come here today as a candidate for president of united states of america
476651 ill never forget how my journey began ill never forget that i got my start as a foot soldier in the movement the urban league built
476652 that work taught me a fundamental truth that has guided me to this day that change doesnt come from the top down it comes from the bottom up
476653 after the 11th i was hoping to get to 5 or 6 under and still have a chance
476654 today was a little better more regular golf i missed a few shots here and there but i kept going and when you hole a shot like that on the 11th it keeps the momentum going
476655 what was really special was coming down the last eight with that great support teeing up so early compared with leaders we still had a huge crowd and it was very special coming up 18 i hope it will be like that tomorrow
476656 im not going to play next year but i have been asked about being a captain and i said id be honored if asked
476657 its all part of our continuing look at tobacco and access to the population
476658 we dont believe stores promoting health care products such as pharmacies should be selling something that is harmful
476659 we realize it is a very addictive drug they are on
476660 we understand people dont want to smoke but they are addicted
476661 we also have a right to be in a smoke free area
476662 i never sold cigarettes at any of my jobs i dont think people should smoke
476663 its bad for your health and we are an integrative pharmacy and we are selling health so that is definitely something we would not be selling
476664 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
476665 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence than thats something im open to
476666 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
476667 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
476668 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
476669 anyone foolish enough to believe this dudes promises should be hit with a stick on the head
476670 but it is not clear how far obamas endorsement will get the senate compromise

476675 this is not about khrushchev or stalin its about the future of
476676 the reason these rumors persist is rooted in the fate of the country when reformers are considered to be weak and tyrants strong
476677 i dont think khrushchev is of any interest to todays russian government
476678 im convinced leonid was shot down and killed in the war and that he was neither a captive nor collaborator of the germans
476679 stalin asked him to stand up and get a hold of himself
476680 i have said everything in my book there is nothing to add
476681 nothing happens in russia without the support of the government

476697 i was very afraid to leave their family because i was happy i had a family and i kept holding on to them all the time trying not to lose them

476703 this is not about khrushchev or stalin its about the future of russia
476704 the reason these rumors persist is rooted in the fate of the country when reformers are considered to be weak and tyrants strong
476705 i dont think khrushchev is of any interest to todays russian government
476706 im convinced leonid was shot down and killed in the war and that he was neither a captive nor collaborator of the germans
476707 stalin asked him to stand up and get a hold of himself

476719 independent state of croatia is the foundation of todays homeland of croatia
476720 e very honorable croat is proud of the name of dinko sakic
476721 to the best of my knowledge no public official of any significant stature has spoken out against this outrageous display of unrepentant racism anti semitism and xenophobia
476722 under these circumstances what croatian society needs is a clear and unequivocal reminder that dinko sakic was a mass murderer and brought shame to the croatian people that one of democratic croatias greatest achievements was his prosecution and punishment and that only by totally repudiating the legacy of the ndh independent state of croatia 1941 1945 and its fanatic ustasha extremists will croatia become a welcome member of nato and the european union
476723 this is the happiest day of my life if each of you could feel one per cent of the joy i feel croats would be the happiest nation in the world
476724 please behave dont act like a mob dont let me be ashamed of you
476725 because of his past busic should spend the rest of his life privately out of any political or public context
476726 if all croats are happy as i am today wed be the happiest nation there are no words in any language in this world that could express my todays feelings my wishes and eternal gratitude to you all my brother croats and croattes that you came in such numbers your gathering proves legendary solidarity of croats with their fighters and with their sacrifices

476728 by obstructing these compromise proposals to investigate unsolved civil rights crimes and protect children without borrowing more money the senate leadership is denying justice to victims of the past present and future generations it is also sending a message that congress defiantly refuses to live within its means and will not even consider paying for new spending by cutting wasteful washington spending what we have seen this week is a cynical ploy from democratic leaders to use victims of crime diseases and other calamities as props in a partisan political campaign these tactics have embarrassed and discredited the senate and helped reinforce its nine percent approval rating
476729 the decision by senate democratic leaders to obstruct a compromise supported by alvin sykes the president of the emmett till justice campaign and senator dodd the sponsor of the bill is deplorable and indefensible the emmett till compromise would simply require senate democratic leaders to acknowledge that congress should live within its means like every american family the compromise would require the department of justice to prioritize existing funds in order to fund this effort this step was necessary because senate democratic leaders had no intention to fund this program this year even as they accused me of obstruction and harboring other base motives
476730 there is no reason for democratic leaders to insist that these bills pass only in the context of their so called tomnibus bill that was soundly rejected and viewed as an exercise in demagoguery and mindless partisanship democratic leaders can now explain why they have drawn a moral equivalence between victims of civil rights crimes and online predators on one side and botanical gardens and war of 1812 commemorations on the other side senators were elected to set priorities and no normal person would say these causes deserve equal attention

476754 as far as ive known him hed never got into a single fight in his whole life

476757 he was just such an amazing guy he had a great personality

476820 he got more out of the day than anybody i ever knew
476821 and some of those tactics you mention the war in iraq are like that we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement etc etc

476847 the sons of iraq and consent presence of iraqi and coalition forces has made the area much safer allowing people to travel to the markets to sell and purchase goods
476848 on any given day the market place is very busy with the added security the iraqi police have stepped up patrols which make the people feel safe and the local government representatives are starting to make their way to areas once not traveled
476849 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
476850 i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
476851 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
476852 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
476853 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
476854 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
476855 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
476856 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
476857 i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons
476858 im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i dont have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
476859 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
476860 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
476861 weve got to make sure we keep focused on peoples day to day concerns we dont take the skill of the republicans in engaging in negative campaigning lightly
476862 at some point people are going to have to make decisions are we going to keep arguing or are we going to get things done
476863 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good
476864 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to
476865 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
476866 the economy is certainly not going to be a positive for the republicans
476867 it is a decent margin but it is not a landslide
476868 it would have been much larger if there had been a recession in 2008
476869 this model has correctly predicted the winning party 12 out of 14 times
476870 the weak current state of the economy and the sharp rise in energy prices pose a significant headwind to the mccain campaign if voters weigh these factors similarly to how they have in the past
476871 average per capita real income growth probably will be only around 0 75 percent at election day moreover cumulative us military fatalities in iraq will reach 4 300 or more

476880 i just heard about your calls to blacklist conservative actors and think you are a

476888 the stories were sometimes difficult to listen to we found that all the prisoners we met played with our emotions
476889 the prisoners had portrayed their stories as such normal incidents that in my mind i started to see these crimes as lesser offences
476890 you dont want people normalising sanitising glamorising drug use murder and anti social behaviour
476891 its a really good wake up call for them a lesson they should be more careful and critical
476892 the kids are intrigued they hang on every word it teaches them some important lessons weve never had any problems at all

476920 we are going to follow the law provided and work to get these districts together
476921 the city said it needed at least a year to make districts
476922 theyre scooping people off the street and holding then without phone calls and without charges for hours
476923 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
476924 in this kind of year a change election with big issues at stake that sort of campaign is not gonna be in a voice the american people can understand
476925 and at some point john will need the goodwill that he spent years achieving
476926 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
476927 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
476928 and so im at peace with the britney and paris web ad or the campaigns charge that somehow i wouldnt go visit the troops unless i had reporters with me which every reporter who was on the trip knows is absolutely not true
476929 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks and planting doubts about people and what weve got to do is make sure that we are very clear to the american people about how my policies will make a difference in their lives
476930 i am absolutely confident that the people in union mo jacksonville fla or any other city or town across the country at the end the day are going to be making their decisions based on what they think is going to be best for their lives and their childrens lives
476931 i dont come out of central casting im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
476932 what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from
476933 what has been an approach of the mccain campaign is to say hes risky
476934 they are very good at negative campaigns they are not so good at governing
476935 we get four or five shots in a row assertions by mccain that i would rather lose a war so that i can win a campaign that i am not willing to visit the troops that i somehow am full of myself that im an empty headed celebrity whatever repeated attacks have been launched this week so when i say boy those are kind of silly arguments the press says isnt that being negative
476936 so that they may grow in their knowledge and understanding of jesus
476937 i left the church because i grew out of it
476938 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind jon
476939 they are telling me theyd been led to believe they didnt have any choice about who they can treat
476940 some managers are interpreting the rules too restrictively and are saying unless someone is at deaths door you shouldnt treat them unless they pay this is wrong
476941 three of my clients including a child have died after treatment was refused
476942 well never know whether they would have died anyway or not but they werent given the chance to survive
476943 there is nothing like the truth it hurts but its ok
476944 you need to get on tv and do 30 second spots to reach the people that dont listen to you
476945 the culture war is between the winners and those who think theyre losers who want to become winners the losers think the only way they can become winners is by banding together all the losers and then empowering a leader of the losers to make things right for them
476946 democrats shmira dont have reasons for people to vote for them theyre just trying to gin up anger and resentment for their opposition and its just not working anymore
476947 bigot a person who wins an argument with a liberal

476951 shomrim are all criminals they were indicted on assault charges and you shouldnt work with them anymore
476952 corruption and bribary in the 77th precinct and the district attorneys office
476953 what is really sad here is that we have a group of reckless individuals whos entire cause of existence is that of hatred and whos one goal is to attempt and destroy shomrim
476954 that these tactics are not new to us or to the police department last year they had their hand in a botched attempt to have 3 members locked up
476955 officer brian duffy who was the detective investigating the case
476956 some men arent looking for anything logical they cant be bought bullied reasoned or negotiated with some men just want to watch the world burn
476957 i may not keep kosher but at least i dont eat pig
476958 i dont have split hooves so im just not kosher
476959 look i have split hooves just like a kosher animal should
476960 your latest post is nothing but a ridiculous rant about pigs have you lost it
476961 i am not involved in shmira i dont even live in new york
476962 i have been frequenting your site to see if there was any truth to your claims
476963 i received an email that so amp so from shomrim massered on yitzchak shochat
476964 what does so and so have anything to do with the incident involving yitzchak shochet
476965 not a bullshit email that made him say ohhh i didnt know
476966 after all its easy for huebener to walk in the 71 and masser its easy for hertlze
476967 i have one question for w i s or anyone if a shmira member needed help with anything would you help him
476968 dont even have a rudimentary second grade understanding of things

476972 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
476973 we read deeply for varied reasons most of them familiar that we cannot know enough people profoundly enough that we need to know ourselves better that we require knowledge not just of self and others but of the way things are

476977 to bring further attention upon the important issue of illegal immigration i am very excited about working more closely with state legislators for legal immigration the black market economy that relies upon illegal immigrant labor penalizes legal immigrants exploits illegal aliens unfairly taxes residents and places at a disadvantage legal workers and union laborers other effects include heightened local crime as evidenced by increased gang activity in our community and the series of recent rapes murders and home invasions by illegal aliens
476978 promised during his 2006 campaign to fight for an empire zone in the county
476979 the mccain campaign was compelled to respond to this outrageous attack because we will not allow john mccain to be smeared by senator obama as a racist for offering legitimate criticism
476980 we have waited for months with a sick feeling knowing this moment would come because we watched it incur with president clinton say whatever you want about president clinton his record on this issue is above reproach

477022 increased global demand and dwindling reserves play their role but dont forget the effect of weather in determining oil costs
477023 driving past a gas station has become a scarier experience than any horror flick hollywood has released this
477024 the recent record highs for retail oil prices also add to inflation by increasing the costs of everything from packaging to transportation
477025 the weather can change in a single day and prices could easily turn upwards

477047 in adilabad district alone 1100 hectares of forest area has been cleared of trees and in some places such as kawal wildlife sanctuary trees are being felled by people in the sanctuary area
477048 the act came into effect after a decade of struggle it gives tribals legal claim on this land which is their traditional land and their right
477049 if you consider such cases the act is a progressive one
477050 tribals have emotional psychological and cultural attachments with the forest and they always lived in the forest non tribal forest dwellers do not take livelihood activities in forests by choice
477051 we had found that people who had migrated from neighbouring nations too had become landlords in this forest land so who is the final beneficiary of this act
477052 even conservationists have a problem with the act and describe it as the end of forests in india but people are part of the environment there can be no wilderness without people
477053 this is fear mongering evacuations of tribals are still continuing
477054 earlier scholarships and reimbursement of tuition fee were affected by embezzlements to curtail it and to bring in transparency we have introduced this concept of making the stakeholders take up social audit such studies would be taken up at other government colleges in the near future

477077 the weekend before i was due to deliver my working prototypes of the windows sentinel web and mobile front ends i saw that the adobe air sdk and the companion plug ins for dreamweaver and flash had just been released for download i figured lets see what air can do less than two hours later i was able to essentially export my mobile web pages into desktop widgets better adobe air produces a single executable that runs on windows xp windows vista and mac os x leopard and soon linux
477078 i think most organizations will discover that dreamweaver and flash have magically become an easy lightweight development platform that a wider range of employees can put to good effect than could ever use a full blown ide
477079 alright maam im sorry about that i cant tell you that yes it is pretty damn unreasonable that youre paying more than the ticket to canada for a few hours on the internet because my manager would fire me if i displayed any signs of humanity and thank you and have a wonderful day we appreciate doing business with you is there anything else i can do for you
477080 the problem with air is that unlike firefox which allows for tabbed browsing there is no way to launch one air client and get multiple services id like to have twhirl alertthingy and shifd another cool air client all running at the same time in different tabs

477256 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
477257 i became extremely friendly and fond of the police officers who protected me

477263 i am not in the business of suppressing books i just want the stuff taken out of which he knows to be untrue
477264 this is not just my reputation at stake apart from making me look bad hes made the entire police force look bad
477265 i am taking the action because i feel loyal towards those people who risked their lives for me
477266 they are being accused of all sorts of things and yet no one seems to be defending them

477292 there will be no deadline and liverpool have all the time in the world now to sign gareth barry
477293 we were very buoyant and optimistic that everything could come back to normal again
477294 that wasnt to be though on thursday there was a meeting between gareths agent myself and the player they still felt that even though the deadline had passed they still felt liverpool were going to come in and do the deal
477295 obviously i was disappointed to hear that gareths head is a bit all over the place at the moment and they asked for some more time
477296 so ive listened to what theyve said and ill go with it reluctantly but ill go with it
477297 there will be no deadline and liverpool have all the time in the world now to sign gareth barry theyve got up to the normal window which is the 31st of this month
477298 so its really up to them gareth and his agent to sort it out ive decided this is the only way forward for us really
477299 i have a football club to run and i really do want people who want to play for us
477300 if liverpool at the end of it all do not come up with the money thats no one elses fault but their own
477301 id be delighted if that was the case and gareth stayed but i would doubt that very much the ball is very much in their court

477373 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to
477374 why then is it such a big issue for barack obama
477375 i was sitting in a hotel in los angeles and the producer tim bevan came to me and said would you make elizabeth and i thought what an adventurous idea what an adventurous producer because i had no knowledge of history all i knew about her was that she was the renaissance queen the virgin queen i found myself saying yes just for the adventure of it then i thought better of it and called tim and said look im in two minds the costume drama is one of my least favourite film genres
477376 and so i did trainspotting freed me up from the strictures of western cinema i found it an incredibly liberating film it was a film that lived on the edge of the current grammar of filmmaking and then broke through
477377 it wasnt that i tried to emulate anything in trainspotting it just helped me break this anxiety i had that i was coming from india id never shot a film overseas before and id have to confine myself to what a british film should be
477378 once i got into shooting it my filmmaking roots kicked in the colours the non fear of melodrama trainspotting is a very melodramatic film but that synchs perfectly with the lives of these people
477379 that was horrific but it was hypnotic you are repulsed by it but you never disconnect from it it never stopped being cinematic
477380 i dont think it was pro drugs it was a brilliant insight into the lives of people who take drugs it wasnt moralistic but i dont think anybody could have watched it and thought great thats what i want to do quite the contrary
477381 trainspotting is one of those films kubricks a clockwork orange is another that we can look back on now and realise just how challenging it was dramatically theyre both films that come from completely brilliant minds
477382 but pray nataraja why did you allow yourself to be entangled in parbati in those four forces in the first instance
477383 entangled entangled he says hooooh who says i ve been entangled ever it s the vested interests of the people like you to first show me entangled and then struggling to get disentangled with what else will you you funny scribblers otherwise fill your books
477384 but but those tears in your eyes your accusing finger towards parbati
477385 oh that i see one of those stormy visions of yours
477386 you dream all sorts of dreams and then you say i who am to you as you re to your dreams am entangled in them are you entangled in your dreams you are not entangled my child though you may feel so while dreaming wouldn t you yourself laugh if one of your dream creatures were to ask you questions involving your first instances first go and exhaust your dream go and write your dreamy book go and win your dreamy name fame and fortune only then you will know of my first instances while dreaming ye may not talk of first instances lest talking of first instances ye may lose your dreaming mid way through
477387 i think the plans change with our intentions and our detachment to results i think god values it
477388 when i have x million dollars then ill be secure then ill be financially independent and i will retire then i will do all the things i really want to do
477389 anyone can make things complex but it takes a lot of courage to go in the other direction to simplify things
477390 there is no denying the fact that with each new scientific theory we are actually going deeper and deeper into the heart of the matter not only figuratively but literally as well
477391 nothing that cant be found in my big fat greek wedding
477392 the stories were sometimes difficult to listen to we found that all the prisoners we met played with our emotions
477393 the prisoners had portrayed their stories as such normal incidents that in my mind i started to see these crimes as lesser offences
477394 you dont want people normalising sanitising glamorising drug use murder and anti social behaviour
477395 its a really good wake up call for them a lesson they should be more careful and critical
477396 the kids are intrigued they hang on every word it teaches them some important lessons weve never had any problems at all
477397 they should not have linked the security and the legal issues in darfur this is international justice
477398 they havent made a full commitment to really say that they are going to delay the courts work
477399 all these countries are dictatorships and many violate human rights and commit crimes against their people
477400 they are afraid also to be accused and go to the court
477401 as an african i feel embarrassed and shocked by the action of the african union
477402 if the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe then man would only have four years of life left
477403 god doesnot interfere with the little independence of the living entity the highest knowledge to you is to surrender unto the heart pure consciousness and you may act as you like
477404 god doesnot interfere with the little independence of the living entity nor does the supreme assume anyones sinful or pious activities embodied beings however are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge a living entity actually is of supreme nature is prone to be influenced by ignorance he has the capacity to minutely desire by his free will which is fulfilled by the forces laws of nature which again is supreme but the supreme is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired the highest knowledge for a living entity is to surrender unto the supreme within ones heart into the state of pure consciousness and then may act as one likes that is the best way to be in harmony with the existence and take up the instructions of the universe following ones destiny in other words
477405 elections will suck out the energy from the growth of the country and the result will be yet another indecisive coalition with each partner looking after only its own self interest no leader will be strong enough to take decisions crucial to stop the economy from skidding
477406 4 secure india s full and active participation in united states efforts to dissuade isolate and if necessary sanction and contain iran for its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction including a nuclear weapons capability and the capability to enrich uranium or reprocess nuclear fuel and the means to deliver weapons of mass destruction
477407 a member of the hamas police and a member of the ezzedine al qassam brigades the military wing of hamas were martyred
477408 after the 11th i was hoping to get to 5 or 6 under and still have a chance
477409 today was a little better more regular golf i missed a few shots here and there but i kept going and when you hole a shot like that on the 11th it keeps the momentum going
477410 what was really special was coming down the last eight with that great support teeing up so early compared with leaders we still had a huge crowd and it was very special coming up 18 i hope it will be like that tomorrow
477411 we have prepared three sketches of suspects based on description given by an eye witness who saw them planting the bombs in different parts of the city
477412 we have decided to not make those sketches public at this stage as it will hamper the probe
477413 it seems that the material for bombs came from outside the state but it is likely that they were assembled here since items like batteries and watches are found locally we believe that the assembly could have been done here
477414 this it project will also be using projectors which would be operated from one control center manned by a few instructors in a bid to reach many students
477415 chief justice chase t rogers and i believe the new rules will help the public greatly particularly since finding a cell phone without a camera these days is extremely difficult
477416 as important we hope that allowing people to bring in their camera phones will shorten the lines at the metal detector
477417 especially when you consider that the marshals bagged and tagged 290 000 camera phones last year
477418 i really want to do this but im afraid im rushing things and im just going to end up ruining the night im just going to go
477419 u are so hot woke up so horny from last night finish what we started
477420 yes but you have to stop when i tell you to stop

477425 the sky done clouded over after glory fckn suns debut album yielding this brooding and corrosive follow up the new zealand sorta super group of antony milton ben spiers and simon ororke concoct a slow burning behemoth of metallic shivers and distortion churn dark enough to invoke the dread name haino spectra is an unsettling mind meld spiers desolate soundscapes bleed into miltons heavy drones which are complemented perfectly by ororkes restless percussion group improvisation is the natural language of these three even listing their solo and collaborative albums over the past decade would take way more effort than i can muster suffice to say this is a stellar and unique record to add to their massive discographies
477426 the fourth album by the sample sculptor of finlands oulu features only one long piece of sound slowly and ponderously developing sound mass moves between minimalist ambient and melodic sequences both beautiful and mentally jarring it is both organic and spacy almost at the same time
477427 eva of kevin shields gang wizard and britnay of married in berdichev explore the relationship of love songs and harsh noise beautiful singing lost harmonies and bonebreaking thrash

477435 in the past marcia bassett of double leopards ghq has proved her versaitility under the zaimph name from the depraved feedback and tone fury of her
477436 still moving loops repeat and build themselves in deep washes of aural hallucination
477437 portlands tone wrangler aaron davis aka acre has been blasting the world with his massive but barely there feedback swells for quite some time with releases on black horizons jk and more his first lp offering brings about the acre essence quite well massive walls of shoe gazed feedback are some how tamed into smooth quintessential drones this is not the sound of synthesizers or keyboards but a single tone being modified and replicated into a monolithic piece stasis so strong it is hard to realize the power of these two side long tracks until they end forcing silence back upon the listener direct hypnosis and transcendental zoning
477438 spirited youth and the intense magnification of focused energies chart the recent zones for treetops
477439 slick new project featuring eva of kevin sheilds and brittany of married in berdichev swamp and hive noise laced with lulling vocal drones bleeding to full obliteration almost two insane opposites making one very cool new vibe totally wild

477442 whilst chilling on a train i got an email from this guy vincent who is
477443 transmitting from france the soulighters guitars woodwinds keys and percussion offer a stumbling drunken clatter and drone that settles itself upon the listener like a blanket of warm confusion and guides the ear deep into a thick forest of drawn out pulses and reverberations ultimately manifesting itself in a ritualistic ambience with serpentine flashing and circular hum like church music if god were not only real but serious about his head
477444 austin texas produces yet another glorious batch of sublime freaks growing a glooping pulsating garden of acid fried driftetables and deconstructed space blooms vast open vistas of echoed out cosmic tones all given depth and dimension by the wandering lonely wails of human women folk blending all within a dream teetering on the edge of nightmare

477449 cdr edition of 100 the first time i saw these two play i was sitting totally sober in the back of a warehouse in purchase ny maybe it was the hours of simpsons arcade game i had just finished but it was one of the most focused and engaging shows i had seen in ages later that night i approached mir about working together and 9 month later this finally sees the light of day both diaphragm and migrations in rust contribute one slow burner each with a collaborative track to finish things off somewhere between the space of andrew chalk layers of birchville cat motel and the sinister atmosphere of abruptum
477450 c40 edition of 100 i first got this master while watering plants at a local mall every week i would go in at night strap on a full body harness lock myself to the railing jump over the side and go to work on hundreds of plants while continuously flipping this tape over and over the perfect soundtrack to floating three stories up while breathing in harsh chemical fertilizers and watching the leaves fall on the janitors below the title track is one of the best helm tracks to date forward moving phase shifts buried under blankets of high end pulses only subsiding to make room for some of the most inviting tones this side of tangerine dream side bs hearts like broken motors is a full 19 minutes of new age synth onslaught covers designed and printed by james livingston of black horizons 12 were printed on tan paper the remaining on black please dont ask for a specific color cover black high bias chrome tapes
477451 incredible new set from phil legard xenis emputae travelling band ashtray navigations larkfall label dredged and presented in accordance with his peerless and undisputed knowledge of subterranean rock of the last 30 years track one lets you know what to expect kicking off with an unholy marriage of cosi fanni tutti guitar scrabble and bob calvert sci fi paranoia before the dam breaks and the whole mess is filtered through a broken watkins copicat manhandled by joe meek on a bad hair day 60s garage scuzz crashes head on with overheated and badly wired analogue synths all combined with an innate knowledge and respect for today s current noise practitioners a breathtaking release made all the more incredible by legard s accompanying artwork
477452 richard skelton presides over every aspect of the beautifully presented releases on his sustain release label a project initiated in memorandum to his wife louise the weight of which can be felt in all that skelton produces from the hand crafted and personalised edition of one cd s featuring louise s photographs of the surrounding lancashire landscape to the heartfelt and considered music contained within firstperson is very proud to be the first to release skelton s music outside of his own label a trend that will continue with future releases on students of decay amongst others for this release we are treated to a slowly unfolding meditation on the sonorities of the violin an elegiac and minimalistic rendition in the mould of arvo part or anton batagov this is music of substance that lingers long after it recedes into silence
477453 tapping into his french heritage through the work of the musique concrete pioneers maxime primault uses the world around him as his source material the results are first rate exercises in electro acoustic manipulation in which tones are shaped and matched to produce attenuated and considered drone studies primault also takes time out to run the crier dans les mus es label notable for the compilation cris et chuchotements featuring likeminded artists such as peter wright valerio cosi kuupuu and ghost brames of the cerfs
477454 fraser burnett has quietly built up an assured reputation for consistent and solid releases for labels such as lee stokoe s matching head blackest rainbow recently sharing a split lp with culver and his own pjorn imprint in an overcrowded genre sitting through another slab of drone music can sometimes feel like a laborious and thankless task however what works for me in this instance is the utter sincerity with which each release arrives i get the impression that none of this music is forced no hip references or longing to be part of it whatever the fuck it is seven tracks of subtle brain melt that could easily stretch to an hour each a canny tactic that has you reaching for the play button as soon as it s over
477455 welcome to the world of marky loo loo along with phil todd ashtray navigations and joincey stuckometer puff loo loo was an integral element in the majority of the outfits to evolve from the stoke on trent noise tape underground of the 90s his list of projects during this period is exhaustive with phil todd he birthed the all out electronic noise of dogliveroil and with the addition of joincey they formed the ultimate noise rock power trio target shoppers famously sharing a split 7 with melt banana as far back as 1995 other notable outings included turps with prince tun hock with joincey jaundice bogbush cosmos front door enemy the delightfully named i am not sitting next to you he who farts like loud water not to mention his inimitable contributions to the live ensembles tea culture and boit unique and his ill fated foray into magazine publication with warm heart wet arse the subs began around the start of the 90s as a project conceived entirely on the amiga 500 in order to reflect loo loo s combined love of electro pop a la the army of lovers obscure japanese anime the film music of john carpenter bootsy collins and death metal enlisting the help of paula hayes on shared vocals the carpenters for the 90s as one gig flyer read they released the 17 song cassette going like the clappers on phil todd s betley welcomes careful drivers label including such instant pop classics as qwerty and i have a key they also contributed to the infamous 7 x 7 box set released by stomach ache their track snow in my pocket depicted a love affair with a snowman that could only end in disaster their finest moment however was the release of the legendary and possibly their finest song leg in heart as a split lathe cut 7 with inca eyeball who also covered the song on the quattros symbolos cd for spirit of orr criminally limited to a mere 25 copies as part of this latest set of songs we at firstperson are more than a little proud to present the aforementioned leg in heart in its original form with vocals by loo loo himself the release of this current slim selection from a back catalogue totalling around 400 songs is the result of a personal quest by firstperson to see in print in one form or another once more the utterly original vision of marky loo loo you are welcome
477456 the end of the firstperson label comes in the form of the third release for fp from phil todd s psychedelic behemoth ensemble two tracks of shortwave static low end rumble and searing guitar pyrotechnics from possibly the most consistently on form artist the uk underground has produced it is fitting that the last release should come from todd whose betley welcomes careful drivers imprint and rigid commitment to a sustained and formidable work ethic formed an early and undeniable influence

477491 this is to remind us of the gravity of the circumstances in which al aqsa mosque is in this age
477492 the jews dreamed of establishing a state in the land of palestine and managed to achieve that dream that being so we at least must not give up hope that one day we will again have al aqsa mosque and jerusalem under our control we should not lose hope of that at all even if we see surrender embodied everywhere in our status quo

477524 many airlines including qantas are actively evaluating the feasibility of cleaner jet fuels
477525 availability on a global scale is still five to 10 years away but the current fuel crisis combined with an increasing focus on environmental concerns have accelerated the development path
477526 biofuels may deliver significant environmental and economic benefits including lower carbon emissions
477527 under the federal governments carbon pollution reduction system as with the eu and new zealand schemes consumption of biofuels is zero rated that means biofuels do not attract any charge
477528 the government is also proposing to provide funding under the climate change action fund for research and rapid commercialisation of low emission fuel sources this increases the incentive for our industry to develop drop in biofuels as quickly as possible
477529 we plan to test fly a 747 this year using the nut to power one engine
477530 we would not do it if it meant replacing food crops or forests for fuel nut plantations it has to be socially acceptable
477531 if it does work as hoped it would be a great alternative it releases less co2 when used and it takes in co2 when it is growing
477532 we are confident our hard work with partners like boeing together with efforts of many of our peers will see a step change sooner than many people realise
477533 this fundamental shift in fuel options should be embraced by the industry and we aim to see at least 10 per cent of our total annual needs coming from environmentally sustainable fuels by 2013
477534 it costs us 225 000 in fuel to fly a 747 from los angeles to auckland but only 165 000 to fly a 777 on the same route

477543 since late 1989 the indian state of jammu and kashmir j amp k has been in the grip of a vicious movement of islamist extremist terrorism as many as 36 289 till december 30 2003 lives have been lost in this conflict over nearly 14 years of a sub conventional war that has inflicted enormous suffering on the people of the state and transformed this confrontation between south asia s traditional rivals into a potential nuclear flashpoint
477544 ethnic cleansing was evidently a systematic component of the terrorists strategic agenda in j amp k and estimates suggest that just between february and march 1990 140 000 to 160 000 pandits had fled the kashmir valley to jammu delhi or other parts of the country

477547 but although there is a new sense of identity in the nation pride in its language dating back to the 6th century its own literary tradition and a sense of belonging to a particular area of land when we talk of nation nationalism nationhood the debate can become very heated
477548 we have seen and are still seeing the cost in human terms of the struggle for national identity in various parts of the world we have seen what has happened in yugoslavia israel palestine and parts of africa
477549 the challenge we face as a nation is keeping our identity and rejoicing in it without at the same time becoming narrowly nationalistic xenophobic even or exclusive
477550 it is quite a normal thing for humans to do and yet it can be one of the most demonic as we realise when we study any period of history
477551 a lot of people look at mountain top removal mining as a negative but i see it as a positive we need to stop apologizing for coal i want us to promote mountain top removal because we need flat land we can not have economic expansion without places to do things and part of mountain top removal is for places like hospitals airports and different type of merchants

477556 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
477557 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
477558 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
477559 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
477560 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
477561 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

477570 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
477571 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
477572 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
477573 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
477574 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
477575 by obstructing these compromise proposals to investigate unsolved civil rights crimes and protect children without borrowing more money the senate leadership is denying justice to victims of the past present and future generations it is also sending a message that congress defiantly refuses to live within its means and will not even consider paying for new spending by cutting wasteful washington spending what we have seen this week is a cynical ploy from democratic leaders to use victims of crime diseases and other calamities as props in a partisan political campaign these tactics have embarrassed and discredited the senate and helped reinforce its nine percent approval rating
477576 the decision by senate democratic leaders to obstruct a compromise supported by alvin sykes the president of the emmett till justice campaign and senator dodd the sponsor of the bill is deplorable and indefensible the emmett till compromise would simply require senate democratic leaders to acknowledge that congress should live within its means like every american family the compromise would require the department of justice to prioritize existing funds in order to fund this effort this step was necessary because senate democratic leaders had no intention to fund this program this year even as they accused me of obstruction and harboring other base motives
477577 there is no reason for democratic leaders to insist that these bills pass only in the context of their so called tomnibus bill that was soundly rejected and viewed as an exercise in demagoguery and mindless partisanship democratic leaders can now explain why they have drawn a moral equivalence between victims of civil rights crimes and online predators on one side and botanical gardens and war of 1812 commemorations on the other side senators were elected to set priorities and no normal person would say these causes deserve equal attention
477578 senate democratic leaders also objected last night to legislation designed to protect children from online pornography and exploitation their only basis for objecting was their insistence that this legislation can only pass in a package that also includes legislation regulating the interstate commerce of non human primates
477579 1 i personally dont get the issue of racism as inherent in debate this topic came up last summer and i remember noting a number of students of african decent

477624 councils have a duty not only to provide value for money to local people but also to tell people what they get for the tax they pay without explaining what a council does in proper english then local people will fail to understand its relevance to them or why they should bother to turn out and vote unless information is given to people to explain why their council matters then local democracy will be threatened with extinction

477630 good reason for israel to make a precipitate strike at iranian nuclear capacity
477631 will act to stop iran aquiring nuclear weapons while it can still be stopped without the risk of a nuclear strike against israel
477632 in the name of what alternative would we condemn israel
477633 our point of view is not that of israeli or any other nationalism we want israeli palestinian iranian and other workers to unite and fight for a socialist middle east however least of all should we back ahmadinejad or argue implicitly or openly that homicidal religious lunatics have a right to arm themselves with nuclear weapons and that those they say they want to destroy should be condemned for refusing to stand idly by while they arm themselves to do the job
477634 an attack on iran will most likely lead to great carnage in the middle east and beyond as supporters of iran resort to suicide bombings in retaliation there might well be large scale iranian civilian collateral casualties it would throw iraq back into the worst chaos
477635 a state whose clerical fascist rulers might see a nuclear armageddon involving a retaliatory israeli nuclear strike against iran in the way a god crazed suicide bomber sees blowing himself to pieces
477636 in the last reckoning here israel is no states puppet it has pressing concerns of its own and will act on them
477637 israel has been given a role not unlike a watchdog should the west prefer for one reason or another to close its eyes one can rely on israel to punish severely those of the neighbouring states whose lack of manners towards the west has exceeded the proper limits
477638 expressed in duff anti imperialism pretend one sided pacifism and hysterical appeals to international law and the un will be the response of the kitsch left to an israeli attack
477639 a thorough and rigorous open debate in their ranks would split the group

477661 it is clear that provinces were heard concerns about confessionalism were allayed there were serious efforts to address the central role of worship and prayer in holding us together
477662 almost all the canadian concerns were addressed in this draft
477663 we believe that it has taken into account concerns expressed about the role of the primates meeting and provides a much clearer recognition of the role of laity and of the synodical decision making processes in dioceses and provinces throughout the communion
477664 there was a distinct change in tone in the language of the appendix and that while the tentative and provisional nature of the procedures outlined in the appendix is highlighted in both the communiqu and the commentary its presence as the only possible option for conflict resolution gives it greater significance than we believe is either intended or warranted
477665 while this is an ecclesiological question it needs to be answered so that all readers understand the same thing it also may have impact on who approves the covenant

477777 the old national intelligence system in place on september 11 was destined to fail
477778 in the days before september 11 the wall specifically impeded the investigation into zacarias moussaoui khalid al midhar and nawaf al hazmi

478016 for many spirits dwell in it the body and do not permit it to be pure each of them brings to fruition its own works and they treat it abusively by means of unseemly desires to me it seems that the heart suffers in much the same way as an inn for it has holes and trenches dug in it and is often filled with filth by men who live there licentiously and have no regard for the place because it belongs to another
478017 is that youre simply encapsulated and dumped in the gulf of lower california to hell with ya if you can get out of that and wander around through cities and find some girl who looks like shes going to have a baby or get married youre all set you eventually just pick up a baby
478018 sex is an extremely important part of my life it is a great release of tension and stress i dont have time for a relationship at work i am in a high position of power therefore i find it a great turn on to be taken charge of by a man who is really confident about themselves and their body unfortunately many men dont posses this kind of confidence or the right size package penis size is actually fairly important to me which i suppose is quite sad recently i slept with a man who was lovely good looking etc etc but had the smallest penis ive ever seen i nearly laughed when i saw it i just couldnt help myself when it was all over i ended up going into the bathroom and satisfying myself not the ideal situation however i have had some successes with more average men but not very many i suppose it makes me sound shallow but in my mind there is no point in having bad sex i can quite happily satisfy myself if need be in my experience men who are larger do make better lovers they possess a higher level of confidence which alone is much more of a turn on a partner who is confident within themselves and their body is more likely to know what he wants and be able to satisfy me length is not the most important factor for me girth is ill never forget one man who had at least an 8 inch penis but it was the thinnest weakest looking thing id ever seen a good large girth usually means a stronger more flexible penis this is reflected in the length and control a man displays during sex leading to greater satisfaction up to a point it is what you do with it but if you do it with a large penis the results for me are greater and leave a lasting impression
478019 my partner and i have been together for what seems like forever were very happy together although i dont think we will get married the idea just doesnt appeal to us were happy as we are not everything has always been so smooth though it took along time for our sex life to be up to standard when we first got together it became apparent fairly quickly that i had a much greater sex drive than him sometimes he simply wasnt interested this began to affect the rest of our relationship i began to doubt myself his love and our trust he simply wasnt interested and when he was it lacked something we both decided that something must be done or our relationship would suffer further we talked at great length about what the problem was he felt he wasnt confident enough or big enough i agreed he wasnt confident enough but he was big enough at 6 5 inches he was certainly ample for me he decided to take matters into his own hands and he declared that we couldnt have sex for 4 weeks in this time he began doing exercises to strengthen his penis which in turn would give him more confidence at first i do admit i had my doubts it sounded almost sleazy and dodgy but my relationship was on the line here i was willing to try anything to prevent losing the man that i loved after the 4 week period we resumed sexual activity the change in him was amazing his penis was thicker and stronger looking this change was reflected in his confidence level and his performance we took the plunge and have never looked back our sex life is now fantastic i still dont know what exercises he does and i dont want to all i know is that they have changed our relationship i never thought that sex could have such a bearing on your life and relationships im just glad we got it sorted before it was too late

478022 brazil will certainly assume its responsibility to preserve the amazon to combat global warming
478023 talk as if they own the amazon but we know what it represents to humanity and to brazil and what needs to be done will be done
478024 our war isnt against last months deforestation numbers its against a model that leaves people impoverished and that destroys the rainforest
478025 this is the first time brazil is accepting the link between global warming and preserving the forest
478026 for a long time brazil was violently opposed to this insisting fossil fuel was to blame thats true historically speaking but today forests play an important role
478027 its better for the countrys image to do things right so we can walk in international forums with our heads high
478028 we want the sovereignty that we hold over amazonian territory and the decisions that are made in this region to be respected
478029 the fund is a vehicle by which foreign governments can help support our initiatives without exerting any influence over our national policy
478030 for a long time brazil was violently opposed to this insisting fossil fuel was to blame
478031 thats true historically speaking but today forests play an important role
478032 we are committed to reducing the destruction of the rainforest to eliminating illegal burning and to guaranteeing a better quality of life for all
478033 initial euphoria was soon dampened by indications admittedly in rather obscure places that the new world of peace and democracy would face some teething problems
478034 the collapse of the communist superpower the soviet union is the single most important event prompting the exponential growth of organized crime around the world in the last two decades almost overnight it provoked a chaotic scramble for riches and survival that saw virtually every citizen sucked into a vortex of violence from the bitter wars of the caucasus to the shoot outs in towns and cities this was a deadly environment as a new class of capitalists exploited the vacuum of power by seizing whole industries and raiding the state coffers accompanied by an orgy of consumption and decadent behavior last witnessed a century ago under czar nicholas even such mighty organizations as the kgb and the red army became quickly embroiled in this spectacular nightmare the transformation traveled well beyond the soviet unions borders into all continents of the world as money poured out of the country looking for safe havens some legal but most decidedly dodgy throbbing at the heart of these extraordinary events was moscow

478041 those who positioned themselves well in the first three years after the end of communism were often in a position to make up the rules of their brave new world as they went along
478042 in the late 1980s the west began to liberalize its financial markets
478043 it was here in the huge reservoirs of the international banking system that the liquid assets of the corporate and criminal worlds mixed and mingled very quickly it became impossible to separate the two while crime groups big and small took full advantage of the globalization of finance they were not required to explain their actions before an antitrust commission nor did they have to abide by the rules of the world trade organization and its predecessor
478044 money was being shifted about with an unimagined ease and nobody was keeping track of it
478045 if we fail to construct an adequate regulatory mechanism that is some form of global governance then organized crime and corruption will combine with protectionism and chauvinism to engender a very unstable and very dangerous world
478046 will have as much access and influence over the course and direction of our campaign that has traditionally been reserved for the wealthy and the powerful

478069 we were excited we told our friends and family the good news did whatever little things we could to prepare ourselves to be parents

478071 i feel really really sad for her to think whats going on in her life to do something this terrible to someone else
478072 im also pretty angry and i want to make sure she gets whatever punishment she has coming to her she certainly deserves it
478073 it doesnt get much lower than that ive got to say
478074 some of you have some thoughts youd like to share about yesterdays sketch on the premature presidency of barack obama
478075 ive decided to approach todays chat as a wine writer would today i am inaugurating the whine enthusiast in which i will rate your whines
478076 g a ve british prime minister gordon brown some management advice over the weekend
478077 this column incorrectly said that sen barack obama shared his views on how to avoid micromanagement with british prime minister gordon brown last saturday obama shared those views with british opposition leader david cameron
478078 inside according to a witness he told the house members this is the moment
478079 milbank cited the quote in support of his thesis that obama was becoming a
478080 i do wonder whether or not echoing a rovian talking point complete with misquote is really your best starting point
478081 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
478082 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
478083 there were lots of good natured drivers we thought we would get a bit of grief but everyone has been really supportive
478084 it is about direct action outside the camp we will break the law or do whatever needs to take place to stop e on peacefully from profiting from climate change
478085 we are planning to shut the coal fired power station down and we are planning to come back when they create a new coal fired power station
478086 its not like that change means were going to run out of coal in the next 10 years
478087 a lot of times we talk about the united states as the saudi arabia of coal that type of thing
478088 a lot of people would question how accurate is that because there really hasnt ever been a real in depth analysis like what were trying to do with this gillette coal field
478089 i think thats a pretty important number to have in terms of long term energy planning that sort of thing
478090 this is why we started with the gillette coal field in this new assessment
478091 it is the single most important coal field in the united states right now in terms of total production
478092 the state should lead by example and move away from our dependence on coal at the state owned heating plants in madison
478093 this sends a strong message that our longtime overdependence on coal is coming to a close
478094 coal absolutely has to be considered part of the fuel mix of wisconsin

478097 unless the growth of radical islam is curbed in ethiopia the attacks against christians will continue to rise ethiopian government officials particularly local officials in muslim dominated areas of the country should be made accountable for failing to protect christians against such attacks
478098 somali christians are paying the ultimate price for their faith in jesus christ despite the spike in persecution they face they have chosen to trust in the lord jesus christ to the point of death christians should continue to pray and support their brothers and sisters in somalia

478103 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
478104 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
478105 would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
478106 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
478107 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong
478108 as this stance gives him the final option most notably after the election to simply say no
478109 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
478110 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
478111 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign

478123 de vrije meningsuiting is de chape van gewapend beton waarop alle activisme berust
478124 onderschat niet dat termen als politiek correct door rechts gekaapt zijn heel dit debat zelfs de verlichting is ingepalmd door rechts het vb kaapt de vrije meningsuiting wie het vb bekritiseert heet tegen de vrije meningsuiting te zijn
478125 in het debat over vrije meningsuiting zo weinig zinnigs gezegd wordt
478126 daar alleen is t leven goed waar men stil en ongedwongen alles voor elkander doet
478127 de media zijn geen blok er is geen samenzwering alleen een sfeer die extreme tendenzen uitvergroot omdat die voor een goed verhaal zorgen bovendien zijn de massamedia niet meer zo almachtig
478128 extreemrechts heeft geen insteek in de grote media tenzij juist door een term als vrije meningsuiting te kapen
478129 woorden zijn belangrijk zo was tolerantie een zeer domme woordkeuze die heeft ons tien jaar gekost
478130 het vb cre ert een eigen logica links doet dat niet en als een linkse zoiets doet wordt hij door andere linksen van collaboratie beschuldigd
478131 het absoluut recht op vrije meningsuiting heeft nooit bestaan het is altijd beperkt door talloze wetten en regels tegenwoordig moeten we in naam van de vrije meningsuiting allerlei kwakzalverij aanhoren die niet op kennis gebaseerd is
478132 ik deel niet de mening dat de repressie het werk is van rechts met links als slachtoffer
478133 toen de hofstadgroep vervolgd werd de groep waartoe mohammed bouyeri behoorde maar waarvan de andere leden geen criminele daden gesteld hadden protesteerde juist ayaan hirsi ali tegen die vervolging van een louter opinie
478134 als er geen eenzijdigheid mag zijn dan is er geen vrije meningsuiting als je links bent zeg dan gewoon openlijk dat eric goeman en zijn debatten eenzijdig zijn zonder eenzijdigheid geen vrije meningsuiting
478135 als groepen tegen elkaar opgezet worden dan moet je niet lullen van ik kan hier zeggen wat ik wil want het heeft gevolgen ayaan heeft het recht om haar mening te uiten maar er zijn gelukkig wetten op racisme dat heeft niks te maken met vrije meningsuiting maar met een stap hoger propaganda
478136 links doet tegenwoordig bang en verward veel linksen vinden zelfs dat de deense cartoons moeten kunnen
478137 we moeten niet na ef zijn door de commerci le dimensie krijgen radicalen gemakkelijk het woord links is zelf ook ge volueerd de morgen is destijds gered door een pact met de commercie
478138 rechts controleert dit debat de juridische benadering met beperkende wetten raakt zo in de verdrukking zelfs yves desmet komt op voor het recht op beledigen
478139 de media controleren de meningsuiting zij bepleiten wel de absolute vrije meningsuiting maar selecteren intussen zelf wel wat er wel en wat er niet gepubliceerd geraakt volgens eigen criteria w l bart de wever of jean marie dedecker maar niet de complexere standpunten van bv de sociale organisaties
478140 toegelaten ja maar wat is de kwaliteit van ayaans discours dan is het een deel van mijn vrije meningsuiting om haar te bekritiseren
478141 als toerist trek je je schoenen wanneer je een moskee betreedt
478142 vrije meningsuiting was zeer belangrijk om ons te bevrijden van het juk van de kerk in de identiteitsvorming rond de verlichting in de scheiding tussen kerk en staat plots is daar dan de ander met zijn sjaria en zonder scheiding van kerk en staat dat is een karikatuur ik betreur die polarisering pro vrije meningsuiting of contra geen middenweg van laten we toch ook respect opbrengen voor anderen
478143 de maatschappij is meer dan de som van mensen er zijn ook structuren die overigens heel wat meer zijn dan de markt lief en goed zijn is niet goed genoeg
478144 misschien is met die wetten die infiltratie en afluistering toelaten wel een aanslag voork men mensenlevens gered tenslotte is het veiligheidsprobleem re el bij de aanslagen in new york en madrid en zo zijn er wel degelijk mensen gestorven
478145 het is aan de vrije meningsuiting te danken dat theo van gogh en ayaan hirsi ali beroemd geworden zijn
478146 de sterkte van rechts is dat links zeer schizofreen bezig is
478147 wat ik bij jou niet tof vind is dat simplisme dat maakt het debat kapot
478148 als je alles mag zeggen d n is er debat jij wil het debat voork men
478149 ik schrik ervan hoe jij de vrije meningsuiting niet steunt
478150 ik hoor iedereen hier zeggen dat de vrije meningsuiting ingeperkt moet worden
478151 ik zeg alleen dat het sop de kool niet waard is zoiets als op een foto van je moeder spuwen
478152 wie godsdienst een gevaarlijk misverstand vindt die wil jij kristien niet ter hulp komen
478153 natuurlijk moet iedereen zoiets kunnen publiceren maar dat is nog iets anders dan zich voor de kar van rechts te laten spannen
478154 voor de kar laten spannen dat is een z r gevaarlijke uitdrukking ze betekent dat je een idee niet mag hebben als een fout iemand er ook zo over denkt
478155 het verbod op belediging zou van alles verbieden zo is er een affiche tegen het neoliberalisme van frits bolkestein waarin deze beschuldigd wordt van volgend armoedebeleid bestrijd de armoede dood een bedelaar dat is toch een belediging voor bolkestein dat roept toch op tot haat tegen hem elke politieke stelling kan gelezen worden als een oproep tot haat al is het maar haat tegen onrecht met een verbod op belediging zou die linkse affiche verboden moeten worden

478177 he will tell the council that keeping sufficient oil quantities underground is a good investment for the future as oil prices will then be higher he will argue that this will be better than producing more oil and generating financial surpluses on the grounds these surpluses are causing inflation
478178 the level of oil production in saudi arabia must be linked to the countrys actual development and financial needs not to market prices and the need of foreign consumer my emphasis techfun it is not wise to sap this resource just to satisfy the demand of foreign markets
478179 when you face these kinds of global problems you need as prime minister someone who is respected on the international stage someone whose hard work and ability over the last 11 years has made britain better off thats why ive no doubt that gordon brown is the right person for the job

478189 two salient theories of scroll origins namely 1 the old qumran essene theory and 2 the jerusalem libraries theory which has come to be increasingly supported by the newer generation of scholars
478190 announced roster of lecturers is stacked with scholars who support the old qumran essene theory of scroll origins without including a single opponent of it
478191 are well versed in the variety of theories and hypotheses concerning the scrolls and have sought to present facts based on current scholarly consensus as well as considered analysis of the evidence including the variety of theories posited by golb and others
478192 puts a spotlight on the danger of entrusting an exhibit on a topic of this importance not to a specialist in history archaeology or hebrew manuscript investigation but to a professor of religious studies who describes herself as a dead sea scrolls scholar even though no publication by her on this subject appears in her bibliography
478193 take claims about dead sea scrolls with a grain of salt
478194 a sophisticated media campaign has accompanied all the current exhibits aimed at convincing the public of the truth of an old and now increasingly disputed theory of the scrolls origins
478195 like the recently propagated claim that ossuary coffins found in a jerusalem crypt contain the remains of the family of jesus of nazareth and of jesus himself
478196 based not on scientific research per se but rather on conjecture and a tendentious presentation of evidence techniques feeding on a largely faith based fascination with christian origins
478197 this kind of heated scholarly dispute happens in every scientific field golbs ideas need to be discussed
478198 raise basic questions regarding the scientific conduct of the san diego museum in respect to its forthcoming exhibit of the scrolls
478199 museum is being accused of taking sides in a bitter and widening academic dispute the museums motives for hosting such a biased exhibit are unclear thus its conduct manifestly violates the ethical transparency standard promulgated by the american association of museums
478200 the museum instead of guiding viewers toward an understanding of the controversy over the origin and significance of the scrolls manifestly undertakes to manipulate the laymans comprehension of them
478201 you dont want to confuse people with so many competing theories so they walk away saying well nobody really knows anything
478202 in the usa a country half choked by its own religiosity a dead sea scrolls exhibit has been doing the rounds oddly promoting an old and largely discredited theory about the origin of the scrolls and their authors
478203 celebrities including steven spielberg have contributed considerable sums of money to fund the exhibit and its associated scholars most likely unaware that they were aiding in the dissemination of pseudo archaeology and an unjustified and partisan interpretation of the evidence both textual and archaeological
478204 we believe that evangelical christian scholars should play a significant role in the study of the dead sea scrolls
478205 we appear to be dealing at the very least with an exhibition tainted by intellectual antisemitism with an obscurantist seemingly irrational fear of debate and with biased conduct that is abhorrent to our basic social sentiments and to the principle of freedom of inquiry which lies at the core of our system of values
478206 every conceivable effort appears to have been made to convince readers of the truth or verisimilitude of the qumran sectarian theory
478207 financial gain regardless of the truth or falsehood of the curatorial claims
478208 there is a third reason but i never write it down
478209 the effort here expressed cannot but raise troubling issues regarding the genesis and purpose of this show
478210 faced with more cars than places to park on seattle streets the citys transportation department is considering restricting the number of residential parking permits people can have

478215 faced with more cars than places to park on seattle streets the citys transportation department is considering restricting the number of residential parking permits people can have
478216 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
478217 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
478218 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
478219 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
478220 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
478221 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
478222 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
478223 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
478224 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
478225 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
478226 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
478227 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
478228 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese
478229 we care less about human rights than other countries and more about sovereignty thats bound to create an awkward feeling among other countries
478230 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent

478236 my uncle owed 75 000 rupees 1 800 us dollars to the state bank of india he was already bankrupt he could not have repaid 75 percent all at once to avail of the rebate benefit
478237 the total loan waiver is for 2 ha farmers but thousands of farmers like me have land holdings of five acres or just over 2 ha
478238 i cant repay my loans the land is giving me no income
478239 when the country enacted the land ceiling act it imposed a ceiling of 18 acres on irrigated areas and 54 acres in the dry land areas naturally 30 years later farmers with irrigated land have smaller land holdings than their counterparts in the rain fed areas
478240 that is one reason why thousands of them borrow money from private usurers at exorbitant rates for farm and domestic needs
478241 we were unable to repay debts even today much of that loan remains to be repaid
478242 of the 85 000 rupees 2 125 dollars i owe 15 000 rupees 375 dollars is from the bank the rest is from private sources
478243 over two thirds of vidarbha farmers debts are on non institutional credit
478244 the government has provided relief to sugarcane farmers when the real distress is here
478245 this year chilly prices stand at rs 2500 a quintal down from rs 5000 at least in 2002 03
478246 if a chilly farmer fails to get an average 20 quintals of yield he is set to be doomed the economics would not work out in his favour then
478247 every farmer is in trouble and chilly grower is no different
478248 given the large number of central and state food aid schemes it is hard to understand why the sahariyas the tribe that has been worst hit by hunger and starvation in rajasthan are in the plight theyre in today there are special provisions for the old infirm pregnant and lactating mothers school going children and infants there are food for work programs run by the village panchayat village level government to provide employment even the world bank sponsors a poverty alleviation scheme in the district on paper no one needs to go hungry ground reality is starkly different
478249 wilted under policies aimed at dismantling it part of the doing away with subsides theme
478250 the export price of wheat is even less than the bpl rate of that item in many states india is exporting lakhs hundreds of thousands of tons of rice at rs 5 65 a kg in andhra a government sells rice to people in drought hit regions at rs 6 40 a kg
478251 devise a scheme where no person goes hungry when the granaries are full and lots are being wasted due to non availability of storage space
478252 the chief ministers of the states and myself had gone to the prime minister atal bihari vajpayee seeking central assistance in august this year but instead to acting positively the government is playing politics
478253 we had asked for special assistance for the drought hit states but our pleas went unheeded we shall now take up the matter in parliament
478254 the entire area is under threat of insufficient nutritious food
478255 the cause of death in jahidas case was associated with old age problems however malnutrition was one of the major causes of her suffering i visited the victims village and found that the entire area is under threat of insufficient nutritious food
478256 we dont have proper and sufficient medical equipment and so we have to refer our patients to the district hospital
478257 the patients who have been referred to here are not in condition even to utter a word they have been kept on oxygen but nothing can be said regarding their improvement
478258 another five year old boy also died suffering from the same cause five days ago his stomach was swelled up it was found out that he had been living by eating dirt for many days there had been no cooking in his house
478259 every day someone or the other dies of hunger in the village of dayarampur or among other adjacent villages they have not even heard of annapurna yojana a central government scheme intended to give them food grains when in need one handicapped man named amir shah complained that their names have not even been included in the below poverty line list which would allow them to apply for assistance
478260 women of this locality are fleeing to other places to get work we are looking for options to address this economic crisis hopefully it will work out soon
478261 the hunger in murshidabad district has affected the villagers so badly that a large number have been displaced to other areas looking for means to survive
478262 apart from this fertile agricultural land houses cattle and everything are being ruined and the environmental conditions are worsening
478263 the government is making mockery of basic human rights according to the authorities india is now self sufficient in food grains our country is also sending so many shiploads of grain to different countries affected by natural calamities like the tsunami while our own people are dying for want of food the warehouses of the food corporation of india are full but the people in such circumstances have nothing the west bengal government is letting its people starve in violation of its constitutional obligations and those under international law
478264 the cause of death in jahidas case was associated with old age problems however malnutrition was one of the major causes of her suffering i visited the victims village and found that the entire area is under threat of insufficient nutritious food

478268 there isnt enough time to count the pages let alone read the many documents they push at that time
478269 the suicides however continued unabated and the number increased to 1414 during 2006 07
478270 no evaluation of the implementation of the packages in terms of reduction in agrarian distress was made
478271 self help groups were paid subsidies in excess of admissible norms
478272 while reimbursing banks for interest waived on loans sanction of fresh loans was not ensured
478273 distress amongst farmers on account of cost of education was not measured
478274 the selection of beneficiaries had no relation to the departmental survey conducted for the assessment of distress as a result the prioritisation of relief and rehabilitation works considering the distress level of farmers could not be ensured
478275 authenticity of reported expenditure was doubtful in the absence of proper classification of accounts
478276 the estimates were not realistic as these were made based on the amount allocated to this component and not based on actual requirement
478277 but if you want folic acid you have to walk 50
478278 baba would have been very happy today had he been
478279 in adults a bmi body mass index of 16 and less should be used as a cut off point to demarcate starvation from under nutrition based on a requirement of 0 7 kcal per kg per hour a 50 kg person needs about 850 kcal per day to maintain oneself at basal metabolic rate without any physical activity thus any food intake that is sustainedly lower than 850 kcal per day would be incompatible with life in due course and is an indication of starvation
478280 a person does not have to die to prove that he is starving this insistence on death as a proof to starvation must be given up continuance of a distress situation is enough proof that a person is starving
478281 i took my son mantu to hospital once by ambulance but cannot pay the amount a second time although my son is still suffering
478282 simlipals villages which are inhabited by tribal communities are thus forced to resort to quacks locked inside their leafy green jail they are dying of disease and apathy

478286 i call this the creeping silent crisis in indian agriculture
478287 that you say something about your brother that he dislikes
478288 what if what i say about my brother is true
478289 if what you say is true then you have gossiped about him and if it is not true then you have slandered him
478290 beware of backbiting for backbiting is more serious than adultery a man may commit adultery and drink wine and then repent and allah will forgive him but the backbiter will not be forgiven by allah until his backbitten companion forgives him
478291 indeed truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to heaven and a man continues to tell the truth until he is recorded before allah as a truthful one and indeed lying leads to evil and evil leads to hell and a man continues to lie until he is recorded before allah as a liar bukhari muslim and killing him is a form of unbelief

478302 so we fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal
478303 he is the image of the invisible god the firstborn over all creation
478304 when all the people were being baptized jesus was baptized too and as he was praying heaven was opened and the holy spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove and a voice came from heaven you are my son whom i love with you i am well pleased
478305 for this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to god and that he might make atonement for
478306 may the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the fellowship of the
478307 when the counselor comes whom i will send to you from the father the spirit of truth who goes out from the father he will testify about me
478308 i speak the truth in christ i am not lying my conscience confirms it in the holy spirit

478310 try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of free wills involve and you find that you have excluded life itself
478311 if the whole universe has no meaning we should never have found out that it has no meaning just as if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes we should never know it was dark dark would be without meaning
478312 what does it mean in the image and likeness of god first of all the bible tells us that god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth god is a superior trinity father son and holy spirit man was created an inferior trinity spirit soul and body it is in the realm of the spirit that man meets and can commune with god we are created in the image of god in the spiritual sense gods chief emotional attribute is love so god created us with a capacity to love god has the capacity to reason so he created us with the ability to reason gods chief governing characteristic is self determination so he created us with the capacity of self determination god thinks feels wills speaks so he has created us with the capacity to think feel will and speak
478313 everything is permissible for me but not everything is everything is permissible for me but i will not be mastered by anything
478314 people are afraid of themselves of their own reality their feelings most of all people talk about how great love is but thats b s love hurts feelings are disturbing people are taught that pain is evil and dangerous how can they deal with love if theyre afraid to feel pain is meant to wake us up people try to hide their pain but theyre wrong pain is something to carry like a radio you feel your strength in the experience of pain its all in how you carry it thats what matters pain is a feeling your feelings are a part of you your own reality if you feel ashamed of them and hide them youre letting society destroy your reality you should stand up for your right to feel your pain
478315 i have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts there can be no more hurt only more love
478316 pleasure of love lasts but a moment pain of love lasts a lifetime
478317 all that we are is the result of what we have thought if a man speaks or acts with an evil thought pain follows him if a man speaks or acts with a pure thought happiness follows him like a shadow that never leaves him
478318 god whispers to us in our pleasures speaks in our conscience but shouts in our pains it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world
478319 hell begins on the day when god grants us a clear vision of all that we might have achieved of all the gifts which we have wasted of all that we might have done which we did not do
478320 hell is truth seen too late duty neglected in its season
478321 god created the law of free will and god created the law of cause and effect and he himself will not violate the law we need to be thinking less in terms of what god did and more in terms of whether or not we are following those laws
478322 theres too much tendency to attribute to god the evils that man does of his own free will
478323 one of the annoying things about believing in free will and individual responsibility is the difficulty of finding somebody to blame your problems on and when you do find somebody its remarkable how often his picture turns up on your drivers license

478338 in the place between wakefulness and dreams i found myself in the room there were no distinguishing features save for one wall covered with small index card files they were like the ones in libraries that list titles by author or subject in alphabetical order but these files which stretched from floor to ceiling and seemingly endless in either direction had different headings as i draw near the wall of files the first to catch my attention was one that read girls ive liked i opened it and began flipping through the cards i quickly shut it shocked to realize i recognized the names on each one then without being told i knew exactly where i was this lifeless room with its small files was a crude catalog system for my life and here were written the actions big and small in detail my memory couldnt match with a sense of wonder and curiosity coupled with horror well there stirred within me as i began to open files exploring their contents some brought joy and sweet memories other brought shame and regret so intense i would actually look over my shoulder to see if anybody was watching me the name of one file entitled friends next to it friends ive betrayed the titles ranged from the mundane to the outright weird books ive read lies ive told comfort ive given jokes ive laughed at some were hilarious in their exactness things ive yelled at my brothers others i couldnt laugh at things i did in my anger things i muttered under my breath to my parents i never ceased to be surprised by the contents often there were many more cards than i suspected and sometimes there were fewer than id hoped for i was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of life ive lived could it be possible that i had in my short 20 years written these thousands possibly millions of cards but each card confirmed the truth each was written in my own handwriting each signed with my signature when i pulled out a file called songs ive listened to i realized the files grew to contain their contents yeah the cards were packed tightly and yet after 2 or 3 yards i couldnt find the end of the file i shut it i was somewhat shamed not so much of the quality of the music but more so the vast amount of time i knew that file represented then i came to a file labeled lustful thoughts and i felt a chill run through my body i pulled the file out only an inch not willing to test its size i drew out a card and shuttered at its detailed contents i felt sick to think that such a moment had actually been recorded and suddenly almost as if with animal rage one though dominated my mind no one must ever see these cards no one must ever see this room ive got to destroy them in an insane frenzy i yanked out the file its size didnt matter now i had to empty it and burn all the cards i took the file out at one end and began pounding it on the floor i couldnt dislodge a single card i became desperate i pulled out the card only to find it was as strong as steel when i tried to tear it defeated and utterly helpless i returned the file to its slot leaning my forehead against the wall and i let out a long self pitying sigh and then i saw it a title that bore the name people ive shared the gospel with the handle was brighter than those around it newer almost unused i pulled on its handle and a small box not more than 3 inches fell into my hands i could count the cards that it contained with one hand and then the tears came to my eyes i started to weep sob so deep that they hurt they started at my stomach and shook all the way through me i then fell on my knees and i cried out of shame the overwhelming shame of it all the rows of these filed shelves swirled in my tear filled eyes no one must ever know of this room i must lock it and hide the key but then as i pushed the tears away from my eyes i saw him no no no no no no not here not now anybody but him no it cant be not not jesus i watched helplessly as he began to open the files and read the cards i couldnt bear to watch his response in the moments i could bring myself to look at his face i saw a sorrow deeper than my own he seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes why did he have to read every one finally he turned and he looked at me from across the room he looked at me with pity in his eyes but it was a pity that didnt anger me i dropped my head i covered my face with my hands and i began to cry and he walked over and put his arm around me he couldve said so many things but he didnt say a word he just cried with me and then he got up and he walked back to the wall of files and starting at one end of the room he took out each and every file each and every card one by one and he began to sign his name over mine no i shouted rushing to him all i could say was no no i pulled a card from him his name shouldnt be on these cards but there it was written in red so rich so dark so alive his name jesus covered mine and it was written with his blood he gently took the card back he smiled a sad smile and continued to sign cards and i dont think ill ever understand how he did it so quickly but the next instant seemed like i heard him close the last file and walk back to my side he placed his hand on my shoulder and said hey its finished i stood up and he led me out of the room there was no lock on the door there were only new cards to be written

478352 we didnt believe the same kind of things as boomers it was much harder to fool us
478353 if the gen xers were like no im not in it for the money millennials rebelled against that and are completely greedy
478354 we grew up with courses that dissect the media and advertising so i think were even more aware of whats going on

478370 1 after david had finished talking with saul jonathan became one in spirit with david and he loved him as himself 2 from that day saul kept david with him and did not let him return to his fathers house 3 and jonathan made a covenant with david because he loved him as himself 4 jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to david along with his tunic and even his sword his bow and his belt
478371 16 and sauls son jonathan went to david at horesh and helped him find strength in god
478372 my father saul will not lay a hand on you you will be king over israel and i will be second to you even my father saul knows this
478373 he is my refuge and my fortress my god in whom i trust
478374 and i will ask the father and he will give you another counselor to be with you forever the spirit of truth the world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows him but you know him for he lives with you and will be
478375 for everything there is a season and a time for every matter under heaven
478376 then king david went in and sat before the lord and he said
478377 i was angry with my people i have given them into your hand you showed them no mercy you who say in your heart i am and there is no one else besides me therefore evil shall come upon you and trouble shall fall upon you and desolation shall come upon you suddenly
478378 the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart these o god you will not despise

478381 das war eine sch ne geste vom trainer dass er mich eingewechselt hat ich wollte unbedingt dabei sein
478382 ich war mit dem beginn des spiels wirklich zufrieden da waren wir ziemlich dominant
478383 wir sind weiterhin in der testphase und haben ja auch nicht mit unserer in anf hrungszeichen ersten elf gespielt daf r hat das aber schon sehr gut funktioniert
478384 ich hasse es wenn man den eindruck erweckt man k nne zu schnell zufrieden sein da waren wir nicht konsequent genug da hat es sich geh uft dass der gegner rund um unseren sechzehner frei zum schuss kam
478385 wir waren nach vorne hin gut unterwegs aber die tiefenstaffelung muss bleiben wenn wir mal einen gang rausnehmen stehen wir zu tief das kann man besser machen
478386 in der zweiten halbzeit hat sich die mannschaft noch mal in spiel gebissen wir hatten toll heraus gespielte torm glichkeiten

478388 kuba ist pr destiniert f r diese art fu ball und hat ne klasse vorbereitung gespielt
478389 eine halbe stunde lang war das richtig ordentlich dann haben ein paar k rner gefehlt aber das ist normal f r ihn beginnt die vorbereitung jetzt erst so richtig
478390 f r das erste spiel mag das zutreffen da k nnen nur zwei von drei spielen
478391 doch ich w re froh wenn wir alle drei in einer guten verfassung an die startlinie bringen k nnten weil wir hoffentlich zu viele spiele haben als dass ich da mit zwei oder drei innenverteidigern durchspielen lassen k nnte
478392 ich h tte gerne vier sehr starke innenverteidiger und sehr gerne die qual der wahl
478393 witterungsbedingt war das tempo nicht so hoch wie in unserem spiel der rasen war da sehr stumpf
478394 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical
478395 i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
478396 i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races
478397 i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
478398 what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from what my values are
478399 so what i think has been an approach of the mccain campaign is to say hes risky
478400 they are very good at negative campaigns they are not so good at governing
478401 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama who has opposed every element of john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling affordable nuclear energy and gas tax relief for hardworking families
478402 there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bipartisan group i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions
478403 but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect

478474 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
478475 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
478476 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
478477 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

478532 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
478533 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
478534 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
478535 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
478536 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

478544 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
478545 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

478577 those who helped abetted and actively took part in the bombings were arrested
478578 this is not about khrushchev or stalin its about the future of russia
478579 the reason these rumors persist is rooted in the fate of the country when reformers are considered to be weak and tyrants strong
478580 i dont think khrushchev is of any interest to todays russian government
478581 im convinced leonid was shot down and killed in the war and that he was neither a captive nor collaborator of the germans
478582 stalin asked him to stand up and get a hold of himself
478583 i have said everything in my book there is nothing to add
478584 nothing happens in russia without the support of the government
478585 degrading the honor dignity and good name of khrushchev l n

478587 will you regret it when youre 30 if you dont go
478588 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
478589 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
478590 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
478591 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
478592 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
478593 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
478594 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
478595 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
478596 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
478597 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
478598 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
478599 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
478600 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese
478601 we care less about human rights than other countries and more about sovereignty thats bound to create an awkward feeling among other countries
478602 nel mio deserto di acqua non c la luce per vederti vorrei rubare la luna per poterti illuminare e quando son riuscito ad illuminarti sono rinato la verit esiste solo nei ricordi della mente sono piccole verit che illuminano il mio cammino verit bianche come il domani che apre la finestra al nostro destino come il tuo sguardo quando mi guardi come il tuo ricordo quando non ceri la verit che senza te muoio di pena
478603 answering a question about his approach to combatting crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge as part of his argument mccain praised the crime fighting efforts of former new york mayor rudolph giuliani urban league president marc morial countered that while new york did experience a drop in crime under giuliani there were several major instances of police misconduct to which mccain promised aggressive prosecution of civil rights violations and a justice department free from political cronyism
478604 make sure that the known criminals are kept under control
478605 the use of the military in opposing drug smuggling and illegal immigration was a significant step away from the acts central tenet that there was no proper role for the military in the direct enforcement of the laws
478606 aggressive saturation patrolling ambushes and listening post operations must be conducted
478607 using force precisely and discriminately strengthens the rule of law that needs to be established
478608 national security force as big powerful and well funded as our combined u s
478609 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
478610 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
478611 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
478612 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
478613 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
478614 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
478615 the us may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the us has long denied
478616 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
478617 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
478618 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
478619 a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government has assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
478620 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
478621 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which us intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
478622 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the us and accepted implausible us assurances at face value
478623 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its us allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
478624 it is deplorable that previous us assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of us activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
478625 not available im sure its just some oversight or glitch or something so if you could you tell me where these things are i i have them written down here somewhere oh wait sorry about the smears it was raining out ill just read it to you

478635 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
478636 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
478637 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
478638 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
478639 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
478640 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
478641 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
478642 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
478643 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
478644 i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
478645 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
478646 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
478647 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
478648 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
478649 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
478650 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
478651 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
478652 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
478653 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
478654 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
478655 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
478656 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
478657 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

478668 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
478669 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
478670 a kind of box that consumers reluctantly buy in order to play our games
478671 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
478672 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
478673 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

478679 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
478680 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
478681 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
478682 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

478692 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
478693 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
478694 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
478695 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

478704 what will you do if someone jumps into your shell hole swiftly i pull out my little dagger grasp it fast and bury it in my hand once again under the mud if anyone jumps in here i will go for him stab him clean through the throat so that he cannot call out thats the only way he will be just as frightened as i am then in terror we fall upon another then i must be first
478705 i do not think at all i make no decision i strike madly home and feel only how the body suddenly convulses then becomes limp and collapses when i recover myself my hand is sticky and wet the man gurgles it sounds to me as though he bellows i want to stop his mouth stuff it with earth stab him again he must be quite but i have suddenly become so feeble that i cannot anymore lift my hand against him
478706 at last i am beside him then he opens his eyes he must have heard me for he gazes at me with a look of utter terror the body lies still but in the eyes there is such an extraordinary expression of fright that for a moment i think they have the power enough to carry the body off with them the gurgle has ceased but the eyes cry out yell all the life is gathered together in them the eyes follow me i am powerless to move so long as they are there
478707 i prop the dead man up again so that he lies comfortably i close his eyes they are brown his hair is black and a bit curly at the sides the mouth is full and soft beneath his moustache the nose is slightly arched the skin brownish it is now not so pale as it was before when he was alive for a moment the face seems almost healthy then it collapses suddenly into the strange face of the dead that i have so often seen strange faces all alike
478708 comrade i did not want to kill you if you jumped in here again i would not do it if you would be sensible too but you were only an idea to me before an abstraction that lived in my mind but now for the first time i see you are a man like me i thought of your hand grenades of you bayonet of your rifle now i see your wife and your face and our fellowship forgive me comrade we always see it too late i will write to your wife

478714 it wont be perfect this first preseason game but we have several to get up to speed
478715 the preseason games you dont put a lot of stock in
478716 we want to get the offense going and make everyone comfortable and we want to get the defense established
478717 theyre going to be thrust into a brand new situation and even the veteran players here they dont know what im going to expect on the sidelines
478718 i think its an effective tool having that ability to get the call in in real time
478719 it alleviates some of the time it takes to get a call but they do turn it off 15 seconds before the play clock expires
478720 it is an extra preseason game its probably not the first thing we would choose
478721 one has to play according ot needs of the team not according ot his whims and fancies i would prefer a player who atleast is consistent even though he doesnt score triple hundren rather than this guy who blasts his way to triple hundred and then for the next few innings is useless identify one player in any international team who has such an attitude
478722 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare

478749 it isnt like we havent been here in two or three years we were just here six weeks ago so everybody kind of knows what to expect as far as the track goes
478750 when it clouds up it gains a lot of grip and a lot of speed when the sun breaks out it gets slick and greasy that has a lot to do with the outcome of the race and hopefully it will be just fine
478751 i think we had a pretty good baseline last time here we were pretty happy with our race car so well go back and look at those notes a lot and take what we learned yesterday with the track being a good bit different for us and try to incorporate that all into a best educated guess on what we want
478752 theres always a menu of stuff that we would like to try to improve our car like everyone else
478753 and a lot of these teams have a lot more experience here than us but with the car of tomorrow everybody is trying to build a new catalog of tools in their chest to improve their car for certain things

478759 the fbi must not let the death of bruce ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks
478760 the chance to prove ivinss guilt before a court of law has been lost but the need for a thorough investigation and a full accounting to the american people remains
478761 if ivins was indeed responsible for the attacks did he have any assistance did anyone else at the army lab or elsewhere have any knowledge of his activities prior to during or shortly after the anthrax attacks
478762 it appears increasingly likely that the only significant bioterrorism attack in history may have originated from right within the biodefense program of our own country
478763 the implications for our understanding of the bioterrorism threat and for our entire biodefense strategy and enterprise are potentially profound
478764 its too bad unless we get some unusual levels of precipitation in the early fall we are looking at less than good wetland conditions this fall
478765 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical
478766 i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
478767 i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races
478768 i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
478769 what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from what my values are
478770 so what i think has been an approach of the mccain campaign is to say hes risky
478771 they are very good at negative campaigns they are not so good at governing
478772 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama who has opposed every element of john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling affordable
478773 there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bipartisan group i remain sceptical of some of the drilling provisions
478774 but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect
478775 i am recommending that we step outside of the democratic parameters which were parameters constructed by white technocratic anti european bureaucrats and return to the heroic mode of the antique europeans in that mode political systems were a means to an end and not the end itself

478788 while usurpation of learning and memory processes may support persistent seeking of abused drugs common synaptic mechanisms of natural and drug reinforcement have not been demonstrated
478789 we suggest that neuroadaptations induced specifically by drug self administration may form a powerful memory that can be activated by drug associated cues
478790 future studies are required to identify the exact mechanisms through which drugs of abuse alter neural circuitry that is normally accessed by naturally reinforcing events but is usurped by cocaine to persistently cement these synaptic adaptations perhaps ultimately leading to pathological drug seeking behavior

478817 the kurds want to lay bricks for an independent state but escalating tensions will not bring any good to anyone
478818 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
478819 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
478820 well thought out drilling strategies that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage
478821 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
478822 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
478823 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things they dont like thats something im open to
478824 sen obama says he wants energy independence but he doesnt support anything that serves that goal
478825 he believes every domestic energy source has a problem i believe every energy source needs to be part of the solution
478826 we need oil drilling and we need it now we need it offshore
478827 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore drilling
478828 the long term trend is for flat or decreasing oil supply and increased consumption
478829 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of good here
478830 i dont want partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
478831 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional offshore drilling is wrong

478856 when you lose weight youve created about the perfect storm for regaining weight
478857 areas of your brain involved in telling you not to eat seem to be less active you are more responsive to food and you are less in control of it

478866 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
478867 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
478868 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
478869 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it

478881 we struggled a bit with the balance but in the end i was able to make the harder tyre compound work very well and here we are i am now looking forward to the race

478900 man kann nicht verlangen dass die rennleitung eine solche entscheidung ad hoc trifft zumal solche dinge selten eindeutig sind
478901 das sind ja zeitr ume von drei vier minuten in denen die rennleitung den blick au erdem immer noch auf der strecke haben muss
478902 du bist der sieger des vergangenen jahres hier bist der gewinner der vergangenen zwei rennen was denkst du vor dem morgigen rennen
478903 ich habe sicherlich das gef hl dass wir uns in einer guten position befinden wir haben dieses wochenende gro artige arbeit geleistet und haben das auto im verlauf der vergangenen wochen verbessert ich bin aufgrund der entwicklungen die sie vorgenommen haben auf das team sehr sehr stolz
478904 es herrscht eine gro artige atmosph re und eine gute harmonie innerhalb des teams hier stehen wir wir haben uns auf den pl tzen eins und zwei qualifiziert dies bringt uns meiner meinung nach in eine gro artige position um um den sieg zu k mpfen ich habe jedoch keinerlei zweifel dass es morgen ein hartes rennen werden wird
478905 zu beginn des wochenendes schienst du probleme im dritten sektor zu haben wie hart hast du daran gearbeitet
478906 dies war nat rlich wirklich der schw chste punkt w hrend des wochenendes gewesen aber ich denke dass ich dies heute morgen in den griff bekam und es danach nicht wirklich ein problem war ich war dennoch nicht der schnellste im dritten sektor ich denke jedoch dass ich im ersten sektor die schnellste zeit fuhr und ich war bis zu diesem punkt schneller
478907 ich habe also definitiv dort verbesserungen vorgenommen was gut ist und ich habe immer noch den ersten und zweiten sektor behalten es war jedoch meiner meinung nach im dritten sektor hart dieses tempo zu halten
478908 was ist mit dem super weichen reifen welche leistung hat dieser mit schwereren tanks gezeigt
478909 um ehrlich zu sein sind sich beide reifen sehr hnlich es war einfach so dass wir uns dazu entschieden den h rteren reifen zu verwenden da wir das gef hl hatten dass es aufgrund der hei en bedingungen und dem schwereren tank wom glich besser sein w rde auf beiden fuhren wir im ersten und zweiten qualifying teil sehr hnliche zeiten aber ich pers nlich hatte einfach das gef hl dass der h rtere reifen ber die runde hinweg ein wenig st rker war ich traf aus diesem grund die entscheidung ihn zu behalten
478910 wenn man berlegt wo du nach dem rennen in frankreich gestanden bist ist es f r dich dann eine berraschung wie sich das blatt gewendet hat und wie dominant du nun in den vergangenen paar wochen gewesen bist
478911 nicht wirklich ich verstehe nicht warum dies eine berraschung sein sollte wie ich schon immer sagte hatten wir ein paar dumme rennen aber wir hatten auch in montr al eine gro artige geschwindigkeit und sogar in magny cours waren wir noch schnell es ist also keine berraschung es gibt keine wunder wir arbeiten einfach sehr hart und erzielen gute fortschritte
478912 ich frage mich ob du dich jemals so stark und entspannt in einem formel 1 auto gef hlt hast so wie du es im moment tust
478913 beide stuten haben gen gend kondition f r diese strecke und sie kommen auf jedem boden zurecht
478914 wir menschen im norden sind aber bekannt f r unsere hohe toleranz
478915 in sachen metallica habe ich bisher nur mit lars ulrich etwas billigen wein getrunken und ein wenig nett geplaudert

478918 mijn vriendin irma coacht mij dat kan ze heel goed
478919 theres problems in america with safe neighborhoods as we well know
478920 and some of those tactics you mention the war in iraq are like that we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement etc etc
478921 100 american soldiers with three blackhawk helicopters and two apache gunships overhead
478922 are neighborhoods in baghdad where you and i could walk through those neighborhoods today
478923 theres problems in america with safe neighborhoods as we well know
478924 im not making that comparison because its much more deadly in iraq obviously
478925 just like anyopen air market in indiana in the summertime
478926 the idea of free speech the idea of being told what you can and cant say is just so foreign to australians that someone would monitor your email and tell you what you can write about or not write about
478927 now we know from our own research and contacts in china theres over 63 thousand cases where falun gong practitioners have been tortured for their beliefs
478928 lucky in some respects but also just like its so wrong that should it be more open everywhere
478929 it wouldnt be surprising we are well aware that the government bring all sorts of pressure to bear and in the new world of the new china that pressure can often be business pressure as much as it can be inter governmental pressure it wouldnt be in any way surprising to learn that that kind of pressure had been applied to have the signal cut
478930 si no pasa nada antes del 31 de agosto me quedar aqu
478931 la oferta del madrid por van der vaart es una broma
478932 fichar a van der vaart depende de ellos si el real madrid ofreciera 16 millones por cristiano ronaldo la gente se reir a lo mismo ocurre con lo que ofrecen por rafael es como una broma
478933 en los ltimos d as han habido muchos rumores y problemas por eso ha sido mejor no alinear al jugador en estos momentos
478934 todo el mundo sabe nuestra posici n sobre el jugador y lo que hemos dicho todav a sigo pensando que formar parte del equipo la pr xima semana llevamos semanas hablando de van der vaart necesitamos una explicaci n final
478935 en los ltimos d as me he dado cuenta de que supone un problema si el jugador no est al cien por cien porque no puedo dejarle jugar y formar parte del equipo
478936 a grand salon a throwback to new york of old

478938 in your recent valleywag article are you implying that steve westly is doing something wrong by promoting alternative energy solutions in the bay area
478939 what were the odds that florida was going to be within a thousandth of one percent
478940 its going to be close enough that a tie is definitely possible if its close its possible it becomes closer to 2 percent
478941 new mexico tends to mirror the national polls so when you see a national poll showing obama up 4 to 6 points thats a pretty good indicator
478942 the question is can obama resonate among hispanic democrats and rural democrats can he be seen as a regular guy
478943 if you go to a supermarket here theres a decent chance an obama worker is going to ask you to register to vote i think obama has a lead but i wouldnt bet a lot of money on it
478944 its something to almost prepare for and think through because it would really be a disaster
478945 i have become a symbol of restoring america to its best traditions
478946 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
478947 i know how this works you people have to pin this on somebody and that person doesnt have to be guilty
478948 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
478949 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
478950 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
478951 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
478952 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
478953 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
478954 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
478955 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
478956 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
478957 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
478958 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
478959 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
478960 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
478961 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
478962 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace
478963 the greatest act of political courage that i have ever witnessed
478964 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
478965 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
478966 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
478967 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
478968 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
478969 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
478970 i guarantee you if id have showed up there and theyd have said you cant come in just by yourself and with your maybe a senate one of your staff id have gone nuts i would have called the secretary of defense and said secretary gates i want to visit these people instead apparently sen obama decided to go to the gym at the ritz
478971 even with higher fares we would not find ourselves out of the sales tax hole that were in so which is going to be very very significant until the economy turns around
478972 act on their own in ways that are not in convergence
478973 we need to identify these people and weed them out
478974 the effects of the bad crash of tour didnt go away during the race i had bad feelings when the street became tough when the effort was deep i felt the symptoms i had already felt during the long trainings that are respiratory problems and headache
478975 the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a simple question
478976 if we want to create jobs we should do more to make work pay for ordinary americans
478977 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
478978 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
478979 but we have to do more than just provide short term relief
478980 we have to secure our long term prosperity and strengthen americas competitiveness in the 21st century
478981 i was watching tv and noticed an informercial for cure all vitamin supplement with a unique map background
478982 so the eco challenge guest judge natalie portman is a good style icon i think the interesting thing about natalie first off in todays world to find the balance of someone whos stylish and very chic and very smart all at a young age and able to really express herself about everything including fashion i thought she was really a fabulous addition to our pantheon of guest judges and plus particularly in that instance to talk about eco fashion which i think for her is very very personal but shes one of those girls she doesnt want to give up being stylish so she wants the best of both worlds so i think she was really a great addition and i think that is something that i as a designer and everyone as designers right now is dealing with how do we construct something that is dealing with eco friendly fabrics without it making you look like johnny appleseed
478983 para iniciarse en el mundo de la web 2 0 y no es mas que

478985 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
478986 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
478987 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
478988 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
478989 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
478990 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
478991 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
478992 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
478993 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
478994 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
478995 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
478996 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
478997 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
478998 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
478999 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
479000 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
479001 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
479002 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
479003 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
479004 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
479005 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
479006 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
479007 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
479008 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
479009 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
479010 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
479011 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
479012 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
479013 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
479014 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom

479021 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
479022 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
479023 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
479024 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
479025 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
479026 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
479027 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
479028 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
479029 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
479030 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
479031 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
479032 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
479033 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
479034 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
479035 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
479036 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
479037 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
479038 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge

479042 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
479043 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars

479078 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
479079 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
479080 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
479081 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
479082 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys

479085 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
479086 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
479087 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
479088 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
479089 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
479090 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
479091 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
479092 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
479093 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
479094 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
479095 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately

479101 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
479102 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him

479106 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
479107 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
479108 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
479109 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
479110 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
479111 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
479112 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
479113 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
479114 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
479115 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
479116 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
479117 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
479118 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
479119 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
479120 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
479121 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
479122 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
479123 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
479124 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
479125 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
479126 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
479127 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
479128 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
479129 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
479130 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
479131 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
479132 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
479133 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
479134 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
479135 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
479136 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
479137 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
479138 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
479139 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
479140 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
479141 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
479142 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
479143 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
479144 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
479145 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
479146 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
479147 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
479148 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
479149 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
479150 when they write the textbook on how you fight back there will be a chapter exclusively for plunderbund
479151 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
479152 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
479153 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
479154 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
479155 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
479156 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
479157 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
479158 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
479159 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
479160 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
479161 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
479162 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
479163 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
479164 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
479165 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
479166 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
479167 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
479168 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
479169 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
479170 where to live and play now the 50 next great towns
479171 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
479172 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
479173 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
479174 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
479175 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
479176 frankly its original design was all about the control of the wii wand but there are other ways to implement that it is a hugely innovative product i expect youll see it on other platforms in time
479177 qu buen senado tendr amos si tuvi ramos buenas autoridades
479178 eventually our plans are for the achievement system to become an account based system
479179 its basically a gamerscore for now the points are just a wow character score as we graduate to that blizzard account system which is right on the horizon it will switch over to a blizzard level
479180 your wow score would be just one factor that will go into your blizzard level and rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games youll have this blizzard identity and youll be able to see things like oh this guy was great at diablo iii but he never played starcraft and he was mediocre in wow that sort of thing
479181 you could design a game where the ps3 would be the superior platform but youd have to go out of your way to do it
479182 if youre doing a game like people just want to do games now the 360s the better platform
479183 when we were looking at publishers there were only a handful and we were really excited by the leadership john riccitiello flew to mesquite to talk to us and he is more of a gamer than i think people realise
479184 the questions that he asked and frank gibeau david demartini those guys run the most powerful publisher in the world and theyre all hardcore games they were excited about the title and we felt that ea would be the best partner for us and it wasnt about money
479185 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
479186 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
479187 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
479188 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
479189 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
479190 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
479191 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
479192 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
479193 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
479194 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
479195 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
479196 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
479197 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
479198 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
479199 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
479200 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
479201 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
479202 wouldn t be discussing a rumored pregnancy in this interview
479203 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
479204 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
479205 to me its encouraging that women are aware of and understand their risks and they are concerned about the right things
479206 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
479207 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
479208 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
479209 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
479210 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
479211 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
479212 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
479213 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
479214 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
479215 you know its not about you its about your country
479216 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
479217 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
479218 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
479219 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
479220 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
479221 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
479222 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
479223 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
479224 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
479225 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
479226 everybodys trying to figure out how to lower levels of acrylamide without significantly adversely affecting taste
479227 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
479228 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
479229 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
479230 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
479231 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
479232 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
479233 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
479234 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
479235 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
479236 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
479237 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent
479238 police chief shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
479239 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
479240 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
479241 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
479242 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
479243 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
479244 we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision
479245 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
479246 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
479247 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
479248 he wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that although it created a lot of anxiety for him and in fact he stayed because of family matters
479249 he stayed for his father who he is extremely close to and for his whole environment therefore he was unable to create that split that they expected and we were hoping for
479250 mourinho did hope for this move but we knew it was going to be difficult
479251 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
479252 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
479253 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
479254 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
479255 one of the most common situations for young children to experience anxiety comes at the transition period between leaving home and attending childcare or school
479256 remember your child is only young once apprehension and anxiety about school will typically pass after your child develops a comfortable routine
479257 there came a wind oot o the north a sharp wind and a snell and a dead sleep came over me and frae my horse i fell the queen of fairies she was there and took me to hersel and never would i tire janet in fairyland to dwell but aye at every seven years they pay the teind to hell and though the queen macks much o me i fear twill be mysel

479260 we didnt buy the fallout franchise to just do fallout 3 and then stop but lets get this one out of the door before we worry about the next one
479261 if you have the pc as your lead machine you have the problem of not knowing what configurations people have how many gigs of ram or what graphics card they have
479262 obviously we are more familiar with the xbox because we are familiar and the other thing is that the xbox is much easier to take to tech shows we can just pop the hard drive off the xbox and put it on any machine which is an advantage taking the pc or ps3 to these things just isnt convenient
479263 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
479264 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
479265 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
479266 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
479267 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
479268 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
479269 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
479270 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
479271 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
479272 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
479273 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
479274 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
479275 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
479276 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
479277 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
479278 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
479279 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
479280 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
479281 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
479282 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
479283 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
479284 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
479285 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
479286 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
479287 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
479288 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
479289 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
479290 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
479291 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
479292 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
479293 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
479294 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
479295 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
479296 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
479297 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
479298 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
479299 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
479300 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
479301 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
479302 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
479303 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
479304 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
479305 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years
479306 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
479307 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
479308 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
479309 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
479310 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
479311 genetic tests could have great benefits in the early detection of disease tendencies but there are detrimental effects too
479312 saving money for a government or private health system is one criterion for using a genetic test but certainly not the only one
479313 it would be a waste of time and money and could cause side effects or anxiety if a perfectly healthy person was unnecessarily given a drug for say high blood pressure its just the same for genetic tests
479314 it is essential to work out who if anyone can benefit from a particular test before the test is made freely available
479315 it is not acceptable for companies and other organizations to offer genetic screening to everyone in the population
479316 the bones are made up of the foods you eat so theyre a direct measure of diet
479317 my take on this is this is why neanderthals were extinct while modern humans were much more successful
479318 they were eating some vegetables and fruits but it was not enough to show up in their bone chemistry
479319 i feed him on a special diet of chicken fish and beef he eats about a pound 0 45 kilograms of meat a day and racing biscuits which are mixed with vegetable stock
479320 we really wanted to run the race over 100 meters 109 yards
479321 sydney harbor is a unique place it has a much higher diversity than any harbor in the world
479322 sydney siders love the harbor but from the water surface down they have this concept that its just mud and car tires but its actually quite a diverse beautiful place
479323 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
479324 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
479325 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
479326 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
479327 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
479328 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
479329 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
479330 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
479331 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
479332 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
479333 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
479334 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
479335 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese
479336 we care less about human rights than other countries and more about sovereignty thats bound to create an awkward feeling among other countries
479337 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
479338 i think they are cynical i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
479339 the one thing we know about the team that john mccains assembled because its a carryover from some of the folks that worked on bush campaigns and some of the republican campaigns in the past is that theyre very good at negative campaigns theyre not so good at governing
479340 we dont take the skill of the republicans in engaging in negative attacks lightly we think its something that weve got to be mindful of but what we also have confidence in is that the american people feel that were offering real solutions
479341 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama who has opposed every element of john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling affordable nuclear energy and gas tax relief for hardworking families
479342 i dont know that theres that perception thats something thats being fed to the media by them i get no sense that its taken
479343 i think what would be useful is to ask the question whats this based on its not really clear exactly what its based on
479344 if i was presumptuous or taking this for granted i wouldnt be working this hard this week im beat
479345 they must understand that sacrifices are inevitable they must understand the whos the whys the whens the whats the wheres and whos standing with you not whos standing behind you because sometimes people standing behind you disappear when you look back
479346 courage is the discovery that you may not win and trying when you know you can lose
479347 the team have done a great job in improving the car again even from the last race and so the pace of our car is great and i think it is a great day to have me and heikki one two i think it is about time we did that for the team it is very satisfying you know we were quickest throughout testing yesterday and then also today q2 looked a bit close but i think it was just tyre dependent we made the right choice at the end so i am very very happy
479348 it was the safer option to use the harder tyre
479349 it doesn t seem to grain as much as the softer tyre so it worked out really well for me i think there was a little bit of time lost in the second sector of my lap but i was still very very happy with it i have got a little bit of time to get still the car was great i think heikki was quicker than me in the last sector so he is pushing me hard but that s good
479350 the car has been feeling strong the last few races and i think as lewis said we have been improving since the last test and all the way through the weekend more and more the package so it was just a matter of nailing it in qualifying it was difficult to choose the right tyre i was planning to use the softer one with the heavier fuel load in the last part of qualifying but we changed our mind when everyone else went quick with the harder tyre i think we are going to see a circuit evolving towards the end of the race it is going to get grippier and grippier and the off line is going to get dirtier so we just can t put the wheel off the line that is going to be crucial tomorrow
479351 i went a little bit at the wrong time on the track and there were so many cars around most of the people were very very slow on the out lap and that for sure especially in my case as i like to go slightly quicker but i cannot pass them so that s really tricky for the preparations of the tyres and i couldn t prepare the tyres like i am supposed to and i couldn t do a great lap
479352 i was just able to get the best out of the car and the car just had great balance unfortunately it doesn t count for much it just counts for the next qualifying anyway i m still confident for sure i m going to do my best tomorrow to gain some positions
479353 i made a mistake on my final flying lap which cost me precious time and that followed on from not having got a great lap on my previous attempt which explains why i m sixth
479354 of course i am not happy and starting from the third row my race will be an uphill struggle i will try and make the most of this situation given that the car today was not that bad we are going through a bit of a difficult time but we mustn t give up all we need to do is put together all the pieces of the jigsaw and then the results will come to us again
479355 the car has been quite difficult to drive over the entire weekend
479356 we struggled a bit with the balance but in the end i was able to make the harder tyre compound work very well and here we are
479357 on my last lap in q1 i had four cars in my way
479358 most of them at least tried to give me room but it still cost me time towards the end of the lap i had one car in front which was on an out lap he saw me and accelerated he then overtook sebastien bourdais before the last corner and then sebastien was right in my way
479359 it wasnt easy today because we had a very tight choice over tyres
479360 so we had to make a close decision for every lap but in the end my engineers stayed cool and got it right in q2 the car felt perfect then on the very last lap it was a bit trickier again because the tyres didnt behave quite as well but im happy with p5 we are in a great situation for tomorrow
479361 since this morning i have struggled for grip and balance and unfortunately we werent able to find the answers in time
479362 im happy for timo who has done a good job this weekend and it is clearly important for us overtaking is very difficult here
479363 we knew that the qualifying session would be very close and that proved to be the case
479364 we managed to reach q3 with both cars which is positive but i think the race tomorrow will be difficult that s for sure
479365 it would have been nice to have had a bit more pace in q3 but q2 and q1 went well for us
479366 i m disappointed i m on the wrong side of the grid an odd number is always better but we definitely have a chance to get something from where we are so we ll see how we go tomorrow
479367 it was a shame to miss out on q3 by one hundredth of a second
479368 we can be happy though especially given i only managed nine laps yesterday we did a good job today ive yet to do a long run this weekend but i think we can find a good compromise between qualifying and race pace and we have a good set up on the car
479369 weve definitely made some progress with the new developments to the car and in particular the new rear suspension is working well
479370 this has enabled us to improve the car step by step over the weekend i got the most out of the car today and its encouraging to see we were only three tenths away from the top 10 as it has been a while since we were that close
479371 i felt the super soft option tyre was working slightly better with the car so i stayed with that for my final run
479372 i went in too quick for turn 11 and made a mistake which ruined my lap with that went the chance to progress to q2
479373 i made a mistake on my fast lap in q1 and lost two and a half tenths in one corner so my q1 time did not show the true potential of our car we then had a good chance of making it into q3 but a hydraulic problem meant i couldnt go out at all in q2 which was disappointing
479374 we now need to go through the data and work out whats happening in order to get the most out of the car for tomorrow
479375 the balance was not too bad but unfortunately the grip level is still very poor
479376 i think were not particularly quick round here and we have to accept that but we are still quite close to the others
479377 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
479378 i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
479379 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
479380 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
479381 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war
479382 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
479383 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
479384 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
479385 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
479386 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
479387 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
479388 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
479389 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
479390 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
479391 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
479392 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
479393 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
479394 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
479395 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
479396 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
479397 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
479398 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
479399 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
479400 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
479401 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
479402 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
479403 bend over and give the ladies a thrill and some of the guys too this is san francisco after all
479404 thats why it was so important that we didnt stop until we brought somebody who could do something like this off the streets
479405 who would want to hurt a two year old kid ive got grandchildren that age or younger i just wouldnt want anybody doing that to my child
479406 david craft was first and foremost a friend and was truly an outstanding principal a great teacher a great educator he was well respected by everyone that knew him he made a tremendous difference in the lives of children as well as adults his influence will live on in the lives of countless numbers of people who worked for him or who were his students
479407 fichar a van der vaart depende de ellos si el real madrid ofreciera 16 millones por cristiano ronaldo la gente se reir a lo mismo ocurre con lo que ofrecen por rafael es como una broma
479408 en los ltimos d as han habido muchos rumores y problemas por eso ha sido mejor no alinear al jugador en estos momentos

479412 quiz llegue algo la pr xima semana el madrid debe pagar lo que deseamos si no no habr nada
479413 hes just basically standing on the side of the roadway and at certain times hes crossing the roadway
479414 were addressing that issue not only as an enforcement stand but also as an educational stand because we just want to draw attention to the issue

479419 estamos pasando por un momento complicado pero no debemos rendirnos todo lo que necesitamos es colocar las piezas del puzzle y los resultados volver n a estar de nuestra parte
479420 la carrera ser dif cil pero intentar aprovechar la situaci n e intentar conseguir el mejor resultado posible

479427 damaging the marine preserves was assumed by the preserve advocates
479428 i can assure you that nothing will be done to impact negatively on the preserves
479429 we are drafting a substitute bill as a result of the hearing which will make it clear that the marine preserves will be retained while at the same time accommodating some limited fishing by indigenous fishermen when the department of agriculture opens a preserve forregulated fishing
479430 at least when the kids come back to school theyll be cool
479431 we want to make this place a little bit better than it was
479432 i think were going to be able to make it
479433 im famous and you can be too if you just worship me
479434 any conduct that brings or is likely to bring discredit to the profession
479435 teachers are being singled out and police do too to a certain extent it really raises the question of what is your private life and should that be something thats judged by the public
479436 im a petrol head i own some powerful cars and go into closed sessions and take my car off road now am i a hoon when and how might that be judged
479437 how you behave and who you interact with is that of public concern
479438 teaching is one of the most regulated professions there is and we do have our own code of ethics here is another quality control on good character at some point where does common sense come in and the right to a private life where do you draw the line
479439 is it out of character to go out and have a good time at night lots of young teachers do head to town especially the single ones private lives cant be held over our heads and personally i feel it is going to far
479440 professionals do use discretion as does everyone in the public eye
479441 as long as its not injurious to public health i dont see a problem
479442 the more you increase accountability the more you make the profession undesirable
479443 very often that is a decision that can be made based on someones background
479444 there are interest groups around who are always concerned about cleaning up the teaching profession often they have a very strong religious background to them there may well be active attempts by groups to identify individuals
479445 we are practically on show all the time theres not many professions that are fingered quite like that
479446 it is very much a big brother approach and low trust model we are constantly under scrutiny
479447 what is improper conduct for a teacher is it the same as what it is for a plumber it needs to be defined
479448 well be watching all of the cases that come through
479449 any conduct that brings or is likely to bring discredit to the profession
479450 teachers are being singled out and police do too to a certain extent it really raises the question of what is your private life and should that be something thats judged by the public
479451 im a petrol head i own some powerful cars and go into closed sessions and take my car off road now am i a hoon when and how might that be judged
479452 how you behave and who you interact with is that of public concern
479453 teaching is one of the most regulated professions there is and we do have our own code of ethics here is another quality control on good character at some point where does common sense come in and the right to a private life where do you draw the line
479454 is it out of character to go out and have a good time at night lots of young teachers do head to town especially the single ones private lives cant be held over our heads and personally i feel it is going to far
479455 professionals do use discretion as does everyone in the public eye
479456 as long as its not injurious to public health i dont see a problem
479457 the more you increase accountability the more you make the profession undesirable
479458 very often that is a decision that can be made based on someones background
479459 there are interest groups around who are always concerned about cleaning up the teaching profession often they have a very strong religious background to them there may well be active attempts by groups to identify individuals
479460 we are practically on show all the time theres not many professions that are fingered quite like that
479461 it is very much a big brother approach and low trust model we are constantly under scrutiny
479462 what is improper conduct for a teacher is it the same as what it is for a plumber it needs to be defined
479463 well be watching all of the cases that come through
479464 which retailer is going to offer the best prices for the things students need most is how consumers are entering the back to school marketplace
479465 hes working so if he wants something he can buy it himself
479466 with all the prices going up i can really use the money
479467 buy what the student will actually need not what you think they will need
479468 talk to your childs teacher to determine if there are ways to cut costs for supplies particularly if the teacher lists specific products to be purchased
479469 what happens when you take children shopping they want something extra more extravagant or just bug you until you give in on something you were not shopping for
479470 before you know it you have spent a bundle of money you didnt expect to
479471 if you really watch the ads most stores start selling crayons glue etc for close to pennies
479472 i usually get all my school supplies for both boys not including lunch boxes and backpacks for under 20 by just watching the sales
479473 some of the items with great deals are in limited quantities so the new lesson is to go the day the sale starts
479474 my children go through glue sticks and i would rather have a supply at home that only cost me 15 cents in the fall instead of purchasing more in january when the prices goes back to 1 each
479475 i start adding office depot and staples to my list for stores to check each sunday starting in late july
479476 were looking at some of the supplies they had last year and checking if some of them are reusable
479477 then the ones we have to buy we buy on sale
479478 my son needed a zippered binder which can cost upwards of 10 12 i got his on clearance last summer for only 5
479479 i think any legislation that decreases the amount a taxpayer has to pay is good
479480 i will continue to work with navy officials to ensure that a thorough review of this matter is undertaken and that steps to address the underlying cause of the leak are implemented
479481 we want all the facts to be known so that we can ensure that there has been no harm to the residents of guam danger to the crew or damage to the environment
479482 we need to take it seriously its up to our leaders to do something about it
479483 i have been informed that the amount of leakage was at a negligible level but i remain concerned about this news
479484 at no time was there a risk to the houstons reactor plant the safety of the crew or the safety of the public
479485 the facility can detect radiation at the most minute levels
479486 the results i think will be very definitive and very clear and we expect full cooperation from the navy
479487 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
479488 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
479489 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
479490 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
479491 talk about legends bob dylan wrote and recorded so many meaningful historic songs
479492 bob had a good jump shot and some pretty good moves but when he tried driving past me for a lay up the canadian ice hockey player in me came out i dumped him on his ass with a ticky tack foul
479493 i was really starstruck jack too bleep ing cool for his own good nicholson i said jack i saw the last detail and you were wonderful
479494 he stared at me as if to say you bleep ing idiot is that all you can say is this why you exist to bug the hell out of us celebrities who just want to be left alone to drink snort coke and bleep adoring fans why dont you get out of my face and let me continue on my way forgetting that we ever met ok my pot high evaporated i vowed that when i got as famous as jack i would never disrespect my fans
479495 while the cdcs new report may demonstrate improved national hiv surveillance we have plenty of work ahead turning this data into something we can use to reduce new infections across the u s
479496 to make measurable progress against hiv we need to know whether infection rates are going up which groups are becoming infected and which prevention activities reduce new infections we need a comprehensive national aids strategy with measurable outcome targets a timeline for action increased funding and a particular focus on those most at risk including racial and ethnic minorities
479497 hiv aids continues to be a public health emergency that has not received adequate nor appropriate attention as a nationwide priority
479498 it is ironic that the cdc is announcing these long awaited figures at the international aids conference where we are hearing success stories from countries implementing vibrant national aids strategies as a major requirement for receiving u s funds via pepfar
479499 the cdcs nearly two year delay in disclosing these figures from 2006 exacerbates continued peril to the countrys most at risk communities including african americans and latinos who bear the brunt of the epidemic
479500 also recent evidence of rising hiv diagnoses among gay men and other men who have sex with men especially among young gay men of color is a clear example of why a new approach is desperately needed to obtain progress against hiv aids in the u s
479501 only with increased resources and a cogent and well implemented national aids strategy can we bring down hiv incidence increase access to care and reduce persistent racial and ethnic disparities in the hiv aids epidemic
479502 a comprehensive outcomes oriented strategy is the best way to ensure provision of evidence based programming including needle exchange programs and comprehensive sex education for youth
479503 the revised cdc figure represents an unacceptable level of new hiv infections for a preventable disease the revised estimate underlines the need for a national aids strategy with measurable outcomes reliance on evidence based programs and sufficient funding
479504 stopping the spread of hiv and treating all people living with hiv must be a high priority for our leaders and the american public
479505 this is not just another set of statistics there are people behind these numbers people are becoming infected with a disease that is preventable we know how to prevent hiv but we have been fighting this epidemic with one hand tied behind our back reflecting a disturbing dismissal of hiv prevention as a public health priority
479506 the new higher estimate is yet one more wake up call to our national leaders that they need to do more starting with developing and implementing a real national aids strategy
479507 i dont know if its a good or bad thing because i know what to expect
479508 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means

479510 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
479511 my space used to be around here he said gesturing to a space in front of his body and people werent allowed in it
479512 there was anxiety this week that websites that were reasonable to be opened for the games reporting were closed
479513 we addressed the issue quickly with bocog the organizing committee and these sites are now being opened
479514 wherever you go in the world youll always get censorship in some form
479515 whats important is that censorship doesnt impede the justifiable grounds for internet access for reporting the games im saying this because now were moving in that direction
479516 theres certainly no anxiety about beijings venue construction or infrastructure improvement
479517 readiness to work in a cooperative way with the international olympic community
479518 over the seven years that weve been working together weve always been able to get results that were both comfortable with
479519 it did not belong in the olympics i do not feel that was the place to make a stand every time something has come up since then the munich massacre of the 1972 olympics and the boycott of the 1980 olympics i think that has something to do with it the olympics should mean pure sport
479520 smith did what he thought was best for the sport forty years later were coming to see who tommie smith is and his great contribution to the world i have a high regard for who he is and what hes tried to do for the sport
479521 there was so much racial unrest that was going on in our country at that time martin luther king had been assassinated robert f kennedy had been assassinated it seemed like the hopes for the future were dark this was something that was brought to our attention and they started a process and then good things started to happen it took a lot of courage they were ridiculed and ostracized its only now theyre getting their just due
479522 maybe it wasnt the best way to make a statement but i support them what it caused was for people to look at what was going on forty years later its much better
479523 i truly believed they had a voice and they used it but their livelihood should have been much greater they felt as if they had no other means i applaud them and im happy that they did what they did
479524 the most important thing is the end result of what happened on the victory stand
479525 its just a shame that we have to be in a public feud about who did what and why
479526 it was viewed immediately as two athletes defying the flag defying the pride of being who we are
479527 and for tommie smith that never was the case i was there because i had thought it was necessary to make a stand against what we were going through in my country
479528 was really a culmination of what was happening in our history as a nation in a lot of ways
479529 because they were giving voice to people who had no
479530 the race dont mean shit to me i talked to tommie about making a statement after the race and he agreed when he agreed to assist me the race became secondary i knew how much the gold medal meant to tommie and i wanted to see his dream come true i felt that a silver medal would be fine with me as long as i get a chance to make a statement
479531 basically hes in denial i believe he believes what he says thats the sad thing it gives credence to a very stupid thing it doesnt make him look good hes supposed to be a competitor i really like the guy but as long as he keeps separating us by saying things like that i cant agree with him and i can only talk to him so much because im the one hes talking negatively about
479532 its another thing he has because of being on that victory stand with me
479533 i didnt really feel that mr smith would do that thing on the podium had he not won that gold medal
479534 thats the main and sole reason why i had to go
479535 to do what i felt necessary to try to bring attention to people about not just black america but the plight of this world in which we live
479536 totally against the idea of a smith and carlos separation because of the need to be socially acknowledged
479537 we are people with difference of opinion of the same thing which comes to the same end which is social equity
479538 i cant believe this youre sitting here and saying this this is insulting john i like you too much for this stuff to happen
479539 its more like theyre brothers who have had a terrible fight
479540 all of us would much prefer they were friends and political comrades who had forged a bond of love out of the shared experience but in a weird way its almost deeper than that
479541 i think a lot of americans still dont understand that for a white guy to stand up for black america in 1968 wasnt the coolest thing to do
479542 they had every chance in the world to say that wasnt it true
479543 tommie and john keep getting all these humanitarian awards they get doctorates they get statues
479544 but what about the guy in the middle that came second hes the one thats missing out
479545 i love these guys to death and i consider them family
479546 but the fact that theyre actually now fighting i think they need to seriously take a look at their position in the world and their responsibility in the world
479547 realize they can make a serious contribution to making this a better world
479548 were probably at an all time high in terms of athlete activism
479549 i have a lot of pain and agony about it
479550 the creative person wants to be a know it all
479551 i was with my friend in mexico and we saw a light moving over the highway it jumped all over the sky
479552 we started beeping our horns and flashing our lights and suddenly it jumped around 60km closer
479553 we raced back to the city it started following us
479554 even my wife doesnt believe me so why should anyone else
479555 cada pueblo ser libre a su modo y disfrutar de soberan a seg n la voluntad de su conciencia
479556 es l cito y honroso aborrecer la violencia y predicar contra ella mientras haya modo visible y racional de obtener sin violencia la justicia indispensable al bienestar del hombre pero cuando se est convencido que por la diferencia inevitable de los caracteres por los intereses irreconciliables y distintos por la diversidad hondo como la mar de mente pol tica y aspiraciones no hay modo pac fico suficiente para obtener siquiera derechos m nimos en un pueblo donde estalla ya en nueva plenitud la capacidad sofocada o es ciego el que sostiene contra la verdad hirviente el modo pac fico o es desleal a su pueblo el que no lo ve y se empe a en proclamarlo
479557 estar sin dudas la perseverancia y la coherencia de manuel marulanda y sus fuerzas armadas revolucionarias
479558 hacer frente a las armas de uribe las del imperialismo la difamaci n incluso la indiferencia y prurito democr tico de gran parte de la izquierda ahora que tomar un fusil para liberar a un pueblo resulta anacr nico
479559 no est lejos el momento aquel que le brindemos todos juntos el verdadero homenaje a tirofijo
479560 la lucha de clases incluye tambi n la insurrecci n
479561 en un momento donde toda la izquierda org nica le huye a las armas como si el olor a p lvora no combinara bien con estos tiempos
479562 no hay mejor medio de alcanzar la libertad que luchar por ella
479563 no se trata de desear xitos al agredido hay que correr su misma suerte acompa arlo a la victoria o a la muerte
479564 some of you have some thoughts youd like to share about yesterdays sketch on the premature presidency of barack obama
479565 ive decided to approach todays chat as a wine writer would today i am inaugurating the whine enthusiast in which i will rate your whines
479566 g a ve british prime minister gordon brown some management advice over the weekend
479567 this column incorrectly said that sen barack obama shared his views on how to avoid micromanagement with british prime minister gordon brown last saturday obama shared those views with british opposition leader david cameron
479568 inside according to a witness he told the house members this is the moment
479569 milbank cited the quote in support of his thesis that obama was becoming a
479570 i do wonder whether or not echoing a rovian talking point complete with misquote is really your best starting point
479571 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
479572 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
479573 now the old king is dead long live the king
479574 success is many things to many people but to every child of god it ultimately will be to inherit his presence and there be comfortable with him
479575 im flattered such an excellent writer links to my stuff
479576 dont do the crime if you cant do the time
479577 i liked starting because the game was pretty much in my hands the whole time now its fun to be a reliever and come into the big situations
479578 sean has continued to progress over the last month and being able to go deeper in the game hes responded well
479579 he continues to grow and continues to do what weve asked of him
479580 in the last month to month and a half it has clicked
479581 if i get the sinker and slider for strikes pitching is pretty fun
479582 you never wanted to see marte leave because he is such a good arm to have in the bullpen
479583 but with him leaving hopefully it will open up some more opportunities for me and get me in some games where the game is on the line or its a pressure situation its fun to pitch in those situations i like the competitive part of it
479584 this is the first time in my life ive been able to enjoy a summer with my family and friends since high school i guess im looking forward to bigger and better things im having fun its a little different a little bit of a transition but thats natural
479585 its not like i was fired in the middle of the offseason where you have time
479586 youre used to getting up and getting after it every day and competing you adjust and you focus on the positive things you realize how fortunate and blessed you are as a human being
479587 i dont necessarily rush home and turn the tv on if my girls and my wife are watching on tv ill watch it im looking forward to moving past all of that to where its not an essential part of my life im just a regular dude
479588 theres a lot of people that i really have a great affection for david wright and damion easley and marlon anderson and those guys
479589 aaron heilman those are my guys theres a big part of me and thats my team i led that team back to where it is today so you dont just let that go obviously i want them to do well because thats the team i lived and died with for the last three years
479590 i was fortunate enough to have a job with the mets and i came there for a reason that was to help them win the world championship all that other stuff doesnt really matter its about reaching goals and winning championships
479591 this is still to me one of the most special places in baseball
479592 i grew up here i learned my chops here i learned how to be a winner here the memories i could sit here all day every time i walk in this place its special it gives me goose bumps to reminisce and reflect on some of the experiences ive had here

479596 in light of a number of factors surrounding the february 2009 show we are encouraging prospective exhibitors to submit applications as close to the first review date as possible
479597 we anticipate filling more quickly than usual as a result of the date change of the baltimore show a reduction of space in the exhibit hall due to construction and the introduction of the new two year february contract
479598 weve been steadily writing orders since the show opened this morning
479599 new and returning exhibitors are indicating first day sales that are higher than expected
479600 traffic on the floor has been steady and buyers report that they are ready to write orders for the upcoming holiday season
479601 if you did nothing wrong you have nothing to worry about
479602 we dont put the hardware and software on hotels if there is a targeted individual that seems to be a likely prospect of terrorists they must go through the fisa court and ask for a court to determine that there is probable cause to be able to listen in on that information this is a blanket requirement of a hotel to operate a license in china it is non specific to anybody it can be used on journalists it can be used on athletes or excuse me theyre at the olympic village but on their families it can be used on democracy advocates human rights advocates none of which is prohibited it is real time i think there is a huge difference between these two that are taking place

479619 sporadic and isolated cases of social cleansing first appeared in latin america in the early 1980s
479620 the utility of police brutality in the elites war against the poor
479621 across latin america the political agenda and dinner debates among the elites and middle classes are dominated by how to combat rising crime and by anxiety about personal safety
479622 in brazil death squad members are often the military police who for a price deal with the problem in a quick and efficient way
479623 the same pattern is repeated farther south in argentina a 50 minute ride away from the elegant tree lined boulevards of central buenos aires the working class neighborhood of don toruato has been the scene of well documented murders of suspected delinquents carried out by the don toruato death squad since 2000 this death squad led by off duty police sergeants has sold security to the neighboring middle classes that has involved cleansing the area of undesirables in exchange for a monthly salary these undesirables are often targeted because they are considered bad for business local businesses feel street dwellers devalue an area and put off potential customers
479624 these self declared guardians of morality have set themselves the task of stamping out any socially deviant behavior that blemishes society
479625 the practice of targeting people of a different sexual orientation is perhaps most similar to persecuting people for their ideological and theological beliefs victims who are unprepared to subscribe to the dominant ideology and theology in latin america persecuting undesirables was a common tool of government control and state political repression used to uphold the u s backed dictatorships of the 1960s and 1970s for example the military juntas that overthrew the socialist leaning goulert government in brazil and the allende government in chile coup deetats supported by conservative christians in the united states bloody merciless coups that beverley lahaye of concerned women of america has referred to as miracles of god authoritarian regimes developed national security doctrines that involved the military protecting the state against internal ideological and theological enemies
479626 ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
479627 but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also
479628 and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also

479633 bush claims to be a christian and not only that he claims that it is precisely his christianity that has propelled him into politics bush explains
479634 one of these decisions that people might not like but one that bush and his business cohorts and banker friends feel is the
479635 now stop for a moment and take notice of whats being said here note the clever way bush intermingles moral failure and words that connote unethical lifestyles i e crime prisons blame etc with
479636 how convenient for the rich and it goes a long way in justifying the harsh changes in the bankruptcy laws that bush has proposed changes that have the potential of reducing a great portion of our population to a condition approaching indentured servitude to companies like visa master card american express and banks like wells fargo bank of america citicorp chase etc
479637 woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation
479638 a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven
479639 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
479640 for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out

479651 i was stunned and i said to him you shot an unarmed man behind barbed wire for throwing a stone he said well i knelt down i said a prayer stood up and gunned them all down there was a complete disconnect between what he had done and his own morality

479653 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
479654 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim

479656 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
479657 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
479658 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
479659 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
479660 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
479661 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
479662 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
479663 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
479664 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
479665 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
479666 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
479667 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
479668 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people
479669 be the change that you want to see in the world
479670 i wizbang fly guy celebrity wizbang cant technorati britney pop dr who with dr anymore
479671 i am a circus performer and for years i have been embarrassed to pass gas on stage people in the audience sometime thinks its part of the act but it isnt because of your wonderful product today my audience laughs at my gags and not my gas

479673 sometimes a parent will say how about i pay you 5 000 and you potty train for me
479674 second the same goes for the econometric studies by the best labor economists regarding the effects of the influx of unskilled illegal immigrants into the us the latest study by george borjas and larry katz of harvard also shows a virtually negligible impact on workers wages once necessary adjustments are made
479675 footloose immigrants is obviously going to have a different assimilation profile than the more permanent type of immigrant a different type of economic impact and it fundamentally changes the nature of the
479676 a new nimbler breed of immigrant aided by discount airfares and technology can hopscotch across countries to capitalize on economic cycles
479677 blogging is nice and fun but it has a sizable opportunity cost at this point every hour spent blogging is an hour not spent at working on my research projects or finishing my manuscript
479678 since 2004 when the european union added eight eastern european countries hundreds of thousands of eastern europeans have moved west mostly to ireland and the united kingdom among the first eu countries to open their borders to workers from the new members now with the western economies flirting with recession and eastern europe flourishing the wave of immigrants is slowing sharply many of the recent arrivals half of them by some estimates are heading home
479679 the shift shows how rapidly some eastern european economies are catching up to their western counterparts as their growth wages and currencies surge
479680 this involves the great question as to the right of expatriation upon which so much has been said in this cause perhaps it is not necessary it should be explicitly decided on this occasion but i shall freely express my sentiments on the subject that a man ought not to be a slave that he should not be confined against his will to a particular spot because he happened to draw his first breath upon it that he should not be compelled to continue in a society to which he is accidentally attached when he can better his situation elsewhere much less when he must starve in one country and may live comfortably in another are positions which i hold as strongly as any man and they are such as most nations in the world appear clearly to recognize
479681 just you wait indictments for the higher ups are coming down
479682 wouldnt a policy that merely compensates those who suffer from immigration while also allowing anyone who desires to become and american to do so be more closely aligned with our core national values of human liberty
479683 thats a simple externality problem one pretty easy way to solve externality problems is by requiring beneficiaries to pay the sufferers
479684 your assumption is that without some limitations on immigration too many people will come here although i would expect that more might come than currently do i see no theoretical reason to believe that any more will come than there is work for that labor markets will clear and the surplus will look for work elsewhere in the world
479685 immigrants can be charged a one time fee to cover the present value of their estimated cost
479686 welfare or other subsidies from the rich to the poor or from the federal government to localities deemed to bear higher costs like the hud cdbg program can be increased to account for the presumed costs to affected parties
479687 however thats just a way to force concerns about something other than economics into an economic framework in other words money isnt everything
479688 i challenge you to find evidence to back up your assumption that open borders means america will be overflooded by immigrants
479689 money isnt everything but it provides a useful tangible parameter with which to estimate relative values
479690 at least on this blog its all about the economics framework
479691 at least on this blog trust me you wont stand a chance with this issue analytically in another framework
479692 thats why al gore advocates for carbon emissions markets as a way of reflecting the value of environmental damage for example
479693 thats within the range of what immigrants are currently pay and it would go toward low income americans rather than coyotes
479694 smokers pay fees which are redistributed to other social or health related projects
479695 if a tomato farm in the midwest needs a worker but the cost to education systems in california are affected negatively by a liberal immigration policy its reasonable to ask the farmer to pay 10 000 the the fed government who uses it to pay for grants to california
479696 while dr borjas brings up a few good arguments against the rationale that there are also not good economic reasons to open borders thats not the same thing as an argument for expending community resources to restrict immigration
479697 which path is most beneficial for the pre existing population of the country importing low skill immigrants or building robots
479698 look at the state of new mexico most of the folks of mexican descent who are there have lived there more than 150 years and after 150 years they are on average still quite poor
479699 a 1966 article in the new york times accurately described the organization as an
479700 u s immigrants stories often are about reinvention and newfound prosperity about leaving behind poverty and limitations
479701 both magdaleno and anzaldo are illegal immigrants settled for years in an immigrant enclave magdaleno has the same number of children as her parents who were peasant farmers in mexico like her parents she is living in poverty and struggling to provide for her family
479702 neither magdaleno nor her husband speaks english though she has been in the united states 22 years and he 28 even her teenage daughters speak mostly spanish their english vocabulary is limited
479703 yet all of magdalenos 10 children are u s citizens the triplets receive subsidized school lunches all the youngsters have had their healthcare bills covered by medi cal the state and federal healthcare program for the poor
479704 alfredo jr had been hospitalized all his life until recently hes had three state funded brain operations and will require several more the family said the couple receive 700 in monthly social security payments to help with his medical needs
479705 i thank this country that they gave me medi cal magdaleno said theres nothing like that in mexico
479706 any history of a national consensus to preserve any sort of ethnic identity
479707 the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset
479708 whites are seen as the progenitors of all evil their chief sin being an uncontrollable racism
479709 neither any policy nor any history of a national consensus to preserve any sort of ethnic identity
479710 i would like to have wishful thinking and say yes only time will tell
479711 maintain a friendship and who knows what will happen when we get older

479740 responses to some questions regarding certain aspects of the doctrine on the church
479741 because these churches although separated have true sacraments and above all because of the apostolic succession the priesthood and the eucharist by means of which they remain linked to us by very close bonds they merit the title of
479742 it is through the celebration of the eucharist of the lord in each of these churches that the church of god is built up and grows in stature
479743 in a brief document the vaticans doctrinal congregation reaffirmed that the catholic church is the one true church even if elements of truth can be found in separated churches and communities
479744 even in the churches most dominated by liberalism there are fresh troops appearing the battle is clearly joined now more than ever it is necessary to redouble the irds efforts beginning in 2001 we will emphasize training conservatives and moderates for the debates on marriage and human sexuality we intend to conduct invitation only training seminars covering biblical theological scientific psychological and sociological aspects of human sexuality it has proven most effective for the ird to organize recruit members and conduct fund raising through denomination based programs within key mainline denominations the ird conducts the following organizing and training of church activists

479752 i dont like that some people are born with a silver spoon in their mouth and are able to do whatever they damn well please because of some sort of fortune its shameful we allow this to go on
479753 i have seen the university systematically erode diversity by driving out people of colour and the poor and replace it with a aterile conformity of white upper middle class students and faculty

479756 the biggest reward we could receive is to see a psychopath like yourself behind bars
479757 you cant run a government and you cant run a company or anything like that unless everybody is on side
479758 if they are not on side he should kick them out and then what he should do is tell the rest of the world that he has been appointed to do a job for two years and let me get on with it and then at the end of that period of time judge me then
479759 its very easy for people to blame the top man when things are no good but what you have to look deeper are is what these problems are
479760 its not just recently that i have backed gordon brown
479761 ive known him for a long time as chancellor and i have got to know him quite well and out of the last four prime ministers that i have had the pleasure to have met i think he is a very very clever man and a man who is over everything and knows what is going on

479779 probably this model is what a russian consumer needs at the moment
479780 there is a sense of gloom hanging over domestic producers in the first 10 months of 2007 avtovazs russian sales amounted to 542 500 units up just 2 2 percent year on year
479781 in 2007 russias car density stood at 228 per 1 000 adults which is little more than a third of the western european level rising affluence will see russia catching up
479782 in other developed countries this market is growing at best only slightly each year the current economic conditions characterized by high oil prices and the credit crunch do not facilitate global automotive market development
479783 the emergence of a powerful components industry for foreign brands
479784 fast growth in the transparent and civilized sales of used cars through dealerships
479785 i shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence two roads diverged in a wood and i i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference
479786 having a problem with a teacher or the schools discipline rules
479787 refusing to begin working on homework in class saying i only do home work at home merely an amusing comment by a bright student who has a way with words

479789 if we had known about this immediately we would have solved the problem and corrected our childs behavior in a cooperative and mutually satisfactory manner
479790 highlighted gross mistakes in the organization and rules of the school that will have teachers and administrators thinking twice about their systems obvious failures
479791 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
479792 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

479794 snoop dogg and the band appreciate the professionalism displayed by the texas troopers thursday afternoon
479795 the tour bus was stopped for what was thought to be expired tags upon further investigation it was determined the bus was current on its registration and was eventually allowed to continue to snoop doggs show in dallas
479796 the alleged offense a class b misdemeanour was listed as less than two ounces of marijuana the young men arrested dont appear to have prior criminal records i expect that once everything has run its course there will be a favorable resolution to this case the routine stop was otherwise uneventful later in the evening snoop dogg and the band entertained a great crowd in dallas as they performed with 311 as part of the unity tour
479797 malicious beauty va eit prosjekt me holdt p med i nokre r og da ha vore med pao og forma meg til dan musikaren eg e i dag heilt klart da va jo ein meir riffbasert stil enn ke eg driv med i dag men musikalsk sett so va ikkje forskjellen so stor med tanke p kva eg driv p med i feigd engasjementet i bandet var d rleg p slutten so eg blei lei og hadde lyst pr va noko nytt dermed kontakta eg odne spurde om han va interessert i og starta eit nytt band slik vart sigtyr skipa
479798 eg fekk ein god erfaring med sigtyr dei ra eg va med der plukka opp litt andre element bruk av melodiar og synth kom meir p bana enn tidlegare odne og eg hadde jo litt forskjellige m tar og skrive l tar p eg hadde ein litt meir riffbakgrunn enn odne so eg tok for meg den meir brutale delen i lydbildet v rt han tok seg av dei meir dystre elementa og samarbeidet oss i mellom fungerte ganske bra men da va artig og operera som eit heilt band ogs etter kvart du faor ein heilt annan fyldigheit i lydbildet og ein heilt annan atmosf re i vingslokalet enn n r da e berre 2 3 medlemmar i bandet
479799 da so skjedde i sigtyr etterkvart va jo da att med gjekk i litt anna retning n r det gjaldt musikken eg hadde jo ein annan bakgrunn enn odne p riffronten som sagt eg ville ha ein meir thrasha stil i musikken da passa ikkje heilt inn med da odne laga elde konseptet me hadde so me vart einige om g eigne vegar dar me begge fekk utfolda oss med musikken ingen sure miner me skilte lag som gode vener odne e ein av dei f rste so faor h yra da nya eg laga og omvendt
479800 greia e dan at eg ha ein litt meir riffbasert stil i forh nd ti odne eg kalla da berre ein meir thrasha stil i og med at da e meir riffbasert stil yve musikken min eg syns sj l da e element i musikken so ligg i slektskap med thrash metal men so du seier da ligg kanskje ikkje i h gsetet
479801 da ha med dauen og gjera self lgeleg he he dauen e vel noko som opptek dei fleste av oss da skjer rundt oss heile tida ein heilt naturleg del av livet da e ein dyster tanke eg meina da passa godt inn i konseptet mitt musikk og lyrikk inneheld mykje dysterheit m rke stemningar og tankar so difor fann eg ut at feigd va eit passande bandnavn og ingen hadde brukt noko lignande navn f r
479802 n r eg fyst starta nytt band so fann eg ut at eg ville skifta navn ogs ingen spesiell grunn eigentleg tenkte eg ville bruka jan fordi eg ville skilla meg litt ut fr resten av bm scena

479811 tekstane dreier seg ofte om krig og alt muleg anna fanskap skriver mykje om dauen slike ting mykje dystert og dramatisk innhald da kler musikken bra syns eg
479812 tekstane er viktige kontra musikken men da kjem an p l ten nokre l tar inneheld djupare eller meir personleg tekstmateriale mens andre tekstar bli litt meir overfladiske eller meir generelle men n r l ten er klar so skriv eg teksten etter kva stemning eg faor ut av l ten
479813 windir e jo eit band som eg ha stor respekt for terje r i p va ein konge p storsl tte stemningar i musikken sin og da ha inspirert meg ein god del men eg pr ver og skapa ein eigen vri p stemningsbiten eg lika og utfordra meg sj lv med og ta i bruk andre metallelement slik som god gamal thrash metall og dan slags eg syns da e bra at andre band ogs fortset utvikla dan stilen windir starta da e definitivt ikkje ein svakheit
479814 eg e 100 prosent forn yd med resultatet p demoen ellers hadde eg ikkje gitt dan ut hehe kan ikkje seia at da e noko eg e misforn yd med men da faor bli opp til andre og bed mme kva dei er forn yd misforn yd med uansett tek eg ti meg all kritikk
479815 nei eg tek til meg all konstruktiv kritikk reflektera i gjennom dei tilbakemeldingane eg faor da kan gi meg nye idear i l t skrivinga men da resultera ikkje i da at eg forandra l ten l tane men da kan vera ting du kanskje kan bli bedre p ting du ikkje ha teinkt yve eller h yre sj lv

479838 el orden justo de la sociedad y del estado es una tarea principal de la pol tica
479839 la justicia es el objeto y por tanto tambi n la medida intr nseca de toda pol tica la pol tica es m s que una simple t cnica para determinar los ordenamientos p blicos su origen y su meta est n precisamente en la justicia y sta es de naturaleza tica
479840 la solidaridad confiere particular relieve a la intr nseca sociabilidad de la persona humana a la igualdad de todos en dignidad y derechos al camino com n de los hombres y de los pueblos hacia una unidad cada vez m s convencida
479841 el t rmino solidaridad expresa en s ntesis la exigencia de reconocer en el conjunto de los v nculos que unen a los hombres y a los grupos sociales entre s el espacio ofrecido a la libertad humana para ocuparse del crecimiento com n compartido por todos
479842 considerar a la persona humana como fundamento y fin de la comunidad pol tica significa trabajar ante todo por el reconocimiento y el respeto de su dignidad mediante la tutela y la promoci n de los derechos fundamentales e inalienables del hombre

479854 he stood out we threw a tight end option route where laron ran over the corner and that as a big play for us he has great size hes blocking hes doing those things you dont come in and teach a freshman to do that its just natural

479862 it would be very cruel to say that what we have ended up with is a twilight home in east belfast for retired gunmen but are relations today between the communities really that different
479863 im just not convinced that the outcome we do have is any better than what we wouldve had had the march not went ahead
479864 the thought that this would lead to a re emergence of militant irish nationalism which would in turn bring about the resurgence of militant loyalism would simply never even have occurred to us

479878 one thing that should not be allowed is the glorification in song or story of what was mean and nasty and dirty
479879 there is always the risk of the re emergence of a cyclical pattern as a generation of young people who have not experienced the actuality the horror and the cost of violence react against the ineffectiveness of politics and politicians their predecessors having been persuaded to turn away from violence on the promise that politics could deliver

479900 we as a club have an asset and it is a delicate balancing act between trying to satisfy the demands of the player and also trying to satisfy the demands of the football club
479901 we had a good talk yesterday there was a little bit of interest last week and the chances are he will be gone by next week i am 60 40 convinced that he will be gone
479902 the offer was a firm one but we have no need to sell anyone and im not going to give anyone away
479903 it has to be a realistic bid in terms of market valuation and bear in mind that 12 months ago he was coming off the back of playing two games for england against brazil and germany
479904 i dont feel disposed to let him go for nothing i appreciate it is a year on from that particular moment but as yet the valuation is not what we find acceptable
479905 two bob is miles away as far as i am concerned if it is not meeting the valuation then it is a long way away
479906 i have been fairly fair with shorsey and he accepts the situation so clarity would be best for everybody
479907 we are in that ridiculous situation that if nobody comes in for him then he will still be here
479908 i would dearly love him to be playing for us as he is a significant player for us
479909 so there are about three balls up in the air for us and it is unsatisfactory for him for us and for everybody
479910 unfortunately the ruling didnt go for us and myself and everybody else at the football club are massively disappointed
479911 i believe rudolph is going to be an exceptional player so to have worked 18 months trying to get him is disappointing
479912 he is obviously upset by it but he is a great lad and he will make sure it doesnt affect him
479913 we are looking down all the avenues to see what the next step is but i am disappointed the ruling hasnt gone for us

479969 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
479970 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
479971 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
479972 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
