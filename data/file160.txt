1600003 in our highly competitive market time is of the essence with new product offerings
1600004 and thanks to the excellent training and support we received from snell amp wilcox our directors were able to get up to speed very quickly on the new system
1600005 the key today when introducing any new technology is to make sure you leave plenty of room for people to be creative with the kahuna our directors are thinking outside the box and doing things that simply werent possible before such as animated effects on transitions
1600006 as pressures accelerate for broadcasters such as wave 3 to make the transition to hd the kahuna is becoming a powerful ally by enabling them to repurpose their archival sd footage
1600007 also as wave 3 has acknowledged the kahuna adds value right away without requiring an extensive learning curve or specialized staff the result is faster time to broadcast and a true competitive edge
1600008 a close race down to the wire only one winner thanks i accept
1600009 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
1600010 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place
1600011 raise whatever he needs for his defense as any mother in this room would do
1600012 david knows he needs to have a big radio hit and mileys producers are the closest thing he can get to a guarantee
1600013 dnf controls usp panels make it easy for our directors to control the status of microphones during production of our newscasts
1600014 the usp is a clean professional grade product that stands up to the rigors of the live production environment it saved us the trouble of building our own solution and every day gives our staff a high level of confidence in managing and monitoring microphone activity
1600015 the usp is made to do exactly what we want and its programmable buttons have given us just the functionality we need
1600016 its clear that dnf controls did its homework in developing and building the usp weve been pleased with the performance of our units and with the support weve received from dnf controls
1600017 we can look at this as a rate increase or we can say that in the past they were undervaluing these mortgages the effect is the same
1600018 with the taxpayers bailing them out fannies loan pricing needs to reflect reality
1600019 it was amazing being down in new orleans and seeing all the philadelphia fans and the amazing outfits they wore
1600020 and were you at the parade that was wild this is a hard core group of fans and these owners really connect with their fans
1600021 their appeal is immense to people who cant afford a season ticket to the eagles
1600022 i hear its going to be the national football league
1600023 yes bert bell used to have his office in bala cynwyd but pete roselle moved it to new york in 1960 and weve been here since
1600024 the decline in second quarter gross margins when compared with the same period in 2007 resulted from increasing raw material and energy costs across our business lines and production issues that are being addressed
1600025 after mtv came along people were seeing their favorite singers in videos and suddenly there was a certain vision of a song how it should sound how it should look then in concert there was no room for improvisation everyone wanted an exact replica
1600026 they dont speak they dont talk to their audience they may say hello new york or hello las vegas in the beginning and thank you in between songs but they dont talk they dont tell stories or take the time to make a connection build a rapport theres no emotion
1600027 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1600028 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1600029 the inflation fight probably will have to wait until 2009
1600030 conditions at this point do not seem to dictate an immediate tightening
1600031 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1600032 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1600033 a larger drop could be in store if oil prices drop even more
1600034 were trying to build a large presence online as more and more of our customers look to the web for entertainment and content daily candy fits right into that strategy
1600035 the last time you had a plant delivered to your door was at 2 in the morning and it wasnt exactly on par with the law
1600036 they are very afraid of losing their jobs normally they are very ill informed about their rights
1600037 most safety posters you can find them in spanish but its harder to find other languages
1600038 we dump it in the main trash can but condoms and maxi pads stick in the can how about if you get sick you dont know what made you sick
1600039 i know how difficult it is to convince them that it is their right to be safe
1600040 the problem is that the senior players were having problems with the coach whom they felt was too harsh to them and after the weekends defeat they said they would not report for training
1600041 so we had to sacrifice lloyd and it was a difficult decision so we will now try to concentrate on fighting relegation and solomon kaseke will be in charge for the rest of the season assisted by goalkeepers coach ndawana dube
1600042 and we hope we will not encounter the same problems because kaseke worked with most of these players at shabanie and triangle
1600043 they are trying to get the value they think is reasonably in its various parts
1600044 the common market is a new frontier for locally grown because its targeting the institutions and some of the other things that just havent been as convenient
1600045 i cant go to philadelphia with my truck and make 15 stops with two or three items that i might grow
1600046 it was a trial for them and a trial for us
1600047 we had to tell people this is really what a fresh local tomato looks like
1600048 i want to prove to our growers that this idea makes sense
1600049 the only problem is that my feet hurt i spent seven days on that mountain it was hard it was terrible
1600050 the board remains confident that the turnaround strategy will deliver sustainable long term growth and is therefore maintaining its investment in programming
1600051 i know he really wants to go and i feel so bad saying this because i really get along with him
1600052 he doesnt let me kat and rachel sing he just hates our singing and he goes on about it all the time
1600053 hes been putting pressure on all of us to nominate him and to me he shouldnt be doing that

1600058 ungeachtet der tatsache dass ich immer positiv ber die olympischen ideale gesprochen nie zu einem boykott aufgerufen oder sportler aufgefordert habe gegen ioc regeln zu versto en wurde der visa antrag weniger als 24 stunden vor meinem geplanten reiseantritt abgelehnt
1600059 die verweigerung meines antrages ist ein teil des systematischen vorgehens der chinesischen regierung um sportler einzusch chtern die sich f r die unschuldigen menschen in darfur einsetzen

1600065 auch wenn die geschworenen nicht zu unseren gunsten entschieden haben sind wir weiterhin der ansicht dass die atp dem hamburger turnier den masters status zu unrecht entzogen hat und wir diese entscheidung zurecht angefochten haben
1600066 das traditionsturnier am hamburger rothenbaum war schon immer ein turnier der h chsten kategorie und der masters status ist uns zeitlich unbegrenzt zuerkannt worden solange wir die regularien der atp erf llen m sste dieser statuts jedes jahr erneuert werden

1600068 fortgesetzte anzeichen eines wirtschaftlichen abschwungs des us markts und in anderen industriestaaten begrenzen den lverbrauch in diesen l ndern
1600069 wir befinden uns inmitten der us hurrikan saison die zeitweise das angebot im herbst vermindern k nnte

1600073 during the whole implementation period we had very close and valuable collaboration from omnibus as we worked out the design of the workflows
1600074 the ability to tailor the g3 desktop to create task specific interfaces meant that our users found the system very user friendly and were eager to switch over to the new tools features like the ability to display scheduled records on a timeline basis add up to a significant improvement in functionality and ease of use
1600075 apart from greatly increasing the efficiency of our workflows this method of transfer also delivers much higher image quality
1600076 the spectrum hd system had the functionality we needed in particular the automatic internal up and down conversion that bridges the gap between sd and hd allowing us to live in both worlds
1600077 but just as important as the functionality is the reliability and robustness of the equipment the on time delivery and the excellent support from omneon
1600078 broadcasters like four points need flexible approaches to accommodate both sd and hd ingest and playout
1600079 in addition to format bit rate and resolution considerations broadcasters are making their technology purchases with an eye toward balancing existing investments and long term strategy with our combined broadcast know how and it expertise omneon delivers media servers that help meet business exigencies because they support all major formats and adapt and scale to fit the evolving hd landscape
1600080 we have an excellent track record with the osprey 530 cards and cctv com chose them for streaming the olympics not only because of their reliability and high performance but also their ability to encode content in different formats for a variety of mobile devices simultaneously
1600081 the 2008 olympic games have been nicknamed the broadband olympics and with good reason
1600082 since the cctv com audience is so huge one of the worlds largest tv viewing audiences were pleased with the role viewcast is playing to deliver all the action to such a significant percentage of viewers
1600083 were looking at trying to eliminate time and distance barriers
1600084 when we surveyed potential students their desire was for more flexible options and more distance learning options
1600085 we need to wait but it could be one week
1600086 it was another good work out it was a good game with four goals for us and good play
1600087 but the players arent 100 per cent yet that would be difficult right now
1600088 the other team were fitter than us but you could see we were passing pressing and the understanding between the players was better i am really pleased with the result
1600089 ich habe ausf hrlich mit ruud gesprochen und will und kann nichts anderes als seinen beschluss zu respektieren
1600090 wir haben einen maestro gewollt aber er hat sich nicht einmal als dirigent erwiesen
1600091 bei uns laufen drei wettbewerbe parallel hoffentlich die gesamte saison ber das wird kein selbstl ufer sondern sehr viel arbeit aber wir werden die herausforderung annehmen
1600092 die anderen mannschaften werden alles tun um es uns so schwer wie m glich zu machen ich hoffe wir werden dem anspruch gerecht ich werde alles daf r tun aber es wird eine lange schwierige saison der dfb pokal ist eine ganz andere kiste da kann schon ein spiel entscheiden
1600093 wir wollen uns in der champions league mit den besten in europa messen
1600094 unsere aufgabe ist es nun lukas zu helfen den n chsten schritt nach vorne zu machen sodass er sich auf vereinsniveau der internationalen spitze n hert das er es kann hat er in der nationalmannschaft gezeigt

1600098 the stream software with digital rapids broadcast manager also provides a reliable and flexible way for us to control manage and monitor our live streaming
1600099 we are very excited to be working with cctv com to deliver live coverage of the olympics to their audience in china
1600100 the exceptional visual quality and reliability of our solutions make them perfect for live streaming applications of this scale and importance and we look forward to continuing to work with cctv com beyond the beijing games on their future projects

1600110 for the very first time im able to create superheroes in the fantastic japanese manga style thanks to my lucky partnership with the great hiroyuki takei what a kick itll be to join hiroyuki san in offering brand new action packed stories to an army of readers in both the eastern and western worlds
1600111 word of ultimos development and subsequent debut in japan led many domestic fans to wonder when they would get a chance to read it so were very excited to offer the north american debut in the upcoming september issue of shonen jump
1600112 ultimo was developed as a true collaboration with stan lee sending his initial story idea to takei san who developed artwork and characters and reworked the plot to fit into the japanese manga storytelling style the result is something extremely compelling and we invite everyone to check out this historic release in our upcoming issue

1600116 masterpiece that shows the true potential of anime as an international art form
1600117 if youre looking for a unique anime with some real heart then definitely give this one a shot
1600118 theres really no way you can go wrong with this release
1600119 no i dont joey galloway is still not ready to go b j askew is still not ready to go ill say jeff garcia and jovan haye are making progress but theyre still not ready to go charles bennett left practice with some heat and hydration problems i believe hell be ok other than that i really dont have any other updates antonio bryant made his return today and was somewhat limited but he gutted it out its a credit to him
1600120 well luke mccown had both of them we dont get out here early every day all year and get center quarterback exchanges for any other reason thats the no 1 fundamental in this game at this point in time its ridiculous
1600121 i saw some improvement the guys are practicing hard its very competitive every time the defense stuffs the offense you want to be mad if youre an offensive coach when we get a big explosive play offensively you want to be mad if youre a defensive coach but when you go back to your room to look at the tape theres some very good things that we can build off of
1600122 im doing well its a grind putting together the scripts putting together the rotations what we worked on today we worked on the four minute drill where the offense has a lead and youve got to make a first down running the ball normally to close out the football game we were successful once and unsuccessful another time we worked on the last three plays of the game in desperation with our backup players that could possibly be in that role against the dolphins you try to be creative to stimulate your players and also challenge them its been fun in some regard its also been a lot of late nights and early mornings you get a little tired but im going to live when im alive and sleep when im dead as bon jovi says
1600123 he looks good he runs effortlessly hes making the effort to become a more reliable blocker hes a rare target throwing the football to him hes got great receiving ability and we like the things hes doing
1600124 warrick looks good to me warrick is picking it up he understands the offense hes more comfortable hes moving very quick and instinctively and im really impressed with warrick dunn
1600125 he can watch and be a spectator at this point hopefully in the next 48 hours hell be able to get back on the practice field in some capacity whether it be in a walkthrough or in individual work hes not far away but these injuries youve got to be careful with you dont want to have a setback hes making real good progress
1600126 well hand out a game plan so to speak were not really specifically looking at the dolphin defense theyre going to run a 3 4 defense theyve got a new defensive staff there were going to try to continue to challenge our players learning our offense and well put together and introduce the miami dolphins to our players so our players are familiar with their personnel and their scheme but were not going to spend countless hours game planning for the regular season we never do
1600127 i see a lot of what i saw last year in the second half of the season i see a guy that not only can rush the passer and has speed to get the corner but hes also becoming a much more complete player were running the ball left in our 9 on 7 drills more than we ever had just to try to get him ready for the regular season and obviously we want to try to become a better running team left and right inside and out hes a more complete player and hes got great upside
1600128 no hell we have so many quarterbacks i collect them so were going to have to figure out what to do well have a starter and well try to get as many guys in the game as we can but well make that assessment here in the next couple days and well go from there
1600129 hes a pro bowl quarterback that had a very good offseason hes in tremendous shape except for his calf so i feel good about garcia i really feel good with the way brian griese is moving this football team right now hes making a lot of throws really good decisions and hes handling the no huddle offense extremely well i like the flash that luke mccown has hes got some real flash playmaking ability weve just got to harness it a little bit better weve got to do a bit better job coaching
1600130 i didnt see much of the game last night obviously we had meetings ourselves but hall of fame weekend is more than just a preseason football game the introduction of emmitt thomas art monk darrell green gary zimmerman andre tippett what a great great weekend
1600131 obviously this is a different training camp than weve experienced weve been going indoors for the most part in the afternoon well have three or four guys normally get ivs in the morning but we havent had any in the afternoon our training staff todd toriscelli was at the university of miami down there hes on the cutting edge of dealing with the heat hydrating our players and taking care of them the cool down tent halfway through practice is a real good way to cool the body temperature also
1600132 another example of bretts childish love for the game and having fun while playing it
1600133 advances in semiconductor technology continue to deliver huge benefits to consumers as semiconductor devices deliver higher performance and increased functionality at lower cost
1600134 at the same time rapid price declines for microchips tend to mask the real growth of the industry the cost of 1 gb of dram has declined by 43 during the past year while the price of 2 gb of nand flash has declined by 61 in the last 12 months lower prices enable increased memory content in consumer devices micron estimates that the memory content of the average pc will increase at least 50 this year while the memory content in the average cell phone will increase by more than 150
1600135 the global dram market is showing renewed signs of weakness with prices expected to fall during the third quarter due to bloated inventories
1600136 oem contract prices for dram likely to decline in august and september

1600144 its a natural business for some of the larger providers to get into simply because one of the big aspects of the cloud is not just computing but the bandwidth
1600145 if youre a telecom provider since youre at the nexus of one of the demand points youd want to get into that business
1600146 regardless of whether or not at amp t offers anything of substance the release can only help maintain a level of cloud hype already in full effect
1600147 it seems the telecom biz is quickly becoming a poster child for cloud computing which is great given their regionalized positions having the ability to geographically scale will be made a lot easier if every countrys telecom provider offers localized cloud services
1600148 doesnt it hurt just a little to know that google is the leader in the silverlight advertising space before your company has even scratched the surface
1600149 surely it would make some sense to take control of the silverlight advertising space in a big way wouldnt it once again google has pulled the wool over microsofts eyes and the company is in the dark circling around wondering how in the world itll be able to beat google on something anything
1600150 if this isnt the catalyst microsoft needs i dont know what is
1600151 not only being boxed out of the advertising space all over the web but now its being boxed out of advertising on its own platform without even harnessing its power to fight back
1600152 microsofts very own platform is already being hijacked by its biggest competitor and it better move fast if it doesnt want to be pushed out of that advertising space too
1600153 why microsoft is not utilizing silverlight 2 to serve video ads coming from its advertising inventory
1600154 labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
1600155 it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free environment but the level and variety of these infections is concerning we need greater transparency in nhs infection control and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards
1600156 such findings are truly revolting how can patients be safe amid bed bugs fleas and rats once again safety is just rhetoric and not a reality for patients particularly the elderly and those with suppressed immunity
1600157 what about those trusts who ignored this freedom of information request and said nothing if these are the standards of those coming clean what does it say about those who stayed silent these findings reveal what happens when money is taken away from where patients expect to see it spent if these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business nhs trust boards must get a grip and show patients they are serious about their legal responsibility for safety
1600158 the use of pest control is seen as good proactive management
1600159 the healthcare commission have confirmed that health concerns around pest control have to date been negligible
1600160 the claim that insects spread hospital acquired infections is entirely unproven there is no evidence of their carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria being a hazard to patients despite this we expect hospitals to take continued action to tackle these pest problems

1600189 in fact their vision is that everyone experience jesus through service in community they recognized that there usually is no place for professionals executives and leaders to serve in the community or in churches therefore they created a program that can help guys like us find a useful place to serve

1600191 im involved in helping a local non profit create a business plan to improve efficiencies operations and increase visibility one thing that they had not done well is to develop a clear concise statement about who they are when i first came in the staff all had a vague idea about their purpose and mission but they werent speaking the same language its been great to help them frustrating too because they move slow but theyre making progress and i feel like im finally doing something useful

1600195 did you know we supported local ngos non governmental organizations in angola and indonesia to develop their capacity to effectively partner with multi national companies
1600196 she is not an authorized person to speak on behalf of the company
1600197 there are several inaccuracies on twitter we take great care in having authorized people speak on behalf of the company we want to make sure anyone who is speaking for the company is doing so accurately
1600198 we think its important that people are transparent and honest about whom they represent
1600199 we think they should be honest about where they are coming from
1600200 i believe we are the first major energy company here on twitter exxon mobile is trying to lead the way in corporate citizenship
1600201 exxon mobil reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 5 million metric tons from 2006 to 2007
1600202 although the valdez spill was tragic it was only 10 million gallons compare that to the 73 million in the nowruz oil field in 1983
1600203 brands should be monitoring the discussion and instances of their keywords in social networks failure to do so results in becoming case studies
1600204 the power has shifted to those that participate so while janet may have achieved momentum by participating further opportunity lies within exxon when theyre ready to come forward
1600205 its for a beautiful cause at a beautiful golf course
1600206 its all about playing a good round of golf with a lot of great people i always look forward to coming here jerry porricelli is a great guy who has been very supportive of my career
1600207 its for a good cause its nice to see old friends and we always have a lot of fun
1600208 we are technically in the third decade of our tournament and as we keep going our event gets bigger and bigger and better and better
1600209 we got a great turnout with great celebrities and local businesses
1600210 we have been lucky to be the recipient of the porricellis generosity jerry is on the board of directors and he provides wonderful leadership and support to abilis in many ways
1600211 it was a great event and i was glad to be a part of it
1600212 it was my first old timers day and with it being the last year of the stadium i wanted to come up for it it was neat i got to see a lot of people i played with but havent seen for years
1600213 i think an organization like that should have a top notch stadium
1600214 a new york team should have the best stadium in baseball the yankee fans deserve to be treated to nice facilities the stadium right now is not a class a type of facility
1600215 the game has changed so much since i have gotten out and i havent retired that long ago its amazing
1600216 we all used to hang out as buddies after the game now from what i understand guys go their separate ways and they dont see each other until the next day at the ballpark we were not like that when i played
1600217 even if they dont get the division there is the wild card
1600218 there is still 20 to 30 more games to go before you really start watching it close
1600219 it was nice to see a great rivalry like the lakers and celtics
1600220 unfortunately the lakers have come out second in most of those series the lakers had a good team and a good season but in the finals they were disappointing they just couldnt really solve that celtics defense
1600221 i love playing in this tournament because i knew jerry sr for many many years
1600222 i can actually become a fan like everyone else and watch the games and root for the home team i cant wait for the olympics to start
1600223 that would be the first time identical twins would be world champions were extremely close as twins brothers usually are
1600224 were so lucky to get a chance to come here to help those who are less fortunate than us
1600225 i do about 50 of these events every summer and i feel blessed to be able to come out and help for a worthy cause like this
1600226 sento el dolor que he causat per favor no odi n que aix els atorgui la compensaci emocional que estan buscant

1600228 vamos a tener gasoldependencia porque no s lo est pau tambi n est marc marc es un jugador muy importante para espa a es posible que jueguen los dos juntos depende de quienes sean los pivots rivales
1600229 hay posibilidades de utilizar a los dos ser gasol por un lado y gasol por otro
1600230 grecia viene de jugar el preol mpico donde ha marcado un gran nivel y es un partido diferente a todos los dem s en segundo lugar es un rival dificil simo como se demostr en la final del campeonato del mundo que es el partido que mejor ha jugado espa a ellos eliminaron en la semifinal a estados unidos y el a o pasado en el europeo estuvieron a punto de impedirnos el pase a la final adem s vienen con ritmo de competici n
1600231 el primer partido es muy importante porque marca un poco la l nea y grecia ha arrasado en el preol mpico adem s sus pivots tiran desde fuera y eso es una dificultad a adida para la defensa
1600232 i cant do the team much good unless i get healthy weve been trying to treat it for the last couple of days and it hasnt worked
1600233 we had a chance to use him in a less pressure situation but he wasnt effective
1600234 this is the best thing for his peace of mind
1600235 i knew id like it here but i didnt know id like it this much
1600236 a lot of these guys are going to be around for a while and ill be one of them i just couldnt be happier
1600237 i didnt realize what an intense competitor he is and what a big game pitcher he is
1600238 the better the opponent the tougher the game the more excited he is about pitching
1600239 weve got to keep winning games we dont have that big cushion where we can go out oh well we lost this game weve got to keep pace thats something new for a lot of these guys in here myself included
1600240 he looked like he was starting to feel it he was up four straight pitches that to me is when guys will feel it their next outing more than just the pitch count
1600241 his ball moved all over the place inside and out he looked like the playoff beckett
1600242 like with hitters you get a ball to fall and you feel better about yourself
1600243 the one thing he hasnt done is get frustrated and run into more outs hes been an intelligent base runner he got into situations tonight where he could steal it and he did
1600244 you kind of look around and no ones counting on you to be that guy
1600245 youre just a complementary piece to that puzzle i think there was a little bit of relaxation that goes with that i mean since ive been here ive got two guys on base every second or third time i get up there
1600246 depends on the way you look at it because the center fielder almost caught it
1600247 well take what we can get that was one of the more interesting plays youll ever see im not going to look a gift horse in the mouth
1600248 almost 90 percent of incumbents out there keep getting re elected because they use their money and power at the legislature to help with their campaigns
1600249 the problem is that we dont know who the people in our county are
1600250 weve got to deal with the economy and be fiscally conservative
1600251 including an underground party room which is not a necessity
1600252 should i take another swing should i hold it whatever it happens thats the way injuries are
1600253 tito talked to me about at some point slow me down for a minute but ill be out there
1600254 its part of the injury the doctor warned me about it he said youre going to be like that until you stop playing for a few months it happened a few times but i havent really felt it like i felt it last night
1600255 to know that youre maybe going to feel something at some point maybe it does mess with you maybe this will be good he felt it you know pat burrell went through the whole thing with me he goes i had to get through this i was fine maybe its a good step
1600256 i know getting out of bed my abs didnt hurt so ive got to believe thats a good sign
1600257 they say the problem is your ball and socket joint when you move theres usually a nice little leeway
1600258 just with the regular wear and tear of the season you get a little inflammation with the bone spurs i have it kind of pinches every time when it pinches it it kind of irritates it more and more it kind of snowballs from there
1600259 i dont think j d has any aspirations of becoming the next rickey henderson
1600260 but hes doing it kind of for the good of our team which i really appreciate
1600261 he had some good at bats over his last few starts we just ran into a lot of lefties
1600262 it was good when he gets on base it creates a lot of havoc and thats a great thing

1600282 am i spending the time of my life having the time of my life
1600283 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1600284 im glad my body could do it because now i know i have it in me
1600285 when i see that kid out there it brings a smile to my face
1600286 that would have been quite a story going back to the red sox where i started and where i learned to become a pitcher and all the other things i went through there
1600287 i signed a two year deal here and id like to see it through its great here ive had my best year and my family is comfortable here during the season
1600288 but looking back on those times with the red sox that was quite a time in my life i went through so many different emotions not knowing what i was going to be or whether i was going to go home and never have a chance to play this game at the major league level ill never forget it
1600289 everything ive experienced has made me stronger and made me appreciate what i have now i dont take one day for granted
1600290 one of my video guys here has a video of me getting my first major league hit and first home run
1600291 it was incredible to watch and see me in that red sox uniform it brought me back
1600292 i just remembered how much i loved playing the outfield and hitting i just wish id done it better but i always knew i had a strong arm i didnt know if i could make it as a pitcher but i just wanted to try and see what i could do with it i struggled took my lumps but i made it through
1600293 when i watched him in the outfield then he had good mechanics with his throwing and a nice arm slot
1600294 i remember having him in a ball in 1994 and then the replacement season came a year later
1600295 that offseason triple a manager buddy bailey took him to australia to play in the australian league and he came back a pitcher im telling you nobody worked any harder than this kid to become what he is today hes one of the best lefty relievers out there
1600296 and ive been able to learn how to pitch because ive had so many great pitching coaches starting with al nipper who first taught me the fosh changeup which enabled me to have another pitch besides the fastball to throw
1600297 believe me if al hadnt spent the time with me and taught me that pitch its really helped me so much against righthanded hitters
1600298 i was managing at rookie league with the red sox in winter haven and he was a level up and i remember after our games id go watch him play he could really play defense and throw
1600299 i think the thing that did him in was that he never could hit a curveball i think it was bob schaefer that suggested he turn into a pitcher and the kid really worked at it
1600300 hes been a pleasure to watch i think last weekend was the first time hed given up back to back home runs but hes been used by trey hillman royals manager in some of the most crucial situations
1600301 from what i understand if the deal was really really good for us i would have gone
1600302 but that didnt happen so im here and i really like it here in kansas city
1600303 we went the opposite way but the right way for both of us
1600304 i feel like i need to be turning that water into wine
1600305 i liked the openness of it it was a refreshing change
1600306 the important thing is that they are here its not just the question and answer session which of course is limited its the coffee afterwards and the chance to meet and talk to ministers a lot can get done at that time too

1600315 there are so many things we dont understand in life in spite of that lack of understanding though we often enjoy experiencing those things
1600316 its very very clear that we dont need to know all of the hows and whys of life to keep living on this planet
1600317 the scientists are not here to reveal the truth because we are here to seek it forever they are actually here to complicate the game of life so that we can have more questions and enjoy the game longer
1600318 seeing is important but trying to figure out everything isnt necessary
1600319 when we give more and communicate wholeheartedly we have less insecurity both emotionally and physically
1600320 giving love is the only way to be generously loved
1600321 the people who give more time money kindness love ideas have more of these things because thats the balance and balance is the natural law of life
1600322 one key in the giving process is never to expect a return when we give
1600323 we can feel the real joy of giving when were doing something for others knowing that were simply doing it for doing it for our own joy
1600324 giving something to others is so much easier than trying to get it first
1600325 every single one of us prospers when we learn to give value to others first we are rewarded naturally
1600326 were not here to give in order to get were here to have more to give more
1600327 because we cant have scarcity when we are totally grateful
1600328 what if giving actually was as important as brushing teeth
1600329 giving is not just about helping others it is about sharing the joy we do it for our own joy first and we pass it on
1600330 so without denying the benefit of having more innovation because it feels good can we find the way to have more joy in our life if we can then we can go beyond the temporal gratification we can create a sense of permanent certainty
1600331 charity organisations are like our out sourcing agencies for the giving of our life
1600332 businesses and charities are actually the same thing someone started the organisation with the passion to do something to make a difference
1600333 the moment we start giving out of guilt we appreciate charities far less
1600334 the moment we perceive someone as poor our perception creates the poor feeling in the other person
1600335 the moment we believe we have more were saying others have less and our attitude creates separation

1600341 for years the chinese government has tried to use the olympics to legitimise its illegal occupation of tibet

1600357 like you i find these camps intolerable but i find equally intolerable the use made of them every day in the bourgeois press
1600358 i see the olympics and the opening ceremonies as a chance to symbolize an important transformation in chinas self image
1600359 for most of the 20th century china viewed itself as a weak and vulnerable country that has been denied its historical place in the sun
1600360 it was bullied by foreign powers and it drew upon the legalist tradition to ruthlessly strengthen the state and mobilize the people for that purpose now that its more powerful and has begun to re establish its deserved place in the sun it can relax a bit and the traditional confucian ways of soft power can begin to reassert themselves
1600361 it is not entirely fanciful to surmise that the chinese communist party will be relabelled the chinese confucian party in the next couple of decades
1600362 its good to take a break from my hard work and it means that i can spend my time watching the olympics on television

1600633 the biggest issue that negatively impacted the quarter was the timing of deal flow with several large deals moving into the second quarter our quarterly results were not affected by the macro economic climate even with a few large deals falling into the second quarter our overall sales funnel has increased significantly as a result of the underlying strength of our business we are raising our guidance for fiscal 2009
1600634 what we have in common with companies who specialise in hard drive destruction is that we always recommend that organisations use a specialist supplier

1600638 at a time when there is a perception of green services costing a premium we are delighted to be able to tell customers that ours is cost neutral whats more while we are aware that it bosses do not have a green pound in their budgets the remarketing revenue that generates a black pound is eagerly accepted by the csr department for their projects and doesnt affect next years it spend

1600642 seven years after anthrax laced letters terrorized an already frightened nation a new suspect suddenly emerged in the public eye this week but he was gone just as quickly committing suicide before he could be charged with murder and adding another dramatic twist to the bizarre episode the governments working theory that brilliant but troubled army scientist bruce e ivins released the anthrax to test his cure for the toxin answers some of the questions perhaps but many details remain unclear i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure said former senate democratic leader tom daschle of south dakota whose office received a letter containing the deadly white powder in 2001 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today ivins unexpected emergence as the top and perhaps only suspect in the anthrax attacks follows on the heels of the governments exoneration of another army scientist in the case last month the justice department cleared ivins colleague steven hatfill who had been wrongly suspected in the case and paid him 5 8 million

1600647 from now until 2020 installed global solar capacity will grow by roughly 30 to 35 percent a year from 10 gigawatts today to about 200 to 400 gigawatts requiring capital investments of more than 500 billion even though this volume represents only 1 5 to 3 percent of global electricity output the roughly 20 to 40 new gigawatts a year of installed solar capacity would provide about 10 to 20 percent of annual new power capacity over that period this level of installed solar capacity would abate some 125 to 250 megatons of carbon dioxide roughly 0 3 to 0 6 percent of global emissions in 2020
1600648 within three to seven years unsubsidized solar power could cost no more than electricity generated by fossil fuels by 2020 global installed solar capacity could be 20 to 40 times its level today

1600677 we still have to change the squad but there will be an impact on the budget
1600678 celtic are in the group stage of the champions league so will now get all of scotlands tv money for that tournament
1600679 they are now a much more alluring prospect for transfer targets
1600680 rangers must reinforce too but they may also have to sell the likes of spanish defender carlos cuellar and french midfielder brahim hemdani to balance the books and neither are cup tied in europe
1600681 we have been looking to bring in at least one maybe two midfield players
1600682 but we have to wait and see what transpires when we take into account the ramifications of not having european football
1600683 if the benefit of european football is that you get champions league money to spend then of course when you dont have it we will have to be careful with what we do

1600686 the apparent death of googles pioneering pagerank patent under the ptos new rule for patentable subject matter may be a cause for celebration among those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation and are eager to confine the patent systems ambit
1600687 it will surely be cause for mourning among those who believe that allowing patents on cutting edge technologies has served the country well for more than two centuries and that a radical departure from the traditional approach would be unwise
1600688 google and other technology companies increasingly face mounting legal costs to defend against frivolous patent claims from parties gaming the system to forestall competition or reap windfall profits

1600746 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1600747 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1600748 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1600749 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1600750 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1600751 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1600779 we have seen so much improvement in our national team in recent years our club sides have flown the flag for our country in europe and our mens and womens national teams have risen up the world rankings there is a genuine sense of optimism about our future and this deal today only adds to it
1600780 that is one of the ones you can believe in the papers he is one of his the managers major targets but there are others who have not made the papers yet thankfully
1600781 david said last week in america i am only going to bring in players who will take the club forward and that is how he is
1600782 he is relentless in that i have never known david say hell do or thatll do he takes his time pinpoints and focuses
1600783 maybe it was my fault because of the chance i had you have to score those chances i cannot think of a worse night its a catastrophe
1600784 its disappointing and the players feel very bad right now weve not done enough and if theres a problem its with the players
1600785 its easy to blame the manager or other things but the players need to do a little more
1600786 its definitely the worst night of my career and its so disappointing
1600787 we need to do more and we need to change everything and try to go for the win you need a goal to win games
1600788 we played so many games last year around 65 its just four weeks or so break there have been a lot of games
1600789 the core of the team is still the same of course we had a little thing with cristiano ronaldo this summer but we have a good squad of players
1600790 during the season we are bound to suffer setbacks every team does
1600791 there will be injuries loss of form red cards and clearly we need luck at crucial times as well but hopefully we will end up in the right place
1600792 it is almost too tight to split them and results over the last few years confirm that
1600793 in the last three or four years it has been chelsea and manchester united going for the title
1600794 but liverpool won the champions league then lost the final a couple of years later arsenal have been in it as well
1600795 you can see from our results in europe how much quality there is in the premier league so i expect us all to be quite close to each other
1600796 a lot of people say that i should have gone to united instead but i had already had two meetings with juventus before united came in
1600797 but of course the allegations and certain things that happened were not nice
1600798 i just hope they learn from it and they will be part of the italian elite again
1600799 maybe it did not end the way i wanted but it was a great experience
1600800 i never played to my full potential it was my first time abroad and juventus played quite differently to the way we played at ajax
1600801 i had to get used to a lot of different things and although i was able to speak the language in about three months sometimes on the pitch i was half a second late shouting something and the moment had gone which was unfortunate
1600802 a lot of people say that i should have gone to united instead but i had already had two meetings with juventus before united came in
1600803 it was not like i was talking to palermo or fiorentina they were two great clubs on the same level and you cannot make choices with the benefit of hindsight
1600804 some of them will have to change their mindsets and stand up to confrontation
1600805 they wouldnt be the ideal choice as captain it would probably mean them nominating somebody else in the team for the referee to consult on the pitch
1600806 we need captains to take a greater level of responsibility in helping referees manage the game
1600807 but we still need referees to deal firmly with dissent with no running away from confrontation we have the assurance that their actions will be backed up the authorities
1600808 football can engage and inspire but at times we know it can also spill over and get ugly we all have a responsibility to deal with these excesses
1600809 players are seen as role models and our members have to accept that there were some things last season that did not look too pretty
1600810 i think it is disrespectful to think that you are in the third round already football is a funny game and anything can happen
1600811 i dont worry too much about what anyone else says
1600812 we need to try and hold them for as long as we can the biggest thing is that we dont give them an early goal
1600813 i do feel that they might have changed their opinion of us from the game in dublin
1600814 it was end to end one all for so long and then we let in the second goal i was delighted with how we played as i said after the game
1600815 brian shelley gives us a good option hes quick and always a good player to have with the fact that they dont play the ball long
1600816 lets not sugar coat it this was a disaster of a result the fans are more upset than i can remember
1600817 the feel good factor from manchester uefa cup final has totally and utterly gone its hard to see where we go from here and its down to the people in charge to show us
1600818 the fear is that players will be sold to balance the books and the fans simply will not stand for it we are totally gutted
1600819 you could call it a disaster but you could also say that the second half display was a disgrace
1600820 they looked clueless against what was hardly a world class team
1600821 the loss of money from going out of europe is one thing but fans want to see what is on the park and the evidence of what we have seen tonight there wasnt much
1600822 and if you are honest there were signs of that at the end of the season
1600823 there is another couple of weeks before the transfer window closes and if ever there was evidence that we needed something especially in the middle of the park then tonight was it
1600824 there is a gaping hole there and it needs to be filled
1600825 our agm is this week and there will be fans coming from all over the world
1600826 there will be a question and answer session at murray park on friday morning with sir david murray walter and martin bain
1600827 you have to consider what he achieved last season when we were going for the quadruple
1600828 there is no need to tell him what a disaster this is he went through similar during his first time at ibrox
1600829 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
1600830 it was another good work out it was a good game with four goals for us and good play
1600831 but the players arent 100 yet that would be difficult right now the other team were fitter than us but you could see we were passing pressing and the understanding between the players was better i am really pleased with the result
1600832 normally when you have quality when you are playing well and creating chances you will score goals
1600833 i am not jose mourinho so why compare me with him mourinho says i will win 10 championships but i am more modest than that
1600834 i am from south brazil and in my culture we never say i will win this or that i just say that i will try my best to win all the competitions
1600835 but mourinho is mourinho he has a different culture to me
1600836 since i came to chelsea we have only spent 8million on deco jose bosingwa came in before i arrived
1600837 maybe in the past they have spent more money but now they dont need to spend as much because they already have a solid base now they need a coach to develop young players and i think i am that coach
1600838 they will either help you get things done or they can prevent things from getting done
1600839 we have all of walt disneys correspondence that was thank goodness maintained by his secretaries and its well arranged by year and then alphabetical by each year it must be a couple hundred boxes of correspondence we have roy disneys correspondence too
1600840 i was not very artistic at all and i was never very good at inking and painting
1600841 later walt made me his secretary but i made too many mistakes when he was dictating he always said i was so bad he had to marry me they tried to use me as a secretary but i wasnt very good at it so i went back to painting
1600842 you stick to your job and ill stick to mine
1600843 the hyperion studio was a fun place to work everyone was so young and excited about what was being created we all worked like dogs but we enjoyed every minute of it
1600844 how are walts finances dont let him get involved in some crazy scheme let me know if theres something that doesnt seem right
1600845 lets shut down this office weve got disneyland we dont need the studio
1600846 i would put ice and water in it and then float the scotch on top and not give him very much of it he may have consumed a lot of liquid but i dont think he really got much liquor
1600847 thats a hell of a greeting when you get home
1600848 i would answer the intercom yes sir and hed say yes walt
1600849 the next time it would be yes sir and hed correct me again yes walt
1600850 i had it taped on my intercom until the day he died
1600851 shortly before he went into the hospital at the end of the workday walt sat talking to tommie and me about cal arts and epcot
1600852 walt was unusually tired as he got up and said sometimes i just feel like chucking it all then he looked over at me and said but lucille and her girls need me that we do i said and walt smiled ive always cherished his saying that
1600853 you know madeline i can never pay you what youre worth

1600869 social kissing has been common in certain circles in britain since the 1920s but until fairly recently it was mostly confined to relatives or close friends and to what you might call the excitable professions the theatre the media fashion anywhere you might call someone darling basically its now infinitely more widespread even accountants do it
1600870 were now starting to see the advent of non sexual lip kissing
1600871 the british werent even very good at the handshake and now we find ourselves having to deal with air kisses cheek kisses hugs squeezes even lip kisses its not easy the basic rule i think should be that handshakes are fine with anyone and kisses should be reserved for people you have some kind of relationship with even if its only a business lunch at which youve talked about something other than just business
1600872 if you kiss at one meeting and not at the next theyre going to get entirely the wrong message

1600948 criminals very rarely use such guns worse yet these politicians work to pass laws that disarm the law abiding citizens while they themselves are gun control is sexist guns allow a little old lady to fend off a larger and stronger attacker they allow a young woman to stop a criminal from attacking her at the door to her home guns enable a pregnant woman to stop two home invaders in short guns allow the physically weaker members of society to defend themselves against the physically stronger members of society since as a matter of biology and perhaps our cultural norms men tend to be larger and stronger than women and can often overpower them physically that means that banning guns puts the women at a relative disadvantage even if the gun ban were to keep guns out of the hands of everyone now take into account the fact that criminals will break the law and still have guns and the disarmed women are at an even greater disadvantage gun control is ignorance politicians will go on television to argue in favor of gun bans without even understanding what they are trying to ban an example congresswoman mccarthy assault weapon

1600950 wir m chten mit den eurogames einen begegnungsort schaffen auf uns aufmerksam machen und die kooperation einzelner interessenvertreter verbessern
1600951 unentwegt werde ich gefragt ob wir auf diese weise nicht ein ghetto f r homosexuelle sportler schaffen w rden aber ghettos werden nicht von menschen geschaffen sie sind vielmehr ein produkt der gesellschaft
1600952 im fu ball zum beispiel sind die meisten beschimpfungen homophober natur
1600953 nur wenige werden jedoch offen aufgrund ihrer sexuellen orientierung bestraft meistens werden homosexuelle hinter dem deckmantel anderer gesetzes bertretungen verfolgt
1600954 peking hat andere dinge im kopf auch wenn die regierung weiterhin nicht davon abl sst sexuelle minderheiten zu verfolgen so werden zum beispiel regelm ig schwulenbars gest rmt es ist die angst vor dem unbekannten viele glauben homosexuelle w rden dem image der stadt schaden die rechte der homosexuellen befinden sich ganz unten auf der priorit tenliste chinas
1600955 einige machen sich im internet f r ihre rechte stark das internet ist der einzige raum wo die chinesischen homosexuellen unter sich sein k nnen
1600956 im jenseits f r ihre handlungen auf das sch rfste bestraft
1600957 die verbreitung dieser krankheiten durch sexuelle freiz gigkeit und schamlose und anormale geschlechtliche beziehungen ist nichts anderes als eine wundersame verwirklichung dessen was der prophet bereits vorhersagte
1600958 der prophet bekr ftigte in mehreren hadithen dass homosexuelle m nner zu t ten seien die muslimischen br der seien daher daran erinnert einem homosexuellen nicht die hand zu sch tteln denn man wei nie was f r bakterien und keime sich an seiner hand befinden und verderben bringen k nnten
1600959 der integrationsbeauftragte ist jetzt gefordert einen dialog zwischen muslimischen organisationen und schwul lesbischen verb nden zu initiieren
1600960 wer nichts getan hat der braucht doch nichts zu f rchten
1600961 aber die interessen der beteiligten sind dann doch immer st rker als der wunsch das netz f r alle bequemer zu machen
1600962 warum sollen wir dem z gellosen z gel anlegen dem ungeregelten regeln verpassen dem frei atmenden ein korsett anlegen
1600963 it was really a goof it was a one off
1600964 i wasnt something i was expecting to get news coverage
1600965 a normal person who does insane things on the internet
1600966 the consequences on other people is a great conversation and its one that we havent fully resolved
1600967 just because i dont empathize in this scenario does not mean that i never empathize
1600968 i am frequently rude unsympathetic unempathetic and politically incorrect to put it mildly but theres no law against that
1600969 the in stadium experience is critically important to the nfl our clubs and our fans and it will be a major focus this season
1600970 we are committed to improving the fan experience in every way we can from the time fans arrive in the parking lot to when they depart the stadium
1600971 verbal or physical harassment of fans from the opposing team

1600974 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
1600975 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
1600976 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
1600977 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
1600978 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
1600979 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
1600980 the reign of charlemagne was greatly aided by a general improvement in the weather during the eight and ninth centuries
1600981 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
1600982 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
1600983 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
1600984 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
1600985 real results by the end of my first term in office
1600986 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy

1600990 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
1600991 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
1600992 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
1600993 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
1600994 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
1600995 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
1600996 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
1600997 the difference between men and boys are the price of their toys
1600998 this sport it probably happens more times than you know and guys wont admit it
1600999 its one of those things that he was strong enough to admit it and more power to him
1601000 i dont think we have any guys on this team who wouldnt want the best for shawn
1601001 i think everybody here including the coaches want the best for shawn they understand how grave the situation is were going to do everything we can to make it an easy transition and get ready for the season
1601002 in life you dont want to show weakness but youve got to do what youve got to do if you let depression get control of you youre done you might as well handle it now
1601003 im not a doctor but depression can stem from anything
1601004 money doesnt make you happy obviously he is successful he just got a new deal all those things dont necessarily make you happy
1601005 he is too good a player to have something like that lay him down other than that i dont know what kind of stigma it holds theres a lot of pressure on people in the game that outsiders really dont know about
1601006 everybody handles things differently theres a lot of other outside forces at work it was a good choice on his part to stay away heaven forbid youre going through depression and then you came to practice and got someone else hurt now youve got that on top of you too
1601007 im here for him but as a player i am going to do what i have to do to make this team
1601008 i feel sorry for him im with him but ive got to do what ive got to do
1601009 depression is something you dont want to play with when a person is depressed he needs as much support as he can get hopefully the guys who did have negative things to say about it will follow suit and rally around him
1601010 a lot of people think it cant happen this is a very tough game its a nonstop job they say off season but there really isnt an off season
1601011 non contrasta certamente con il diritto del minore a ricevere cura educazione e istruzione da entrambi i genitori ancorch separati

1601014 wake forest has an up and coming team i like their style of play and they play in one of the best conferences in the county
1601015 i figured if he decided to go away it would be wake forest
1601016 the only thing ill say is that i know coach andy reid has spent an awful lot of time with that situation ill talk about the players that are in camp here
1601017 max has taken advantage of his opportunity and he has done an excellent job
1601018 you win with guys like max max is a fighter hes big and strong and gives big effort he loves to play the game and when you love to play the game youre going to work hard and youre going to get better every day
1601019 as you know there are many players that have caught up and caught up quick and usually those are the guys that have experience
1601020 every year we come out at least one or two times
1601021 well talk to the scouts and coaches about certain players who are having a good camp and we also like to see how they run things
1601022 at the same time johnson threw a good game he had a good game
1601023 we invited all the outfielders who played a certain number of games he definitely was invited
1601024 we would love for him to come he was definitely a big part of this organization
1601025 let me say this ive never been more nervous on the field in my life
1601026 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time
1601027 this is the only time im going to help you
1601028 this is a really unique and strange situation for me because honestly i dont have anything negative to say to kelly pavlik
1601029 hes a real blue collar worker because he comes from a different environment but the same mentality ive come from
1601030 but i think with our pressure and the amount of punches i throw theres a possibility
1601031 saying those nice words they dont mean that im not going to go out and do my job
1601032 having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1601033 the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going toward the growth of the game
1601034 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that is already interested in the game
1601035 its for growing the game around the world and something we can all do together
1601036 the value for the players is that the more people that play around the world the more people will be watching theyll be paid back eventually
1601037 i want to watch the olympic sports where basically professionals arent playing
1601038 where that is the absolute pinnacle of their career and they had to wait four years for this one moment and they go out and they perform break a world record win a gold medal and they were able to perform on the spot
1601039 im not competing until next year so ive got another five months to kill
1601040 this one is more frustrating because im the two time defending champion
1601041 right kind rooted in the real lives of real people
1601042 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
1601043 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
1601044 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
1601045 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
1601046 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
1601047 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
1601048 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
1601049 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
1601050 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
1601051 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
1601052 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
1601053 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
1601054 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
1601055 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
1601056 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
1601057 obama will announce wednesday evan bayh r in is my veep
1601058 a smattering of house republicans are engaging in stunts on the house floor in a transparent political effort to manufacture headlines meanwhile most of their republican colleagues returned home burdened with trying to explain why they blocked efforts to combat high gas prices
1601059 democrats today are pro actively offering short term solutions to high costs at the pump as well as a long term strategy to break our dependence on foreign oil its a shame republicans are more interested in playing games than enacting real solutions
1601060 this band of brothers here is staying late to make a point to the american people we want to work
1601061 the 109th congress vies for the title of the all time worst congress
1601062 it spent little time in session it failed to pass budget resolutions and appropriations bills there was no serious oversight of the disaster in iraq there were no major substantive policy achievements and corrupt members were forced from congress
1601063 barack obama is apparently a crazy man talking about deflated bridgestones behind a cage full of radials
1601064 simplexity why simple things become complex and how complex things can be made simple
1601065 it feels like yesterday i still think about it every chance i get if i want to go outside or something like that i remember it
1601066 the feeling you get when youre so close to getting the gold and you dont to me thats the worst feeling you can have and i didnt forget it
1601067 i broke two world records at 2004 trials and all that did was put more pressure on me
1601068 you know wow this kid set two world records hell win the gold for sure but now i know its experience that makes you successful at the olympics
1601069 i gave everything in the pool i left it all out there it wasnt there it just wasnt my day im going to show these guys how to beat him kitajima because if i cant do it im going to make sure that they do
1601070 if you ask anybody in japan to name the best american swimmer they know id say theyd name brendan hansen
1601071 i was just a fiery little guy trying to swim fast
1601072 there are a lot of aspects that go into swimming i didnt always touch on the mental aspects
1601073 and i dont really see a difference the same guys designed it who made lance armstrongs biking suit and he won seven tour de frances so they kind of know what theyre doing
1601074 the last thing im worrying about going in to the trials is what suit im wearing
1601075 you look at what you can bring to the table now and for me i have experience and i think experience is what makes you successful in the olympics
1601076 its all about staying calm and collected in that very pressurized situation
1601077 when i reached my goal in 04 to finally make the team by the time of the olympics i was just emotionally exhausted
1601078 i was 10 pounds lighter and just not in the shape i needed to be in to be successful
1601079 if you play in this country live in this country and you grow up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not a patriotic person in my mind
1601080 i stopped praying for god to put me on that u s team
1601081 and i just said show me very clearly where you want me to go what you want me to do open doors shut doors ill go whichever way you open
1601082 it was in my contract to say would you agree if such and such plays out you would play for our national team it wasnt until december or january of this year that i started seriously thinking about it
1601083 rather than starting with a core and working our way out we decided wed start with a larger national team be as inclusive as possible because of everyones overseas commitments then select the team closer to olympic time
1601084 our position is that she has every right to do exactly what she did
1601085 in her opinion she didnt have a shot to make our team so she went with the russian contract not every player was offered that opportunity i know it was a difficult decision for her
1601086 i wish i had the opportunity i wish i had been given the opportunity will you come play with us from usa basketball and russia saying well pay you 20 million to play for us and watch what decision i would have made watch i would have loved to have been given that opportunity that would just settle any money any patriotic dispute
1601087 youre just in a position of doing scouting reports and making suggestions
1601088 theres no decision making on my part that will directly affect the games
1601089 she has a tremendous chance to be an olympic head coach
1601090 she has all the leadership qualities the resume as a player and shes building her resume as a coach
1601091 i think she will be the olympic coach one day its just hard to predict exactly when
1601092 its always possible things can change based on who or what people feel would be the best for the program
1601093 dawn has a unique quality in that she has played with half of this team before she still has leadership amongst the players
1601094 its not quite the same as being on the floor with them but she has a unique position of having played with so many of them before
1601095 i think shell be invaluable to the head coach and other coaches but also the players
1601096 ill have my phone my sidekick e mail all of that so well be in touch
1601097 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1601098 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1601099 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1601100 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1601101 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1601102 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1601103 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1601104 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1601105 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction
1601106 the way i look at it i beat myself tonight
1601107 you feel awfully sorry for the little boy his parents and probably what hes going to have to deal with for a good bit
1601108 they said he seems to be ok the first thing you see is your children its unfortunate but we had to continue to play
1601109 the task force security advisors do not include any of our security people and in our view i dont see anything that will have changed
1601110 completed their investigation into a criminal sex case involving intercourse against the laws of nature
1601111 obey the instructions of the security officials to safeguard public safety and security
1601112 the lady behind the counter said that we werent allowed to get
1601113 when things are that emotionally powerful and hard to fathom its easy for people to say well its happening over there but its not happening in my neighborhood
1601114 we do that in many areas of our lives so its not that surprising that wed do it in our homes
1601115 should really be paying attention and figuring out what sort of impact this has on their own home and taking a dose of reality
1601116 its human nature to say my homes worth a million dollars i want to get a million
1601117 weve had a tremendous upset in the aviation industry which has impacted our airport operations
1601118 consumer spending is down the dollar is weak that has also really impacted imports at the seaport its been a prudent decision to adjust to the economic realities
1601119 were projecting a 20 percent reduction in passenger seats next year and a 14 percent reduction in passengers
1601120 were not understanding how they can possibly get the work done that remains
1601121 now the waterfront is alight with cranes and terminals but the business hasnt quite come
1601122 to do all that build up they put themselves in rather severe debt the problem now is not revenue but that the debt is coming due
1601123 sure i would like the road to nome but if i cant afford to live here that road is going to do me no good
1601124 weve reverted back to saying heres 1 200 you decide best how to deal with your heating and fuel costs its easier to let the people decide themselves rather than us
1601125 twelve hundred dollars in one part of alaska does not meet the same needs that 1 200 in another part of alaska does
1601126 we cant lose the majority of these games when we play the marlins and the mets
1601127 weve got to win some of these games weve got to play a little bit better than 500 in these games
1601128 i really dont know if i gave them a chance to do that
1601129 i think my command was so poor tonight that really didnt matter
1601130 i think that its definitely new to him and it would take him a while to really get used to the bullpen
1601131 but i tell you since they got johnson and sanchez back that definitely makes their rotation solid theyre a good team
1601132 this is a job for us but they are protecting everything that this country is about
1601133 if youre not going to be supportive of that and theyre coming out here to get away from reality as an american you have to support them the reality is theyre fighting a couple different wars right now
1601134 im just proud of what they stand for and the job they are doing
1601135 we go away for training camp for a month they go away for a year and a half at a time theyre coming out here to watch us as a break i feel honored that they chose us to come and watch
1601136 we flew over the ocean and did all the tricks they use in the show
1601137 its good to be king if just for a while
1601138 the benching certainly meant something throughout the evaluation leading up to the draft that was one reason we had the opportunity to select him in the seventh round but he gets into our training camp now its a clean slate lets go hes got every opportunity to make the most of this
1601139 theres no question he has the measurables size the long arms it appears like he has the skill and ability to really be a good tackle
1601140 now were early hes got a lot of hard work and preparation left to go
1601141 he was telling me to keep working hard he asked me how i thought it was offensive line coach juan castillo told me going in it was going to be a battle its about what i expected
1601142 i guess im doing something good he didnt really get on me about anything
1601143 hes a good athlete hes got a little bit of a sore ankle but hes played through that and hes done very well with it it hurts him a little bit when hes being bull rushed because he cant put his foot in the ground like he wants to hes moving around very well hes got very long arms and knows how to use them hes not afraid to play the game out in front of him ive been impressed with the way hes handled himself
1601144 not really my teammates more just everybody who had doubts about me
1601145 coming in here the coaches believe in me they wouldnt have taken me if they didnt but proving outsiders wrong everybody who didnt think i would be any good thats really my motivation right now
1601146 the in stadium experience is critically important to the nfl our clubs and our fans and it will be a major focus this season
1601147 we are committed to improving the fan experience in every way we can from the time fans arrive in the parking lot to when they depart the stadium
1601148 we are aware of shawns situation through his representation agent rich moran we are monitoring the situation
1601149 the teams idea was for me to come up there the nfl is a big deal especially in philadelphia
1601150 obviously there was a situation going on if there wasnt hed have been here at camp
1601151 im glad that now hes finding help and that hell be better soon
1601152 we have a lot of good guys who can help
1601153 i think everybody here including coaches would want the best for shawn and understand be very sympathetic to his situation were going to do everything we can to make it the easiest transition and try to get him ready for the season
1601154 you never know whats on the other side of the life
1601155 family money theres a lot of other forces besides football that could affect him
1601156 this is his fifth year he knows the system he knows what he can do hes a pro bowl caliber player hes all pro
1601157 its not like guys are going to be like ah he just doesnt want to play if theres something going on and he just needed to get a handle on it i dont think anybodys going to turn a cold shoulder to him because of that
1601158 depression is kind of an intimate type of thing you dont want people really knowing about that it doesnt have to be public information
1601159 you win with guys like max max is a fighter
1601160 were not even in the middle of training camp here
1601161 im here for him but as a player i have to do what i have to do to make this team
1601162 you could talk to shawn and hed tell you the same thing
1601163 andy has been nothing but sensitive to shawns situation he didnt disclose this personal issue even though he has been peppered with questions about it
1601164 andy didnt find out shawn wasnt mentally prepared to go to camp until 24 hours before
1601165 i talked to andy right after that and he told me it was in shawns best interest for me to fly to little rock and assess the situation andy thought it would be best if we made shawn a doctors appointment
1601166 once we got the appointment it took a few days to find out the diagnosis that finally happened last thursday and it took a few days for shawn to feel comfortable about it
1601167 why would you not send the letter if you dont know what the problem is they didnt know until they finally got the diagnosis it was andy who suggested to me that i go meet with shawn and andy has communicated with shawn and directly with the doctor weve been working together to do whats best for shawn and whats best for the eagles
1601168 now that coach reid understands that i have stepped forward and i do have a problem and im trying to get it rectified i think hes more sensitive to whats going on
1601169 i admitted that some of the rumors that have been out there actually were started by myself initially he didnt know what to think because im telling him one thing and hes hearing all these other rumors coach reid he does have a heart and i respect coach reid and the organization
1601170 im still under a doctors care i have another appointment thursday and i cant go in there faking im ready to go back the problem isnt going to go away if i fake it im going to see my doctor and my medication is slowly taking effect so i hope to be back and i want to be back well see how it plays out
1601171 were making it clear to legislators how much people are hurting
1601172 because right now my season with just two wins is i think just ok but if i were to come through and win this event it would make an ok year a great one
1601173 winning the last major could turn it into something special
1601174 im imagining it probably wasnt too nice were they complimenting my outfit i obviously didnt like the way i finished but i was so glad that i was in a position where every shot counted and mattered in a pressure situation heading into this event
1601175 but i felt like i hit a lot of good shots so i cant get too disappointed because there wasnt any one thing that was deficient
1601176 from a players point of view i dont really notice tigers absence too much
1601177 the atmosphere for the competition seems to be the same and everybodys into their own games trying to get their best out of them
1601178 its a situation i cant handle you just leave it up to god
1601179 i didnt know anything andrews was always happy always smiling but i feel sorry for him im with him but i dont know whats going on everybody goes through their own little problems
1601180 from a human being standpoint you always wish for the best for others
1601181 you dont want anyone to ever have any kind of mental breakdown like that
1601182 but there are distractions every year at training camp the big thing is not to pay as much attention to it as the media does i mean if you want to feed your family you better worry about yourself and what you are doing first
1601183 the only thing ill say is that i know that coach reid has spent an awful lot of time with that situation ill talk about the players that are in camp here
1601184 what that guy didnt understand is that maddy finished sixth in the world in the world whats he ever been sixth in the world at
1601185 i have swimmers who have olympic moments all the time
1601186 the investigation in our eyes is not complete but we could not find evidence of slaughter or waste
1601187 we have been in denial from the beginning and now its panning out that way we feel that there was nothing that was done wrong
1601188 this is huge this is something that we have troopers saying they have never seen a case of this magnitude when it comes to wanton waste
1601189 the count that were looking at isnt the whole 120 were looking at the ones that involve the wanton waste which would have been the 60 that were either not salvaged at all or only partially salvaged
1601190 we are not trying to hide anything we are doing our investigation and there is no reason that we would inflate the numbers
1601191 we as inupiat people have always lived off the land the sea our way of life has always been so close to nature
1601192 they still hunt with the skin boats and everything like that and this really hurt the village quite a bit to know the residents did something like this
1601193 the response from people out in the world is just so negative and so violent towards us now when the facts were not even true
1601194 we want to let our community know that we will deal with it and punish them to the full extent of the law whatever it takes to ensure this never happens again
1601195 our perception is no we are not getting any cooperation from villagers
1601196 were beginning to see that it was all blown out of proportion
1601197 we feel confident that there wasnt any wrongdoing that was done but if there was then well act on it
1601198 its taken him a while but hes started to throw better and more consistently
1601199 i think hes feeling better health wise he seems to be bouncing back better but again right now our starters are doing a pretty good job and were pretty pleased with how guys have done overall we dont have any plans to bring him to the big leagues as of now well continue to monitor his progress
1601200 yeah were definitely concerned about that we dont want him to lose his edge and stuff like that or his conditioning because hes not getting the work
1601201 hes here because we feel like right now we need him
1601202 and hes good enough to be here we feel like he may help us who are we going to replace him with
1601203 if we had our druthers wed have him stretched out and pitching every fifth day
1601204 but right now we feel like wed rather have him pitching in the big leagues than not
1601205 i remember numerous discussions amongst friends and no name ever came up
1601206 we just couldnt come up with a candidate we thought was dynamic enough
1601207 either everyones apathetic and doesnt care or theyre happy i have a theory that people go through these spells when they just dont seem to care about local government
1601208 when theres a big issue i remember during debates over coal bed methane people accused you of getting money from people who support it or dont support it but in state politics its always about partisan politics
1601209 i think its a crying shame because the real driving wheel comes locally i truly believe they dont realize that is what pushes the day to day
1601210 im running again because i think were moving in the right direction
1601211 i feel that i can do even more good than i did over the last three years because i have a lot more knowledge
1601212 in the back of my mind for quite some time
1601213 trying to get the best bang for the buck that we have
1601214 so i dont know i couldnt tell you why i think that i have no particular reason
1601215 i think i will be ready but unfortunately you cant be 100 percent sure until you actually tee it up and play but i believe i can do it im pretty comfortable with the test ahead
1601216 that wouldnt weigh on me at all that gives you something to write about this is about playing your best golf and seeing if you come out on top
1601217 there will always be somebody missing it doesnt work like that you can only win the tournament youre playing in you can only win the week youre playing and you can only beat the field thats there so at the end of the day it doesnt matter whos here
1601218 the last 15 years maybe theres been a little bit of a lull in european golf in terms of winning majors but obviously theres plenty of good european players around now and theres plenty of them capable of winning
1601219 extremely healthy conversations brutally honest conversations everything you wanted to say and wanted to ask went on in our conversations
1601220 we agreed to disagree we stood on opposite sides of the fence on a number of issues the no 1 thing i was looking for out of the conversation was is he really committed to playing football for us his mind set based on some of the things that have happened thats not where he was his feeling was based on where he is he wasnt in the right mind set to play
1601221 he was not in the right mind set to be part of this football team the train has left the station i have to keep the train moving if he wants to jump on the train lets go but if he cant get past the things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1601222 im just trying to stay focused on the things i can control and thats my practice and leading this team
1601223 the team has backed me the whole offseason and i appreciate that back in march after favre announced his retirement they said i was going to be the guy and theyve stuck with that
1601224 its to the point now where were just tired of it here in the locker room
1601225 just hearing about it hopefully theyll get something done upstairs and they can answer these questions instead of you asking us these questions we just get paid to play football
1601226 im just tired of it bretts a friend however it works out i hope hes happy however it works out i hope rodgers happy i hope whatever decision they make they make the best decision to help us get to the super bowl
1601227 very personal i respect the way he feels this has been something thats been extremely stressful for him and for his family hes got a lot going through his head right now i think hes in a tough spot
1601228 were looking into the entire procedures at the landfill were going to interview employees who were there when the alleged exposure took place
1601229 utterly failed to explain how cardinals alleged conduct could reasonably be regarded as violating any of the laws
1601230 the prime ministers much criticised website to track grocery prices made its debut this morning revealing something many families living in the regional areas already know buying groceries in broome darwin alice springs and even hobart is more expensive than the big cities
1601231 yes it was sensitive privacy information but not the stuff that was most sensitive
1601232 its obvious that the amount of disposable income is less
1601233 people are reprioritizing how they spend their money theyre paying their utilities theyre paying the cost of gas so somethings got to give
1601234 when we started to use our family funds to support it my husband said no more its just too much
1601235 it might just be fear people are just afraid to even try
1601236 especially in consumer finance we have seen a pretty big increase in the number of loans weve had to turn down
1601237 a lot of them are people that just dont have the capacity to comfortably handle this debt
1601238 weve done more this year than i remember ever doing
1601239 in every different kind of aspect the economy is hitting people and businesses everywhere no doubt
1601240 people are not buying the toys people are not going out and buying a new house
1601241 can you see anything we can do to scale down without losing coverage
1601242 i havent gotten rid of anything appliances i havent turned off anything
1601243 the more im around it the more im convinced its possible to go zero energy
1601244 we havent changed our lifestyle any not in the least
1601245 what i hear is they voters are tired of hearing us say were going to do something and then not do it
1601246 if i saw it on the ballot without figures i wouldnt vote for it
1601247 i dont think the public is going to give us carte blanche
1601248 its a giant project for anchorage in terms of the amount of people it will take and the amount of equipment it will take
1601249 this one is big in the complexity of it because it needs to be built in the busiest part of anchorage
1601250 if youre one of the tens of thousands living north of anchorage and wanting to go to the kenai peninsula or girdwood or whittier youre basically routed through town
1601251 itd be wonderful to drive across anchorage and not hit a stoplight
1601252 is there is going to be a lot of impact wherever it goes
1601253 youll see some of us including myself out there chaining ourselves to bulldozers
1601254 connecting the two highways would remove 200 000 trips per day from tudor 15th gambell and muldoon
1601255 youve got kids on the west side who cant take advantage of the rec center because they have to cross those streets and you have people on the east who have to walk across those streets to get their groceries
1601256 five dollar four dollar gas thats a scenario we have to consider we have to provide the public with better mass transit
1601257 a light rail needs to be an integral part of this
1601258 and the glenn and muldoon interchange needs to be fixed now when that mall opens its going to be a nightmare
1601259 the state should step in with some of its billions of dollars in oil money and get muldoon redesigned and rebuilt now
1601260 what else can we do in anchorage with three quarters of a billion dollars the list is long
1601261 this is a solution for 2 20 a gallon gas not 4 50 a gallon gas we dont have good balance here youve got to have trails that connect buses that work
1601262 we dont see this as the broader transportation solution for that stretch of road itd be pretty cool but is it the best thing for anchorage it doesnt come close
1601263 obviously id like it to still stay a part of the yankee lore id like it to be somewhere in the stadium i hope they can do that
1601264 i am so grateful and respectful of mr steinbrenner for leaving it empty for 29 years thats the biggest tribute you could ever ask for im sure whatever they do will be fitting
1601265 it should be in the same spot theyve got to find a spot for it
1601266 they had it opened for so long over here and i think they should do the same thing over there leave it the way it is
1601267 they should put it right back in the same spot
1601268 new stadium or old stadium right in the same spot
1601269 when i was in high school when i was running it was like an out of body experience
1601270 when we were younger growing up him throwing the ball to me it was natural hed want to keep it that way
1601271 you wont catch me doing something because i have bills
1601272 when you get caught get suspended they cut your money if i was to test positive for something that stops my money then what am i going to do if i was to get second all my life working hard doing it naturally thats just what i am
1601273 something like that makes you look at life a different way
1601274 i think theres a chance he signs with the phillies
1601275 one of freddys big criteria is playing on a winning team that has a chance to play into october
1601276 that is what replay is going to be there for and replay is coming very soon i cant give you a date but its going to be this year
1601277 there are a lot of factors in replay that i could go on and on about there are a lot of ballparks that are not umpire friendly when it comes to border calls thats how they build them theyre fan friendly and they dont want to change that
1601278 do we like that no but you know what were losing that war so well accept it and well move on and deal with however major league baseball wants us to deal with it and thats about all i can say about it but victorinos line drive is a perfect example of why they want replay
1601279 i look at it now and it looks like it just went foul just missed the pole foul ball after talking to the guys nobody was 100 percent sure one way or the other were not going to flip a call unless weve got it 100 percent
1601280 he goes i dont know i think you missed it but i dont know and he was the closest guy to it
1601281 from a technical standpoint why wouldnt we want to get the play right it seems like we were kind of behind the times and everybody knew what the call was except for the four guys umpires on the field
1601282 there has never been a fighter who remained this good this deep into his career as bernard hopkins has done it almost seems like he doesnt age at all
1601283 you have to make him fight 3 minutes of every round
1601284 eventually were going to get to bernard and wear him down i actually see this fight going like the one between miguel cotto and antonio margarito i called that one right i saw margarito as the stronger guy the aggressor the guy who kept coming forward and throwing nonstop punches
1601285 look the rings only so big bernard is a master of defense but i dont see him withstanding what kellys going to put on him for 12 hard tough rounds at some point hes going to crack and then well have him
1601286 im looking for kelly pavlik to bring his a game and im going to come with mine
1601287 this is the best fighting the best kelly pavlik didnt have to take this fight and i didnt have to ask for it so lets do it
1601288 as far as im concerned this is like two blue collar guys construction workers fighting over the last sandwich after a hard 9 hours of work
1601289 a w is a w getting a win over bernard hopkins is a great accomplishment do we want to win convincingly yeah but i really dont think theres any pressure on me i know im going to win
1601290 i think i speak for everyone here when i say huh
1601291 ill watcher your butt lady your grammar is not so much
1601292 il test stato eseguito il 23 luglio e abbiamo inviato i campioni a parigi per le analisi

1601297 we didnt have an estimate for new aids cases before
1601298 we know that science based prevention interventions and testing work to help to prevent the spread of hiv
1601299 however our prevention efforts must be adequately funded and vigorously applied and newly diagnosed individuals must get into care and treatment
1601300 just riding in a few hours ago i had my window down and it didnt feel that bad
1601301 being able to start work on the park is a dream come true
1601302 i am so excited for the residents because it means that we can take a major step forward in providing facilities that they have wanted and needed for a long time
1601303 taken as a whole the proposed agreement vests golden leaf with such involvement and decision making power over the details of the project that it ceases to be a grant supporting independent objective work and analysis
1601304 having carefully considered the provisions of the proposed agreement we have concluded that it would not be wise or appropriate for the north carolina biotechnology center to proceed
1601305 our board was supportive of an impartial and factual education program
1601306 the grant would have supported activities consistent with that purpose
1601307 a lot of environmental activists still have not come to accept that the humans are also part of the environment
1601308 we need your help to get this film into theatres and schools across the country to defeat al gores lies and exaggerations
1601309 not evil just wrong is the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see

1601314 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1601315 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1601316 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1601317 this is no fantasy no careless product of wild imagination no my friends these indictments that i have brought to you today specific charges herein against the individuals their acts of treason their ultimate aim of sedition these are matters of undeniable fact i ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused
1601318 my heart goes out to the families of the victims as well as to the community and the whole u p i was raised in the up and i know how much we yoopers value the serenity and safety that goes with living there when i was a kid we didnt even have a lock on our front door it wasnt needed and were not talking that long ago this kind of senseless act will bring the community together but will also leave scars that will make people think twice about their safety
1601319 i demand to know where al gore is declaring that this rise in the lake levels is all just media bunk and that were all still doomed because of global warming
1601320 he wants to tax oil companies profits which will raise the price of gas and use the money to help motorist pay for the more expensive gas is this robbing peter to pay peter
1601321 like any dog this breed needs to be matched with the right owner i dont know much about this specific owner or the circumstances but pit bulls are often a thugged out status symbol and are not given the assertive leadership they require heck it may have to come to the point where one needs to be licensed to own certain breeds banning them may only increase their mystique and status amongst those ill equipped to care for them
1601322 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
1601323 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
1601324 as a great admirer of the royal family i was disgusted to see that two of the animals in
1601325 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause in the future catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
1601326 an overwhelming number of scientists have determined that catastrophic manmade global warming is real and that any further debate over the science is pointless
1601327 marketed not on the basis of science its about what is known or what can be proved about the natural world rather than the number of scientists who are willing to publicly commit to a particular opinion
1601328 an overwhelming number of scientists they are referring to scientists working under the auspices of the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that agrees man made greenhouse gas emissions are or will in the future wreak havoc on the climate
1601329 head counts of scientists seem to be the name of the global warming game
1601330 the white house has taken a beating over the years in the press on climate and facts no longer matter
1601331 the latest move was to list the polar bear as an endangered species
1601332 there are many more polar bears today than 40 years ago and predictions of the bears demise are entirely based on politically inspired speculation
1601333 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect other countries to say ok
1601334 regulate the pantries of america as well as thermostats and modes of personal transportation mccain and the bush administration are drinking the same kool aid the initial response from the bush administration to relevant new facts seems to be see no consensus hear no consensus speak no consensuses
1601335 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1601336 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1601337 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1601338 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1601339 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1601340 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1601341 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1601342 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1601343 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1601344 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1601345 firme anti governo gelo nel pd dopo bassolino no di cacciari
1601346 pena di morte schiaffo del texas alla corte internazionale dellaja
1601347 it was the first day in pads and to be honest it was the first day i have been disappointed with the energy effort and enthusiasm that we had
1601348 the far more pressing problem theyve got is that the financial freeze has just not thawed out
1601349 while they talk kind of tough on inflation theyre very mindful that the real risk is that the economy will get weaker
1601350 is likely to have profound effects on chases operations and financial results
1601351 it is sad to see so many people victimized by a law which has no justification there is no reason why people should be in prison for cannabis cannabis is a wonderful herb which is loved around the world many people of all ages gain relief thanks to marijuanas therapeutic effects this medicine should not be denied to healthy people let alone sick and pain stricken individuals thankfully the tide is turning and the cannabis laws are rapidly becoming an ass those with the courage to come out of the grow closet and bring cannabis culture out into the public arena deserve a lot of respect for they are rapidly making the cannabis laws unworkable
1601352 four twenty protest groups have shown a friendly and responsible attitude towards the public clearly cannabis users are not the criminals they were once supposed to be but rather a legitimate sub culture that deserves the rights of ordinary citizens these social gathering would be ideally accommodated by cannabis caf proposals made by the alcp under alcp policy adult customers would be able to buy small amounts of cannabis subject to gst from licensed caf outlets
1601353 i am excited to be contesting this seat and i look forward to meeting many supporters of cannabis law reform over the next six months i was very pleased to see that pete hodgson legalized medicinal marijuana during this term of parliament if elected to parliament i will look to build on this success
1601354 these are very strong teams and they have the commitment to meet our aggressive schedule and help these two important roads become reality
1601355 its a matter of integrity and doing what we say were going to do
1601356 the consequence could be that a citizen could bring some sort of legal action to stop them from doing it
1601357 right now as a county commissioner i get what all the employees get
1601358 its not like i was asking them to give me the 200 bucks a month
1601359 if i try to buy an individual policy with pre existing health conditions i couldnt do it
1601360 if its illegal the department of justice has to stop it or get the legislature to pass a law and make it legal
1601361 it always sort of bugged me that they thought they were better than every other political official in north carolina
1601362 dangerous careless and reckless with the car going off the road at points
1601363 i thought i was going to die that this is my last minute
1601364 if we continue on this trend its going to be a big problem
1601365 it takes a lot more than just doing the test
1601366 gerard mcdonnell status unknown we have not heard or seen anything from gerard
1601367 i understand that many died and that only a few made it down
1601368 to try to help to save the others i froze my feet and hands
1601369 but instinct makes you want to save them and for me thats a good thing
1601370 this isnt going to be a prototype just plopped down in raleigh is it
1601371 why no its going to be a unique hotel designed just for raleigh good question
1601372 shape matters a lot in biology weve known that for years
1601373 there are a lot of chemotherapy drugs that are really toxic to the heart or the kidney
1601374 by controlling the size and shape we should be able to de target these organs
1601375 this is important for environmental scientists drug designers oncologists dermatologists inhalation any number of fields
1601376 nobody else is doing this its a huge unmet need
1601377 their small size means that they can get to places that other things cant
1601378 particles taken in a dietary supplement could end up in the brain or the placenta we just dont know
1601379 aluminum in ordinary amounts is something we use every day but nano sized aluminum is highly explosive
1601380 weve never had a broad technology that did not have some adverse consequences
1601381 right now we just dont know enough to say what the consequences could be
1601382 its exactly the role of the council to overrule him in a case like this
1601383 i do believe he ought to put more money into this project to show his sincerity that hes going to get it done
1601384 i think we need to honor the original request and let him pay for the traffic improvements when he pays for the land
1601385 i think this is going to be a great project and im glad the council is eager to work with us
1601386 on one hand perdue denounces the presence of outside groups and denies having any involvement with them
1601387 at the same time the party she controls is taking huge contributions from the donors running the ads
1601388 taking campaign finance advice from pat mccrory and his allies is like taking economic policy advice from george bush
1601389 i guarantee you african american turnout if im the nominee goes up 30 percent around the country minimum
1601390 its a great ruling for the teachers and the state employees
1601391 it essentially says the government cant use the pension fund as a rainy day fund
1601392 for the court to say the governors action was not necessary is not only legally wrong but mathematically impossible
1601393 instead of seeking a tax increase or cuts in other state programs that did not enjoy special constitutional protection defendants diverted the employer contributions to the retirement system
1601394 keeps retirement funds where they should be with retirees who have dedicated their careers to serving the public
1601395 theres no mind control or anything that looks good on a hollywood screen
1601396 really people make it out to be much more sinister than it is
1601397 the ability to get what you want by attraction rather than deception
1601398 if you mislead people or use propaganda and lose your credibility you lose your ability to attract
1601399 theyre honest young soldiers trying to do the right thing
1601400 the fact that they are genuine and understand they are in someone elses home makes them invaluable were trying to get people not to pull that trigger
1601401 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1601402 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1601403 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1601404 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1601405 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1601406 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1601407 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1601408 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1601409 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1601410 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1601411 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1601412 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1601413 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1601414 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
1601415 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
1601416 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
1601417 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1601418 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
1601419 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1601420 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1601421 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1601422 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1601423 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1601424 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1601425 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1601426 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1601427 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1601428 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
1601429 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
1601430 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
1601431 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
1601432 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1601433 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1601434 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1601435 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1601436 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
1601437 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
1601438 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1601439 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
1601440 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
1601441 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
1601442 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
1601443 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
1601444 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
1601445 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
1601446 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
1601447 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
1601448 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1601449 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1601450 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1601451 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1601452 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1601453 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1601454 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1601455 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1601456 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1601457 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1601458 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1601459 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1601460 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1601461 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1601462 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1601463 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1601464 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1601465 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1601466 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
1601467 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1601468 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1601469 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1601470 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
1601471 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
1601472 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
1601473 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
1601474 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
1601475 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
1601476 we felt the vote totals reported by yahoo did not reflect all the votes that should have been cast
1601477 we asked broadridge financial to double check the votes transmitted to yahoo on our behalf
1601478 it was just in this one incident with one investor and did not change the outcome of this election
1601479 failed to prove that apollos actions caused investors to suffer any harm
1601480 the large multinationals and financial institutions which were the first ones to decline almost a year ago in terms of their spending with us now are doing dramatically better

1601485 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1601486 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe
1601487 the carbon free home 36 remodeling projects to help kick the fossil fuel habit
1601488 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1601489 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1601490 yes there are problems but that does not mean those problems are going to continue
1601491 in all developing countries you put objectives and sometimes you dont reach them
1601492 they are determined to spend this money on development they see it as a priority
1601493 customer demand is strong we have a fantastic team and now weve got money
1601494 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
1601495 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
1601496 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
1601497 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
1601498 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
1601499 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
1601500 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
1601501 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
1601502 if the vice president says its do able i believe
1601503 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
1601504 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
1601505 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
1601506 los grupos general motors y ford se encuentr ferrovial consigue el apoyo para iniciar la refinanciaci n d
1601507 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
1601508 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1601509 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
1601510 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
1601511 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
1601512 when dealing with people let us remember that we are not dealing with creatures of logic we are dealing with creatures of emotion creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity
1601513 i went wow this is a great way to start this defensive campaign

1601521 think of mobileme as exchange for the rest of us now users who are not part of an enterprise that runs exchange can get the same push email push calendars and push contacts that the big guys get
1601522 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1601523 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1601524 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1601525 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
1601526 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
1601527 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
1601528 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
1601529 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
1601530 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

1601567 i would say i dont think it will be long term because i see how different i feel now from the day it started getting worse
1601568 i feel much better now so i dont think it will be too long i hope
1601569 im just going to get after it and go as hard as i can for as long as i can
1601570 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1601571 the white house had concocted a fake letter from iraqi intelligence chief tahir jalil habbush to saddam hussein backdated to july 1 2001
1601572 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohamed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
1601573 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1601574 some circumstantial evidence is very strong as when you find a trout in the milk
1601575 embargoes are contrivances designed not to protect the contents of the book but to create a media feeding frenzy when a book comes out often the entire purpose is to protect some kind of exclusive arrangement with a particular news outlet thats not about news its about publicity and it implicates the news media as part of the publicity juggernaut reducing us watchdogs to lap dogs
1601576 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
1601577 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1601578 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1601579 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1601580 are you on drugs you must be on something ive never ever heard anything so preposterous
1601581 no we dont take any drugs we dont need that nonsense because we chant hare krsna and what i suggested you should all seriously consider you can even chant with us if you like during your lunch break
1601582 yes we havent got all day just give me his name

1601584 an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law anyway the prison authorities never separate us and locked us in the same cell we chanted with our fingers like the way we do the gayatri mantra because they had confiscated our beads however they did allowed us to keep our devotee clothing i scratched on the wall krishnas devotees were hear chant hare krishna and be free within an hour food was pushed through a small opening at the bottom of the door knowing our vegetarian diet they presented us with boiled potatoes peas beans and pumpkin with an added written note from the prison cook blessed food we put the food aside and refused to eat it in the meantime back at the temple cittahari and sanaka prabhus were getting phone calls from the media and were told that as long as we are in jail we would protest by fasting the interested by the media was very supportive also believing it was unjust to throw us in jail for something we strongly believed in agreeing with cittahari that there was no harm to anyone chanting hare krsna on the streets for the first time our imprisonment attracted the attention of the public the next day an article appeared on page three a stand out page in all newspapers with the heading in the meantime at the jail we were escorted down for breakfast which turned out to be a little comical radio talk back been debating our plight and many prisoners had listened to this on the prison radio so on seeing us nearly all of them stood up in a tongue in cheek jester of respect with some saying in a singing mood hare hare krishna krishna with a few imitating our dancing again kurma and i refused to eat breakfast and offered it to other prisoners with a quick hare krsna offering before giving it to them the food hall full of prisoners then went into a roar with prisoners cheering some again singing krishna krishna it maybe hard to believe with hardened criminals bbut no one was rude to us or offended or threatened us while we were in prison so for the few days the prison guards just kept us in our cell only bringing us out for breakfast and lunch which we refused at night our supper was pushed through the opening in the bottom of the door always with the written note blessed food
1601585 madhudvisa is going to be furious we broke the fast
1601586 my son is a student at rmit and often visits gopals restaurant i dont think im a bad person i was just doing my job you know i did read some of those books we confiscated and also heard your spiritual leader speak at the melbourne town hall it took me awhile to understand but i now see his teaching are giving direction and understanding to so many young people today who follow his example
1601587 things are getting bad when you cant practise your religion
1601588 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1601589 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1601590 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1601591 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1601592 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
1601593 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
1601594 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
1601595 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
1601596 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
1601597 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
1601598 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
1601599 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1601600 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1601601 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1601602 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative

1601607 much of the recent increase in the fertility rate is likely to reflect the fact that over the last few decades younger women postponed childbearing and many are now having those postponed babies
1601608 targeted video games can help improve the lives of young people with cancer most importantly improve their adherence to their treatment
1601609 theyre kind of a tough group that gets a little bit lost in the system
1601610 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1601611 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1601612 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1601613 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1601614 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1601615 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1601616 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1601617 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1601618 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1601619 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
1601620 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
1601621 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
1601622 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1601623 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
1601624 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
1601625 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
1601626 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
1601627 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1601628 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1601629 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
1601630 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
1601631 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
1601632 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
1601633 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
1601634 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
1601635 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
1601636 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
1601637 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
1601638 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
1601639 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1601640 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
1601641 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1601642 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1601643 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
1601644 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
1601645 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
1601646 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
1601647 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
1601648 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
1601649 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1601650 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1601651 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
1601652 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
1601653 todays move means that symptom free people diagnosed with chlamydia and their partner will be able to get convenient effective treatment from their local pharmacy
1601654 the mhra is keen to support the availability of more medicines over the counter where it is safe to do so and we wish to move on to new areas such as prevention and chronic disease management
1601655 we respect your choices we regard your differences as part of our pluralist democracy it is our responsibility to safeguard this richness
1601656 we will press ahead with reforms and the economic development that we have been following so far
1601657 in our struggle against separatist terrorists we are determined to take every step at the right time
1601658 we will continue our determined struggle against every threat against the security of our people

1601665 come tradurre in parole comprensibili si chiede in un intervento del 4 dicembre 1968 le verit religiose come conservare al dogma cristiano la sua intangibile ortodossia e rivestirlo dun linguaggio accessibile agli uomini del nostro tempo come mantenere gelosamente lautenticit del messaggio della salvezza e come insieme farlo accogliere dalla mentalit odierna

1601671 whichever way we look at the numbers we come inevitably to the conclusion that australia like many other developed countries has taken its eye off the engineering ball
1601672 radical action is needed to improve the science engineering technology and mathematical literacy of students if we are to increase the numbers of domestically trained engineers
1601673 from the latest data we have been able to get hold of fewer than 12 per cent of all year 12 students in australia study advanced maths 66 per cent do not study either advanced or intermediate maths and the same proportion give physics and chemistry a wide berth
1601674 if governments continue to ignore the evidence the current shortage of 28 000 engineers will more than double in the next 10 years or so
1601675 the result will be that infrastructure programs promised by governments will not be delivered australias desperate water situation will remain unaddressed and engineering solutions to combat the effects of climate change will not be developed

1601690 they are primarily for the industry as a whole rather than the success or otherwise of tourism australias marketing activities

1601696 but as with many things in life there are people who seek to take advantage of these systems and are now committing crimes on the internet that are affecting each and every one of us in different ways
1601697 the internet provides an opportunity for criminals to commit crimes undetected with a level of anonymity that previously they would not have had available to them
1601698 we really have to think about what we have online and how were protecting it
1601699 cyber criminals are becoming quite skilled in planning and executing their attacks
1601700 there is no doubt that technology has the ability to increase economic growth
1601701 there is some indirect evidence that women have greater longevity after a marriage ends by becoming a widow or getting a divorce

1601706 are still making noise about our reinsurance program but i ask just what is our incentive for buying reinsurance other than to protect our policyholders we do not make any profit from purchasing reinsurance
1601707 when you look at the expansion of programs nursery services membership and staff its easy to see that we have grown and expanded in every way
1601708 along with that our commitment to the members and the community continues to grow
1601709 membership volunteers staff and a commitment to the community are all part of the ongoing success of the ymca in plant city
1601710 the mission of the ymca is to put christian principles into practice through programs that build a healthy spirit mind and body for all
1601711 we give people of all ages abilities and ethnicities a place to socialize meet friends while making new friends a place for seniors to stay mobile a place for the injured to get back on their feet a place for families to spend time together and needed time away
1601712 volunteers are the pulse the beating heart of the ymca not only locally but internationally
1601713 parents of our youth programs seniors who participate in dance and walking programs and others who can share their skills and time at the y or in the community are recruited as volunteers
1601714 and its important to have a strong board of directors who participate in the y and see firsthand the benefits and problems each program might face
1601715 this board is strong enough and informed enough to make the tough decisions
1601716 for one thing we know that a not for profit organization like the y cant exist for long by running in the red we have to be selective and careful in supporting programs that do not meet the minimum standards we set out to maintain
1601717 scotts input has been instrumental in the development of a program that is diverse and inclusive in nature membership is available to all individuals and families regardless of their economic standing programs are designed to encourage members to continue their participation and involvement at the y
1601718 people go there to have fun improve their mental and physical being for the fellowship and to stay in touch i go there about five times each week i go through the exercise routines but im there to meet people talk with them and have a good time
1601719 all the things needed for success of any business exist at the y there is open communication between management the staff members and volunteers there is an obvious climate of fellowship within the y and recognition of the positive role played by each and every staff member

1601738 afmatningen betyder at vi oplever et fald i vores oms tning og dermed indtjening inden for handel med v rdipapirer og oml gning af realkreditl n men da vi til stadighed f r nye kunder vinder vi det vi mister i gebyrer ind p for gede nettorenteindt gter s godt og vel endda

1601745 its an effort to try to stigmatize contraception and family planning
1601746 it should be a clarion call to women and men in this country that a kind of extremist view has begun to take hold to make even birth control and contraception more difficult to secure and that it could lead to the same kind of stigmatization that has existed in the case of abortion

1601789 the u s department of energy accepted the rice teams application to design build and operate a solar powered home using 100 000 in doe money
1601790 about 20 students from rices engineering and architecture departments make up the team instead of building a standard house though the rice team will design and build a house for project row houses a houston neighborhood art and cultural organization in the third ward
1601791 a biennial event the solar decathlon brings together 20 teams in a competition to design build and operate the most attractive and energy efficient solar powered house each teams house which must measure 800 square feet in size and use only sunlight for power is then assembled as part of a weeklong competition and exhibition in washington d c as part of a solar village on the national mall the university teams houses showcase innovation in solar technology to the general public while concurrently being evaluated for the decathlon the houses are judged and scored during this period in 10 different areas related to design energy efficiency and comfort an overall winner considered to have the most energy efficient and innovatively designed house will be announced at the end of the event
1601792 a team from three canadian universities including ryerson is among 20 finalists in an international competition to build homes run only by solar power

1601798 i thought he was magnificent in the five years he gave to england it was very sad for all of us to watch on sunday as he gave his resignation speech and we all felt for him
1601799 a lot of the guys in our side have sent messages to him congratulating him on the job he did he really was a fantastic leader
1601800 all the guys are really looking at this as the start really
1601801 this has been a hugely significant result for us and they all want to be part of it going forward
1601802 if they keep up the standard they have been giving us there is no reason why they cant be part of the future
1601803 for us to be 2 0 coming into the last test is amazing i never thought in my wildest dreams we would be coming to the oval and it would be a dead rubber game

1601809 i am elated to have won because it was a strong field with a collection of proven contenders
1601810 the tide has been ripping three knots taking us all over the line
1601811 but you have to be on the line to be first at the mark so it is really touch and go as to whether you are over or not we actually thought we were over and were sweating the whole race thinking that it might not count
1601812 on the last beat we stuck it into turbo and got lucky winning by about ten boat lengths
1601813 things were really close up by the forts and we were within half a boat length from ran and panthera were half a boat length behind the four boats were within three boat lengths in the lighter winds it is always going to be close but their programme is a very professional one while i have mates from work on board but it was great fun
1601814 the guys on ran sail the boat very well yesterday we trawled our kite and the day before we got something round the rudder but today we were luckier
1601815 we will be doing our best to win this week we are good in the wind and the forecast is for more wind but it is still a big hill to climb
1601816 we were coming down off the green running down towards the finish line and had a bit of a broach unfortunately sgt pepper was on our windward side and we went straight up into them
1601817 we were doing top speed and just had a wipe out broach there was nothing they could do really and they dragged our pulpit couldnt get off and eventually the side of the boat gave way the hole is above the waterline the inshore lifeboat was on standby but as long as we kept the boat heeled over we werent taking on water
1601818 get an outside spot in the laser sb3 boat park so you can get out quickly
1601819 we were blocked in and only got out to the start ten minutes before the gun so we found a different parking spot last night and had 45 minutes before the start so we got our bearings which made all the difference we were at the buoy end gybed away immediately and got into clear air quickly
1601820 that could count against us in the long run because some of the guys in the class are very experienced so when the conditions change they will know how to set up their rigs a little better and how the boats will respond so they may well be more consistent over the week but i would like to think we will be competitive from now on
1601821 we are political prisoners we will not let our freedom of expression be violated on this issue our opponents are only heaping coals on our fire they are concerned about children being exposed to cannabis users they should be concerned about a generation growing up feeling alienation towards the authorities

1601823 its a scary amount of power for any governor to have
1601824 the principles above and many more apply not only to science but wherever a point is being made
1601825 making research discoveries in the lab is the critical first step in any health breakthrough its the equivalent of striking gold but right now many of those discoveries dont make it the next step of being
1601826 usually this is because taking that knowledge through the different exploration phases that might lead to a new medical treatment is costly and risky this new centre aims to turn that around and we are very grateful to wesfarmers for their commitment
1601827 this centre is going to help us build a bridge between cutting edge medical research discoveries made right here in our own backyard to the patients who need it offering real solutions to some of the serious health problems in our community
1601828 wesfarmers contribution to this major link in the medical research chain is commendable and a great example of their commitment to the state and wa corporate sector generosity id like to see this great effort lead the way to bigger and better collaboration between the health and corporate sectors
1601829 its very exciting that waimr now has the funding to focus on this important area known as translational research as this is where well be able to make the biggest in roads that can improve peoples health
1601830 without translational research professor ian frazers idea that it might be possible to create a cervical cancer vaccine may have stayed just that an idea so this centre is clearly very significant and will allow wa scientists to ask the
1601831 research that leads to a better understanding of how to diagnose treat and prevent these three diseases and in the process rapidly translating this research into patient treatment has the potential to make a profound and positive impact for many people not only in australia but around the world

1601837 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and finance needs
1601838 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1601839 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1601840 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1601841 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1601842 to assume were going to pay for it all is just wrong
1601843 nonetheless the pace of spending has been held back by various factors including deficiencies in capacity and security

1601845 picture quality is generally good but perhaps a little disappointing given the overall quality of the camera as i mentioned earlier the lens is very good producing very little wide angle distortion and excellent corner to corner sharpness with only a tiny hint of chromatic aberration at the far corners of the frame

1601847 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1601848 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law

1601862 it heralds the start of a new era for the royal flying doctor service which celebrates its 80th year of service to the community this year
1601863 we are acutely aware that the rapid expansion of communities in regions such as the pilbara kimberley and gascoyne has created an urgent imperative for a faster more direct medical retrieval service

1601875 we are fortunate in having a high calibre candidate like van kralingen to take up this challenging new position
1601876 these two complimentary facilities provide us the flexibility to execute on larger mass market retail orders we have been receiving and to comfortably meet the strong demand we have seen building for the second half of the year
1601877 the prospect of a cycle of interest rate cuts going forward has really propelled the market on quite well
1601878 the turn comes later and closer to the end of the cutting cycle
1601879 historically the trigger point is earnings revisions beginning once the cycle becomes more positive
1601880 the strong growth in profits reflects both the buoyancy of the western australian economy and the major internal improvements made by the company in the past year

1601882 we want candidates with criminal records to be barred from contesting elections for that the government has to pass a law which has not been done yet there is a need to do a lot more to see that criminals are barred from elections
1601883 i feel it is on the decrease because of certain measures taken by the commission like compulsory filling of affidavits by candidates about their pasts

1601898 it is clear that the downturn has been exacerbated by the impact of this unfair tax hike and the industry has significant concerns that orders will continue to be affected in coming months
1601899 if this situation continues the government will not receive the additional revenue it had projected and there is a real risk that it will cost jobs
1601900 in these circumstances one would have to question why the government would pursue this tax increase

1601926 there is a responsibility on this generation to provide for future generations this is the time to do it and water is one of the key issues

1602007 nos propusimos analizar en qu condiciones crece nuestro parque automotor y lamentablemente encontramos que los veh culos m s vendidos ofrecen muy poca seguridad
1602008 en argentina la ley s lo obliga a las terminales a incluir cintur n y apoyacabezas y lo dem s es opcional y en muchos casos no puede sumarse siquiera pagando extra en otros pa ses el airbag y el abs tambi n son obligatorios
1602009 informe que intenta hacer creer que vendemos porquer as y no es as todos los autos 0 kil metros que se venden en argentina son seguros muchos no tienen tecnolog as de ltima generaci n pero cumplen con todos los requisitos que la ley impone
1602010 a su vez existe algo que se llama demanda la gente cuando pregunta por opcionales pide llantas de aluminio o reproductor de mp3 no pide airbags la gente opta por las versiones m s econ micas y privilegia el confort y la est tica a la hora de sumar algo al auto base
1602011 a todos nos gustar a poner airbags abs y dem s pero como son productos opcionales con poca demanda son caros y adem s la gente no los solicita uno tiene que hablar de entre 3 y 4 mil pesos para sumar airbag a un auto si fuera obligatorio y tuvi ramos que comprar cientos de miles el precio bajar a y su incorporaci n no tendr a tanto impacto en el precio final
1602012 el segmento del mercado en el target medio alto la gente quiere confort prestaciones y seguridad y est dispuesta a pagar por eso pero cuando se mira el segmento de autos chicos las limitaciones presupuestarias obligan a optar y en ese marco la gente todav a prioriza los aspectos que tienen que ver con el confort

1602188 there is a lot we dont know about but this much seems clear from the many reports google isnt making a phone it is developing an open source cellphone operating system
1602189 htc is already planning to ship 50 000 google phone test units out to developers by the end of the year
1602190 in advanced talks with two top u s cellphone operators verizon wireless and sprint nextel corp about selling handsets tailored to its new mobile phone operating system people familiar with the matter said
1602191 google is in talks with verizon and sprint nextel about developing mobile phone software and services
1602192 verizon wireless spokesman jim gerace confirmed the companies have talked
1602193 an operating system would give google another way to profit from sales of mobile phones which outsold personal computers by more than 4 to 1 last year according to gartner

1602199 while many of the emerging third party developments will be pure and safe in nature the poor state of security throughout the mobile industry will literally put millions at risk
1602200 unclear how the new service would approach the issue of drm digital rights management
1602201 will have to overcome resistance from wireless carriers and deal with potentially thorny security and privacy issues
1602202 to loosen the grip wireless carriers have over the software and services consumers can access on cellphones

1602208 based on a number of factors such as cost reliability of the network the network load delay characteristics and the quality of the session bit error rates or packet loss
1602209 agitos executive team has as a strong background wi fi but little on the voice side and even less on the wireless carrier
1602210 there are already dual mode wi fi mobile phones on the market and agito is working with nokia siemens networks and microsoft in how its product the roamanywhere mobile router will work with those devices

1602220 the global economy is downshifting pretty quickly and its not an environment that is conducive to gains in commodities weve seen a pretty big pullback in commodities since the start of july
1602221 weve seen the price of oil increase sixfold in the last six years thats quite a run but its not sustainable because youre now seeing demand destruction
1602222 our sense is that most commodities have run their course and will be selling at lower levels this year
1602223 people are definitely in a cautious mode and no doubt there is concern going around the market but this is typically a period of doldrums
1602224 clearly the bellwether here is the u s economy and its impact around the world there are signs the global economy has shifted into a lower gear and thats affecting commodity prices but i still dont think weve seen the bottom for them

1602263 i usually fall asleep quite easily but its sort of a restless sleep where i get up once or twice and struggle to fall back asleep
1602264 i try not to think about it and just fall asleep but you cant help it knowing that tomorrow is the day tomorrow is the day that ive been waiting for the past four years then you start sleeping then you wake up because you have funky dreams or weird dreams
1602265 but sometimes for me when i dont sleep that good it gives me an extra little something im on the edge during the whole day because i didnt sleep very good its not a bad thing necessarily
1602266 my brain goes like crazy and i think about the race and i think about the outcome which i shouldnt be doing

1602339 wagner had also used a horned helmet in the original production of tristan und isolde in 1865 this is even further from vikings because the story is a celtic not a germanic legend
1602340 the only major figure in the whole ring cycle who wore a horned helmet in the early productions was hunding wagner and his costume and set designer carl emil doepler probably borrowed the idea not from the few scattered images of vikings wearing horned helmets but from the costumes in stage plays about ancient pre viking germans

1602350 if you are 30 and your expenses are rs 20 000 a month and if inflation is a steady 6 per cent then when you retire at 60 your expenses will be about rs 1 20 451 a month just to maintain your current standard of living

1602401 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law

1602408 how was it that you found out my mom was pregnant
1602409 well your mom was taking these pills every time we had sex and since i pulled out everytime i thought i was in the clear
1602410 then one day your mom just told me i think im pregnant and then i said well i guess we are having a girl and you came out
1602411 and a lot of people have been telling me what it means everyone has a different take on it
1602412 if youre wondering there is a specific message we were trying to deliver but its a secret

1602420 the side deal merely aims to align the jpepa with the nationalist economic provisions of the 1987 philippine constitution it does not signify a real shift in the countrys economic strategies and merely asserts what is already formally contained in the charter
1602421 unfortunately these potentially important provisions have in practice not been able to hinder the unprecedented implementation of free market policies of so called globalization in the country and indeed have been observed more in the breach
1602422 a genuine partnership deal would have japan in solidarity with the philippines and giving real support for its development among others this means the philippines having open access to japan while still retaining its trade and investment protections the philippines maintaining its control over and capacity to regulate the domestic economy and japan providing untied financial aid and technical assistance that the philippines can freely use according to its development priorities
1602423 the jpepa signed by the government on the contrary is unequal defeatist and destructive and will remain so even with the side deal the only acceptable deal for the philippines is one based on the principles of solidarity mutual benefit and development

1602493 do you see the weakness in the zinc market as being abnormal and is it going to come back or it is just extra supply that is coming into the market
1602494 its a temporary event weve had some mines that have gone back into production that sort of filled the gap and those mines arent going to be operating for very long or at least that additional productions not going to be operating for very long so we do see it coming back and we do see the fundamentals for zinc continuing to be strong with the development of the just basic industrial development that you see in china and india and the rest of the world

1602501 i am not jose mourinho so why should people compare me with him
1602502 mourinho says i will win ten championships i dont say i will win ten i say i will try i am from the south of brazil and we are different there
1602503 we say we will try to win all the competitions we play in but ill never say i will definitely win this this or that never i will try im more modest
1602504 maybe if mourinho says he will win and then afterwards he doesnt that might cause problems because the manager is not playing its the players out on the pitch
1602505 so if you say that and they make a mistake then you have to say its their fault theyre the ones who are bad id never do that as manager you take on the responsibility
1602506 i want to make chelsea loved around the world like barcelona and manchester united its a surprise when people say chelsea are unpopular because when we went to china they cried for chelsea

1602518 is facing lots of difficulties and disadvantages because there are two different prices and two kinds of ocean freights in the iron ore import business in addition to a great demand for iron ore
1602519 the fast increase of price and ocean freight has threatened the smooth development of chinas steel and iron industry
1602520 we should make long term countermeasures at present the best method is to control the amount of ore imported thus to control the fast increase of steel and iron
1602521 because there are lots of unexploited mine resources in china some of them are not exploited because of low prices
1602522 have to strictly control the export of rolled steel especially the low end products to moderate export of high end products the price inversion of the at home and abroad steel are raising the price of ore and ocean freights it is also harmful for the present situation
1602523 in a move aimed at checking volatility in the spot market the government is planning to make it mandatory for miners to sign long term supply contracts with steel companies instead of selling at high spot prices
1602524 the committee of secretaries cos reviewing prices of essential commodities has decided that high grade ore especially lump would be provided at reasonable prices to steel producers to check metal price escalation ministries of steel mines and commerce will not take action to arrange meetings between iron ore miners and independent steel producers to facilitate preferential pricing formula and enforce long term contracts
1602525 the moratorium plan is completely absurd there is already a 15 ad valorem duty on ore exports and any further control would just kill the industry

1602784 awesome 1 1 11one 1 so far only martin in addition to myself has actually truly disliked it i was curious what other critical outlets shared this opinion so i ventured over to metacritic
1602785 i think a lot of things will be answered once we start playing im not concerned about playing time not concerned if i start thats the coaches job i just have to get myself the best prepared as i can
1602786 i cant speak for mr dumars but i definitely hope he sees in me what a lot of people dont see
1602787 a lot of people dont take pride in their defense and dont tip their hat to guys that go out and stick their nose in there and play hard on defense i think ive been one of the underrated defensive players in the league i think on this team ill have a chance to shine and thats exactly what this team needs every team doesnt need a big guy that plays defense and runs the court but this team happens to have that gap in the size they need
1602788 i can sit here and spill out all kinds of stuff injuries or what have you
1602789 but im not going to do that the past is the past im not going to disrespect my new organization by saying anything that sounds like an excuse this is a first for me i was able to pick and choose from a couple of different teams this is where i wanted to go and this is where i decided to be and this is my home now
1602790 im in the best situation ever im in a situation now where no one is expecting nothing i came into the league the no 1 draft pick now im on the different end of the spectrum
1602791 oh look mommy can you see the flea on the trapeze
1602792 democrats are in a very strong position to hold virtually all their seats while the republicans could readily lose most of theirs clearly the probability of a democratic takeover in november is more likely than not
1602793 a new variation in the attack on democratic war opponents as
1602794 whats not clear is that he has a strategy in iraq and to keep america safe
1602795 no one has misread history more than secretary rumsfeld especially when it comes to iraq
1602796 theres a golden opportunity for someone to step forward and take the lead on this
1602797 one thing about the democrats were always in disarray until about three weeks before the election thats nothing new but we usually seem to pull it together
1602798 our commanders and diplomats on the ground believe that iraq has not descended into a civil war
1602799 attacks and civilian deaths in iraq have risen sharply in recent months with casualties increasing by 1 000 a month and sectarian violence has engulfed larger areas of the country
1602800 remains potent and viable conditions that could lead to civil war exist in iraq specifically in and around baghdad and concern about civil war within the iraqi civilian population has increased in recent months
1602801 in other words theyve been lying even when the bushies switch into their pre election war of civilizations mode the happy talk continues
1602802 appears to have the least political authority since he came to washington party officials said
1602803 in many ways and to many people it was the day that changed everything
1602804 in this tragic moment the first thing that comes to mind is this we are all americans we are all new yorkers just as surely as john f kennedy declared himself to be a berliner in 1962 when he visited berlin
1602805 the rest of the trip we were showered with goodwill and sympathy switzerland italy spain and france
1602806 a deeply religious nation found prayer a source of comfort a deeply patriotic nation displayed the flag and sang the national anthem a generous nation donated to relief funds a majority of men and women in gallups september 14 15 poll said they cried
1602807 to this extraordinary change in public attitudes almost across the board on almost every subject to do with politics and even religion in the fall of 2001
1602808 polls show people dont mind the hassles and new security measures
1602809 whats happened is that 9 11 has changed the mindset we didnt get a spike in terrorism worries because people now see this is the world in which we live
1602810 they dont panic theres a sense that this is life today
1602811 the longest highest run of presidential job approval since modern polling began in the late 1930s
1602812 61 said to prevent future attacks americans should be active in world affairs there was strong support for our alliances there was really a lot of common views on these subjects
1602813 we essentially transformed our democratic convention into a vfw meeting
1602814 that would not have happened if not for 9 11
1602815 i think 9 11 made national security foreign policy a dominant issue in presidential races
1602816 i think iraq changed the criteria by which people evaluate what matters
1602817 it didnt take america five years to recover it was like a year
1602818 there was a temporary spike and people felt a little bit better about government after 9 11 but all those numbers have reverted to where they were before
1602819 thats not going to happen in the future the landscape has changed so much since then
1602820 a level of pessimism in american thats just not warranted say by the economic indicators
1602821 the public believes that the nations foreign policy should strongly take into account the interests of u s allies rather than be based mostly on the national interests of the united states
1602822 theres a real question in the survey research community and among political scientists about whether were seeing a new isolationism in the u s based on our awareness that were not very well liked
1602823 how common ground of 9 11 gave way to partisan split
1602824 was quickly swallowed up by a resurgence of partisan differences among voters and politicians
1602825 what began as a crystal clear fight against a small self contained group of murderers has become a kind of murky open ended world war iii in which the identity of the enemy is less certain and our allies seem to grow less reliable
1602826 a strategic error in focusing on democracy as the weapon to counter radical islam and terrorism
1602827 by making the establishment of democracy in iraq a precondition to other action the president has given control of the pace and direction of the war to the enemy
1602828 we are more divided and more partisan than ive ever seen us
1602829 its very difficult to keep that spirit after all people are human beings and prone to disagree
1602830 in a 50 50 america the lust for political advantage overwhelmed calls for consensus and cooperation

1602896 the players had malaria tablets and injections before we went to africa but wayne has come back and it has knocked him sideways he said
1602897 michael carrick has also had the virus but maybe he will get part of the game against portsmouth on sunday

1602899 im not getting into that because its finished hes staying here hes a manchester united player believe me

1602914 the reference to canada is fairly peripheral and embedded in a broad anti kufar non believer strategy targeting jews christians apostate muslim leaders and secular officials
1602915 the main interest in the story would seem to me the effort taken on some jihadi websites to try to encourage professionalism and clandestinity in terrorist operations
1602916 this is surely a response to the knowledge that home grown and loosely affiliated terror networks will normally be lacking in operational knowledge and experience especially around surveillance and security the website is another reminder that the internet is a powerful tool for jihad and al qaida and recognized by them as such

1602938 ive come with a message for you from the reverend stolz the car he and mr wurst were coming up in from oodnadatta broke down in the stevenson crossing north of the alberga on sunday morning the alberga had pretty well knocked the car out and the stevenson finished it off mr stolz was lucky enough to catch the camel mail from the oodna soon after the car broke down and he spoke to gus my husband over the phone as soon as he got to bloods creek this morning at half past nine when gus told him hed got a message from allan last night about your wanting to wait at idracowra mr stolz grew quite alarmed he wants you to come down to the bend immediately sos youll be on the overland telegraph line he said theres a doctor in oodnadatta at present and you could get medical advice from him or from the hostel by phone once you got to the bend but thats not all
1602939 mr stolz said he was arranging for a local car in oodnadatta to come up as far as the charlotte to take up the doctor himself and gus will bring on the doctor from there to the bend by buggy there shouldnt be any trouble as far as the charlotte most of the country up to there is as you know hard gibber country
1602940 do you think the local driver will do any better at the alberga crossing than mr wurst and what about all the rest of the creeks after the alberga what about the stevenson what about hamilton bore
1602941 mr strehlow the local drivers know how to handle all the creeks north of the oodna theyve had to cross them plenty of times when going over their station runs they arent newchums like the drivers from down south and they know the right places for crossing the creeks even mr wurst mightve got over those two crossings without doing in his clutch if hed had a better pilot than that chap jack fox he picked up in the oodna jacks all right when hes sober but i bet he was drunk when he left the oodna pub
1602942 heres our last suggestion as soon as gus heard that your horses were all knocked up he said to me ruby take our buggy horses and one of our boys to idracowra and bring mr strehlow down and take allans boys back as well and so we got the boys to round up six buggy horses and some saddle horses early this morning all the ones close to the station you know and after that the three boys and i got going we left a bit before eleven oclock this morning and its taken us seven hours to get here and now please listen to me you must come with us so please dont say no gus and i both know you cant stand the heat any longer so ill just have a quick cup of tea and a snack while the boys harness our horses to your buggy we could leave here in half an hour or so and travel right through the night it may take us thirteen or fourteen hours to get back to the bend for well have to go pretty slowly over those gutters in the table mountains therell be no moonlight tonight its almost new moon you know but well be close to the bend by the time the suns up and youll be sitting under a roof next to a phone before the day turns into another scorcher
1602943 youve been in the saddle for seven hours already you must be tired out you need a good nights sleep first
1602944 im only a girl you might say and the bush made me tough years ago i can see the distance out as well as any of the stockboys no we must go back tonight one of the boys and i will carry storm lanterns and ride ahead of the buggy all your driver has to do is follow the lights
1602945 itll be a bumpy ride through the table mountain country those gutters are pretty rough and storm lanterns dont throw much light but at least itll be cool and we can stop on the track and give you a spell whenever you want one so please come back with us wont you
1602946 you have been wonderful riding seven hours in this heat today yes ill come back with you if you think that you can ride all night as well and i dont know how i can thank you and mr eliott enough for what you have done for me
1602947 and now please excuse me i must rush out and organise everything as soon as everything is ready we must go it will be a long slow trail back and the sun is going to be up nice and early tomorrow morning
1602948 well heres ettie come to see you and your mother molly too
1602949 im going on to your old man to see if i can be of any use to him
1602950 ive got a bone to pick with you mr strehlow
1602951 now why did you camp here instead of coming up to the station i know our damn blockhouses cant compare with those big comfortable stone houses of yours at the mission but at least youd ve been camping a lot closer to us weve never had a chance of returning any of your mission hospitality before and now youre spoiling it all by stopping down at the waterhole with the cattle
1602952 im sure wed ve been better company for you than the bloody cattle
1602953 i could never be offended with you mr strehlow youve been far too good to me and my mate here and my whole bloody henbury tribe for donkeys years surely you mustve realised how much youve meant to us here and to the whole population of this country when i came to say goodbye to you at the mission a coupla weeks ago if youd arrived here a bit earlier id have got my donks to pull your buggy up to the old place for the night great animals for this country donks horses are all right for mustering and saddle work theyre no bloody good for pulling in sand thats why we use only donks for all our carting and yard building work and now while were talking about horses and donks tell me how many horses have you got with you and how have they been standing up to that finke sand this afternoon
1602954 its not my business to interfere with your plans mr strehlow but i know what the tracks like between here and idracowra if youve been finding the going tough this afternoon then youll be in a helluva mess if you try going over the britannia sandhills and those last bloody miles along the finke from hells gates to idracowra are not a bit better youve a buggy and a van and you dont seem to have more than one change of horses left for each in fact i may as well tell you that you havent even got one change left for either of them ive had a good look at your horses as i came past the waterhole and theres at least half a dozen of them that look like being buggered up altogether you might as well leave your knocked up horses right here that old van of yours has a helluva load on it and those narrow iron tyres of hers are going to cut into the sand like knives into runny butter youll find youll have to change your team after half a days pulling and youll need all whats left of your good horses just to hitch to the buggy theres no water in the britannia sandhills and theres about twenty two miles of them thats right isnt it alf
1602955 but of course theres an easy way out of that mess only you mustnt be so bloody stubborn this time in accepting a bit o help from your henbury friends now heres my plan first leave all your knocked up horses at the station with us they can be picked up when your buggy comes back next hook some of our donks to the van weve got plenty of em here and we dont need them at the moment my advice is that you go ahead in the buggy tomorrow morning and drive through to idracowra its fifty five miles away and itll take you all your time to do it in two days the van can follow at its own pace i can supply the donks to pull it and the donkey harness eight donks should manage to get your van through any amount of sand and ill send along another eight loose donks old bob and lornie can drive the team for you they know how to handle em now what dyou say to my proposition
1602956 and id like to do something for you in return
1602957 us tough bush people in these partsve always had an unwritten law of mateship and that law says that every man must help everyone else in trouble never mind whether the poor buggers been his pal or his enemy thats the only way us poor bastards up hereve been able to survive at all in this tough country weve no trains no cars no doctors no nurses and bloody little money and no man would ever take any money for helping someone that needed his help hed only expect to be treated the same way when he needed it himself now youre an old friend of the bush people and youve always been good to alf and me theres nothing either of us would accept from you even if you were in a position to offer us anything
1602958 but of course mr strehlow if you insist on giving us something then all id like to ask for would be something to remind us of you a sort of keepsake if you like what are you going to do with that nice upholstered chair youre sitting on if youre going to send it back with the buggy when you get down to oodnadatta then you might tell the boys to drop it in for us at henbury but of course if you intend taking it down south with you then just forget about it the henbury donks are on loan to you for nothing what dyou say alf agreed
1602959 of course bob only wish wed a car to offer but nobody owns one in this country too sandy for cars anyway and mr strehlow ill always remember what hermannsburgs done for my daughter elsie
1602960 just one more thing mr strehlow im sorry you had to leave hermannsburg in such a hurry that none of us bush folk had a chance of doing anything much to help you but i tell you this youve done a grand job at the mission every white man in the country will tell you that if you ask him as you know none of us poor bastards has much in the way of money but if we couldve had just one months notice before you left wed have tried our bloody best to get the money together somehow to hire a car to take you south your flash church cobbers should neverve asked you to go down in a buggy but then all them nasty southerners are alike under the skin they dont know what mateship is theyre only interested in squeezing the last penny and the last ounce of sweat out of whoever works for them and then they kick him out into the bloody gutter and spit on him after hes no more use to them well i must get going ive been talking too much but we dont often see any visitors at henbury the rich folk down south whatve squeezed tens of thousands of pounds out of henbury these last forty yearsve made sure wed never have any visitors coming to see us up here all we have at henbury is a couple of bloody log houses for camping in when were not out on the run
1602961 well come down to see you off in the morning
1602962 you cant leave idracowra in your buggy today your horses are knocked up and this hot weather knocks hell out of any man even if hes in the best o good nick tell you what ill do ill send two boys to horseshoe bend with a letter to gus telling him to send the car on to idracowra as soon as it gets to the bend his donks will take about six hours to pull the car over the finke and the box gum flats for the first twelve miles after that its hard solid going till the car gets here and our donks will pull it over to the station thatll let you have a spell here till the car comes the old blockhouse isnt much of a place to stay in but at least its solid and keeps you out of the sun
1602963 look its nothing what im doing everyone in this country would be only too glad to do the same for you im only sorry i cant do more

1602970 the finke is just on the other side of it and there is a large waterhole here the uratanga waterhole which the whites call salt hole
1602971 but the young folk of today insist on calling it the talpanama mountain that is because our young people spend all their time with the white folk and grow up just as ignorant as the white men otherwise they would remember that talpanama is the name of a clay flat north of the intjinjera waterhole where we will be stopping shortly for our meal that waterhole too the ignorant young people today call the talpanama waterhole

1602980 thats why this kind of thing is important so the kids can know the community know the resources available and to welcome the new neighbors
1602981 this lawsuit against santa clara demonstrates the cras ongoing commitment to establishing a flexible and reasonable statewide standard for nutritional information disclosure

1603005 weve got a helluva blow dryer in the next room
1603006 so you want to see the pictures ill tell you that was one hell of an operation
1603007 absolutely positive you dont seem a bit different from when you walked in
1603008 yes theyre both dears i dont know what i would have done without them all these years when sheila was born no one couldve been more proud of the baby than they were they treated her like their own child and they couldnt fuss enough around me
1603009 they took me out after rains and taught me all about bush foods the berries the yalka the yams and whenever any native game was brought in they always came along with some cooked meat for me too and i got to like it in the end
1603010 but i appreciated their help most of all when i first came to the bend i was just a young city girl from melbourne a real newchum girl frightened of centipedes spiders scorpions and snakes and there are plenty of those around here in summer particularly after good rains
1603011 i remember one afternoon some months after id come up having a bath in the rickety old bathroom off this verandah just some posts stuck in the ground and old packing case boards nailed to them the door was made of boards too and wouldnt shut properly just as i was standing up reaching for the towel hanging on the door i saw a big black snake wriggling underneath it i cant tell you what a fright i got id never seen a live snake in my life before i just stood there in the bath and screamed my head off as soon as i started yelling the men came rushing out from the hotel but when the first man pushed open the door he stopped in his tracks as though that snake had bitten him and he went back for his life no one else would come near me in the end vic heard me screaming one of the men told her what was going on i can still see her coming in at the door carrying a big waddy she knocked that snake cold in a jiffy then she took the towel off the door put it around me and gave me a good old scolding missy you no gottem shame standin dere and callin out like that till all dem men come along and see you standin dere naked in the barss why you no sing out longa me first time me bin feelum proper shame longa you but she wasnt really mad with me just thought that the missus shouldnt be seen like that by any of the hotel customers she was really sorry for me
1603012 ill say we have and the trouble is they can slip in under most of the doors in the hotel the kitchen and the dining room on a hot night youve got to take a light wherever you go or you might step on one of the blighters in the dark some of the men around here mightnt mind but i do and so do all the women tell you another snake yarn do you remember old fred freer
1603013 and in between the mail runs he was working here as the station cook well you know what old fred was like he hardly ever opened his mouth and nothing could shift him before he was ready about the slowest thing i ever saw in these parts and thats saying something but he was a good cook and he used to bake the loveliest bread i ever tasted now fred was a married man rare thing in this country and hed brought his wife up with him she hated the place and the bush and the folk up here and in the end old fred had to get back south though he didnt want to leave the bend mrs freer used to spend most of the day gossiping and at night shed sit up reading in bed with a kerosene lamp alongside of her one night she was reading in bed as usual when she saw a snake crawling in under the door fred she called out fred come here quick fred old fred was out in the kitchen kneading the dough his arms stuck in it right up to the elbows and old fred wasnt going to be disturbed he was proud of his bread and wasnt going to shift for anyone mrs freer kept on yelling fred quick come here fred i want you in the end even old fred couldnt stand all that yelling any longer i cant come he calls back im just setting the bread what is it mrs freer yells back fred come here quickly theres a snake in the room i cant come now he grumbles in that slow old way of his the snake will keep better still it might go out ill come in a minute mrs freer keeps quiet a few minutes then she starts yelling for fred again whats the matter now he calls back fred come quickly the snakes still in the room i can see it going under the washstand well put the light out and you wont see it he yells back after that he finished kneading the dough tucked it up in the dish with a blanket and put it next to the stove for the night after hed done everything as slowly as he could he went and picked up a stick the old snake was still crawling around in the room and fred knocked it over first hit mrs freer was just about having hysterics by then but fred didnt mind nothing could upset him if id been mrs freer i tell you idve crowned him good and hard
1603014 fancy being able to get away with a thing like that not many married men would ever try it out on their wives
1603015 there was no one who could shift fred as i told you before
1603016 neither man nor woman he just wasnt natural but he was a darn good cook and we were all sorry when she made him leave the country she was a match for him in one respect at least he couldnt get away from her
1603017 im surprised to hear you have so many snakes around here in summer
1603018 youve got only barren hills near the station and the finke over there hasnt many big gums in it where do all the snakes come from
1603019 and the finkes never looked so poor as regards gums till that last big flood came down in it beginning of last year when i first came here i often used to look at the beautiful big gums behind the yard and on the other side of the river at the road crossing and then the big rains came late in nineteen twenty the finke started running and so did the hugh and so did the palmer and so did all the creeks on the horseshoe bend run they all run into the finke above the bend and the finke ran past the station for more than six months id never seen so much water rushing past me all my life the first flood got down here about a month before christmas nineteen twenty and it wasnt till late last year that the last trickles stopped running between some of the waterholes that was after the set in the biggest flood came down in march last year i remember standing out in front of the hotel it had been pouring rain all night and all creeks and gutters on the run were running into the finke and the flood reached from near the top of the bank behind the stockyard up to the box gum flats on the other side about half a mile wide all of a sudden we could hear something come roaring down from the west like a real tornado it kept coming closer and all the people in the camp and everyone in the hotel rushed out to see what it was and then we saw it coming it was a shock wave of water about ten feet higher than the level of the flood when it reached the station the water went right through the yard and came up within half a chain of the hotel on the other side it spread right out as far as the sandhills the finke mustve been about a mile and a half or two miles wide at this stage down went all the big gums on both sides of the main channel at sundown the only big trees still standing were what was left on the flood flats thats why there arent any big gums left all along that horseshoe bend along the eastern side of the finke where the cliff walls are all you can see now are a few young gums growing up out of the sand but it will take twenty or thirty years before the finke is going to look nice again at the bend i dont think ill still be here to see it
1603020 ruby ill get those bottles up to old allan and bob with the next mail now about the men here im going to put aside a whole case of free whisky anybody thats here now and anybody that comes within the next fortnight is going to get a free drink at the bar ill tell them that all the grog came from mr strehlow but im only going to put a few bottles on his account it was a real fine gesture from the old boy to think of us like that of course its just the sort of thing one might have expected from him but im not going to take all that money from his widow shell need every penny she can hang on to the mission staff never got paid much its a bloody shame how little the old fellow got all his life but thats none of my business horseshoe bend can stand a case of grog easier than the poor old boys estate
1603021 well mates heres to mr strehlow a mans man like the rest of us
1603022 after the toast had been honoured with great fervour he continued
1603023 whodve thought a bloody parson wouldve left any money behind for blokes like us to wet our whistles with all the ones ive ever struckve been a mean lot of bloody wowsers like mack said yesterday theyd start sniffing you up and down like dogs with runny noses as soon as you started shaking hands with em
1603024 he was the absolute boss on that station of his make no mistake about that and yet all the niggers in the country trusted him and would do anything for him and parson or no parson the bush people too grew to respect him funny bloody thing come to think of it but he was honest he was dinkum he was a white man hed make any bush bloke welcome on the station this is a mans country every white man on his station is the king of all he surveys as the saying goes and the old boy was a mans man everyone in this country agrees on that
1603025 i just felt i had to ring you even though my husband and i had already sent you that wire last friday evening we still cant grasp whats happened your dear husbands death has thrown such a sadness into the police station and we dont seem to be able to throw it off to think that that was the end of the huge sacrifice of life that the dear reverend mr strehlow made i suppose its the will of god certainly beyond my understanding my husband and i cannot get over nor understand we will close the curtains on one of the best men in the country most conscientious in his work and life and respected by all
1603026 theres just one more thing that my husband wants me to tell you about its about the half castes here at the bungalow you know what a problem mrs standley and we are having with them the government certainly doesnt know what to do with them that is why my husband and mr urquhart called on mr strehlow last july when he was so ill your husband didnt see how he could take the half castes off our hands we feel now that he was too ill to listen to our plans but we hope to see the reverend mr stolz at the alice and we still hope the mission station will take them all they do no good here at the mission station they would at least learn to fear god and learn the higher ideals of life we trust that the mission will be pleased to take these poor foundlings the surroundings here are against them
1603027 im only sorry your husband wont be at hermannsburg if mr stolz does accept the governments plan it will be a long time before hermannsburg will see another man like mr strehlow
1603028 your father now rests with us here in the land of the aranda people and you too must return to us and to your own home of ntarea after you have finished your schooling
1603029 no man can escape a bullet thats got his number written on it
1603030 then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it
1603031 i think dick cheney summed it up very well in 04 when he got on television and said if john kerry is elected president well have another serious attack within the first year thats unbelievable demagoguery but its still worked it started in 2002 when they beat max clelland vietman veteran and triple amputee and they got the veterans to endorse chambliss against him which is kind of unheard of
1603032 negative impact of iraq is hurting not only bush but also the republican party as well
1603033 we know from the past that presidential approval does predict mid term election outcomes
1603034 collectively these numbers document one of the most pessimistic evaluations of the conflict weve found in the past two and a half years
1603035 a virtual campaign slogan repeated in interviews and tv ads
1603036 endangered candidates are presenting themselves as independent minded problem solvers who are not part of washingtons partisan wars
1603037 that lead is far bigger than anything since 94 it sure looks a lot better for democrats than the previous few rounds you would believe therefore that if democrats were within 15 seats before this with that big of a lead youd think theyd do well
1603038 the only thing the gop appears to have going for it right now is the fact that most voters have yet to tune in to the details of their upcoming electoral choices so if the republicans can just keep their heads down they might avert a fatal storm
1603039 and the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building
1603040 forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us
1603041 i have been waiting for you for many years you have come at last but it is too late
1603042 i am too weak to say more than a few words to you today i have been disappointed and very bitter during these last few weeks but there must be no words of anger between us we are both standing here in the sight of god let us do what he wants us to do
1603043 brother stolz for twenty eight years i have tried to be a faithful shepherd to gods congregation at hermannsburg
1603044 the finke river mission board knows that it is responsible to god for what happens to hermannsburg and i give you my full and loyal assurance that i as the chairman of the board will never allow the church to abandon hermannsburg so far as this lies in my power
1603045 i make this promise before god and now may god bless you for the loyalty you have shown to his cause during those twenty eight years in the heart of australia and may he be your help today and your comfort in the illness that has stricken you down
1603046 hes dead my carl is dead and i didnt even know that he was dying
1603047 your husband doesnt have to suffer any more he is at peace at last you must come away from here with me ive got a new room ready for you for tonight
1603048 he has always been so good to me oh what will i do without him please let me stay with him a little longer
1603049 there are lots of things that still have to be done for your husband we must get him out of the chair onto the bed and wash his body before it grows rigid but there are others wholl help me its better that you shouldnt be there when we do these things youd only be upset and youre completely worn out already youve nursed him all on your own for two months already and you need a break please do come with me now you can look at him again once everything is over and he is lying on the bed
1603050 i thought you might like to have somebody to talk to tonight in case you cant go to sleep in this heat
1603051 i have come to express to you my deepest sympathy in this grave hour i can do no more than commit you to the care of the lord who has promised to be the protector of the widows and the orphans he will comfort you and care for you
1603052 i just cannot understand it i did not know that my carl was dying it was just as though my eyes were being held shut so that i could not see anything and now he has gone i did not even tell him before he went how much i loved him the last words i said to him were spoken when i was so very upset and he did not reply to me
1603053 sister strehlow you have done the impossible for your husband for many weeks dont blame yourself now for anything that you didnt do i am sure that god himself in his mercy shut your eyes so that you could carry on as you did till this very hour
1603054 and now let me tell you what mrs elliot and i were whispering about just outside the door as your husband died she had received only a few moments earlier a telephone call from charlotte waters telling her that breadens car which was to bring the doctor up from oodnadatta had been held up by an unexpected flood in the alberga it could not hope to get through for several days perhaps even for a week depending on how quickly the alberga went down gus had rung to ask her about your husbands condition he wanted to know should he wait at charlotte waters for that time or not when mrs elliot told me this i knew that it was gods wish to call unto himself the soul of his weary servant and to give him his reward for his faithfulness unto death that was why all our little human efforts to intervene had to fail what has happened has been the will of the lord of life and death the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord
1603055 i shall try to accept gods will without arguing against him
1603056 only i still cannot grasp it o my carl i did not even know that you were dying why did you not take me with you o my god what is to become of me
1603057 it will mean your staying in australia for the time being but i will talk to you about that tomorrow when you have had time to rest and now heres your son i will leave you together and go
1603058 i only wish he had taken me with him to that peace that he has been granted at last
1603059 lazy station blacks watering a few cabbages in his garden
1603060 they are like the hammers of hell and nothing but a bullet will stop them
1603061 in the name of allah allah is the greatest of all
1603062 im afraid that i have far too often thought in the past that we who call ourselves christians were a superior folk to those who neither pray nor read the bible nor bother their heads about god and the life to come i have always striven to educate my flock to walk in what i believed to be the christian way of life but during these past weeks i have come to reassess some of my beliefs it is when you are down and out that you begin to think most clearly about the ways of men and the ways of god it was the publican who dared not lift up his eyes to god in the temple who went down to his house justified not the pious pharisee who had given thanks to god so arrogantly for being infinitely superior to all people whose lives were not as blameless as his own christ himself dined with the publicans and the sinners and the harlots with men and women who were regarded as renegades and outcasts by the pious sections of the community of his own day i am beginning to understand why he condemned the pharisees the most upright and fiery fundamentalists of his own day as a bunch of arrogant hypocrites and as whited sepulchres full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness and why he said to the chief priests and the elders of the people at jerusalem the publicans and the harlots go in to the kingdom of god before you piety without love is useless for god is love and these hard swearing hard drinking bush folk living with lubras whom they have not married are the people who are always ready to show love towards their neighbours when it is most needed again it was the priest and the levite that hurried away and left a badly injured fellow countryman lying in his blood and it was the outcast samaritan who picked him up and took him to an inn for medical help even though the injured man was his national enemy
1603063 kidman wont take on any man as manager who doesnt stand the treacle tin out in the sun for at least an hour before putting it on the kitchen table
1603064 in a quiet neighbourhood as far as blacks are concerned cattle spearing not being in vogue to any great extent there
1603065 soon after the moon has risen we have to go a long way yet through the sandhills before we get back to the finke tomorrow and the donkeys can have a drink and it will be night again tomorrow before we reach idracowra
1603066 the pioneers came to open up new country they brought their stock and they had to have labour not easy to get in those days i can tell you not one of the old niggersd work for them only some of the kids came along boys of fourteen and fifteen or less the pioneers would teach them to handle sheep then one day the old folkd come and tell them to run away now what could the pioneers do theyd got their holdings from the lands office in adelaide and were paying rent on them and anyway the niggers had never done anything with the land before the white man came into this country the police wouldnt help them in any way in fact lots of the settlers were too far out to call the police when trouble started so when the boys ran away all the settlers could do was to ride after them bring them back and give them a good hiding with a stockwhip to teach them they couldnt just walk out on their jobs and let the sheep get killed by dingoes or let them die without water after that the old niggersd start making trouble they didnt often attack the homesteads they usually started killing sheep or cattle and there was no way of catching them if the police came they were weeks late getting there and mostly they took no action unless you could tell them what niggersd done it as if any of the settlers wouldve known in any case there werent enough police in the whole of the bloody state to protect the poor battling cows in the outback from the thieving niggers in those days all the pioneers could do was to get together when things got too tough then theyd go out in parties and raid the niggers camps and knock the thieving bastards over with bullets never got very many of course bush niggersre pretty cunning and their camps were hard to find and theyd all run like rabbits if they saw a party of settlers coming up on horseback but after some years everything quietened down the niggers had enough sense to realize that they just couldnt walk around the country killing sheep and cattle and they got to respecting the white mans property they settled down pretty well after that and some of em worked jolly hard for the pioneers it was only during the first few years that things were really tough down in the flinders
1603067 a lot o good sheep country was ruined by ploughing and the wheat cockies never got a proper living out of it
1603068 those government blokes in adelaide shouldve had more sense than trying to get people to grow wheat at quorn hawker and other bloody dry places like that
1603069 men would not remain so many years in a country like this if there were no women and perhaps the almighty meant them for use as he has placed them wherever the pioneers go
1603070 i think i saw many more people here last time
1603071 that spanish influenza did it three years ago the blacks here died like flies and it was the same everywhere all the way down to oodnadatta
1603072 yes we heard about the oodnadatta epidemic from the kramers two years ago
1603073 mr kramer helped the police to bury the dead so many died that the rest all fled out bush and did not stop even to bury their relatives it must have been a terrible time
1603074 hundreds of them died within a few weeks at oodnadatta it was the same at all stations between there and here and nobodyll ever know how many died out bush after theyd rushed away from the stations ill tell you how bad things were at that time gus sent out old gallagher tom one of our best stockboys with five other boys to take some cattle down to the charlotte there was nothing wrong with any of them when they left and then ten days later old tom came riding back on his own with a couple o packhorses he was in tears when he walked up to gus he and the others had all caught the flu from some of the new crown boys the other five boys had died on the track and only old tom had managed to come back alive of course theyd lost the cattle and the rest of the plant and tom was frightened that gusd be wild with him but of course we only felt sorry for the poor old thing and for the other boys too a couple of them had been our very best stockboys old tom was ill for another month or so before he could come back to work but we got our horses and most of our cattle back at the next new crown muster
1603075 yes old tom pearce down at the new crown is a jolly good bloke
1603076 absolutely honest never played a dirty trick on anyone all his life he was one o the characters in mrs gunns we of the never never you know hes called mine host in that book
1603077 and is that why there are so few people here in the camp now
1603078 you see the blacksre dying out pretty fast everywhere in these parts when i first came up here as a young chap the whole country was just thick with blacks they were everywhere and it was pretty hard for a cattleman to keep his stock safe from their spears just let me give you an idea of what things were like then you could see big laughing camps of niggers beg pardon blacks in mobs of eighty or a hundred at every big waterhole along the finke river and they were just as thick along the palmer the lilla the goyder and even down at that godforsaken dump the charlotte well they never seemed to have many kids at least not after us whites came into this country and few of the kids they had ever lived long by the time the flu hit them there were no blacks living along the finke in camps of their own any more what was left of them had moved to the stations the flu just speeded up things like some folk down southre starting to complain that the early settlers mustve shot them in their hundreds but i tell you most of them just went off naturally no resistance just had no will to live it seems anyway the blacksve always been treated very well on this station and on most other stations on the finke as well
1603079 you and your husband must take most of the credit for that though i dont know how youve done it
1603080 its so good of you to say so my husband and i have just tried to do our duty and perhaps god has blessed our work
1603081 just think of it the doctor should be here by saturday afternoon everything will be all right after that he will be able to give you relief immediately and when you are stronger again we will be able to go on and this time in a car mr wurst is merely waiting in oodnadatta for new car parts and then he will make the second attempt to come here to horseshoe bend
1603082 please ask mrs elliot to come i want to talk to her and please understand me i want to talk to her alone
1603083 my husband wants to speak to you and he wants to speak to you alone i will wait here please go he is almost too weak to talk this afternoon
1603084 mr strehlow i believe you asked for me to come
1603085 yes mrs elliot i want to ask you to help me please
1603086 i am dying i have not many more hours to live
1603087 you are much stronger than you think gusll bring the doctor back by saturday afternoon and after that everything will be all right with you
1603088 i know that i am dying and i think you know too and so does your husband but my wife does not and she must not be told i want her to have peace while i am still alive i am afraid that she will break down completely when im gone it will be hard on her she has always relied on me in everything she will not know what to do once she is a widow
1603089 please mrs elliot comfort my wife when im gone only a woman can understand a womans grief i am glad that i will die at a place where there is a woman to comfort my wife and please help her and my son to get down safely from here to oodnadatta all our horses are knocked up many of them have already been left behind and my wife will need supplies for the road i can no longer attend to anything
1603090 gus and i will look after everything if anything happens well let you have fresh horses from the bend for a start and therell be the car to take your family down from the charlotte gusll look after the supplies from the store so please dont worry about what might happen to your family gus and myself and all the other station people between here and oodnadatta will look after them everybodyll treat them like their own folk and in any case im sure the doctor will still be able to pull you through when he comes
1603091 and heres my last request mrs elliot you and your husband and all the station people along the finke have been so very good to us but i am not leaving much money behind and i cant do much to repay your many acts of kindness
1603092 nobody would think of accepting anything from you mr strehlow
1603093 its one of the laws of the bush that everybody has to help the man whos down and out all of us would be offended if youd offer us any money for doing what is only right and proper thats the sort o thing people down south might do but nobody up hered ever dream of accepting payment for helping somebody that needed it
1603094 and that is why i am asking you to help me now the bush people wont accept any money from me but theyll never refuse a bottle of brandy or whisky would you please ask your husband when he returns to send a couple of bottles of brandy or whisky up to bob buck and allan breaden and to let the men in your hotel have a few rounds of drinks in your bar on my account and i also want your husband to put aside a couple of bottles for himself at my expense after all thats the custom of this country i saw it for myself when i buried old mr sargeant here ten years ago and please send this chair back to henbury i promised bob buck he could have it when i no longer needed it i want the bush people to know how much i have appreciated all they have done for us please give all of them my thanks and may god bless you and your husband and all the bush people for what you and they have done for me and i pray he will reward you richly by giving you all the happiness that you want in your life
1603095 i promise you that ill do everything youve asked me to do
1603096 gusll help me he always has in the past and one thing more gus and i like the rest of us bush folk are only too proud to have this chance of showing you and your wife how much we all admire and respect both of you
1603097 all major factories in hiroshima were on the periphery of the city and escaped serious damage
1603098 the thought of wiping out another 100 000 people was too horrible
1603099 it is necessary to get mr strehlow down to the doctor as quickly as possible
1603100 hold on to classical literature or barbarism will come and to the bible or paganism will come
1603101 and dont ever let me catch you hunting people again at hermannsburg
1603102 i asked the hotelkeeper if he did not think it was time that he should reform seeing that he is 67 years of age but he said he did not think he ever would reform blasphemy mocking and scoffing is the daily diet until the fumes of the whisky have fuzzled the brain and the tongue becomes heavy
1603103 render unto caesar the things that are caesars and unto god the things that are gods
1603104 frieda we have gods own promises of help to depend on and as long as we have complete faith in him he will nay he must answer our prayers for he has promised this himself and if god should fail to honour his own promises we should have the right to throw the bible down at his feet
1603105 no frieda i mean every word of that if god will not carry out his own freely given promises then there is no point in believing in the bible
1603106 i have held out at my post and now my own clerical colleagues are dumping me undoubtedly they think that i will be of no further use to them and that they are not going to waste any money on giving me a chance to live for them to advise me to put my trust in god while they do nothing themselves to help me is merely sanctimonious claptrap all my life i have believed in the power of religion but now i am beginning to see how a religion without love and human kindness corrupts men that is what christ said about the pharisees and i am beginning to suspect that this is true also of too many of us who are lutheran ministers we attack sin so harshly that we forget that christ came into the world for the sake of sinners and that he told the self righteous pharisees that the publicans and the harlots would have a better chance of entering heaven than they themselves despite all their outward show of hypocritical piety
1603107 where are you waiting virgins wise the bridegroom draweth nigh lift up your lamps on high hallelujah go forth to greet prepare to meet the bridegroom at the wedding feast
1603108 dont forget that i am also one of your mothers
1603109 remember me and write to me sometimes and dont be like all those other white boys and girls who were born at hermannsburg and who were reared by us and who then went south and never again wrote to us or sent us anything
1603110 you are one of us you belong to our people you belong to the totem of the twins of ntarea and you are a true aranda go south and learn in the white mens schools but then come back to us no other white child born here has ever returned to us but you must come back to us to your own people
1603111 please let me have a last look at my carl before you put him in his coffin
1603112 you see its been a hot night and your husbands condition has made things worse just try to remember his face as you saw it last night
1603113 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
1603114 they that sow in tears shall reap in joy he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him
1603115 we bush folk are after all christian men and women and not just heathens like them niggers
1603116 noticing a few black looks coming upon the faces of the tired men he added in a more conciliatory tone
1603117 no the first rounds going to be on the house
1603118 thats the first time any of you blokes have ever drunk to the memory of a bible puncher ill bet
1603119 never happened here before and ive lived in this country longer than most
1603120 and ive seen enough floods going down the finke to start calling myself one o the old hands in the country
1603121 as a rule i must say i hate all pious snivelling bastards
1603122 and absolutely dinkum too every time i went up to the mission on the mail run things were the same never any different everybody worked hard it was one of the best run settlements anywhere in this country and you could always get a bunk and a good feed there there was always somebody about whod offer it to you
1603123 must be just about my turn for a shout now
1603124 weve got to keep our whistles wet in this damn rotten hot weather
1603125 when you blokesre ready for it therell be a second round on the house
1603126 perhaps its a good idea having a bloody funeral every so bloody often the horseshoe bend bar isnt as liberal as this as a rule
1603127 you shouldve seen it when old ted sargeant was buried
1603128 you must be one of the few blokes around these parts what hasnt heard the story
1603129 its so bloody old by now that its got white whiskers on it but im no good at spinning yarns ask old bony behind the counter he was here that time just like the rest of us
1603130 ten years ago now back in march nineteen twelve i just seen the date on the gravestone this morning old sargeant suddenly went down with the dts
1603131 he lapsed into a coma as an official police report would say
1603132 and nobody had any idea what to do about him
1603133 next morning after breakfast the mob goes up worried like to take a proper squint at him
1603134 but whatd be the good of a bath o brandy
1603135 what the hell could that do for a bloke with the dts never heard of anything so bloody mad before
1603136 in my young days mothers used to stick their babies into a bath o brandy to stop em having convulsions
1603137 sounds like a shocking damn waste of bloody good grog to me
1603138 never mind dont lets have an argument about it another round of grog harry and lets change over to brandy
1603139 a bath o brandys nothing to laugh about its an old and tried bush remedy only you young blokes dont know nothing about it
1603140 i bet they all stood slobbering at the corners of the mouth like a mob of thirsty dingoes while they were watching the brandy running down over the old boy
1603141 the most wonderful bloody sight i ever set eyes on in my life
1603142 we all felt sorry for the poor old bugger just sitting there not knowing hes sitting in a bath o brandy with good grog running all over him
1603143 then all of a sudden he just collapses in the tub and we knew that was the end of poor old ted
1603144 couldnt he have come round long enough to lap up all that good grog first
1603145 all we could do was pull the poor old bugger out and stretch him out on a bed and some of the men was crying seemed too terrible for bloody words others kept saying what a glorious death dying in a bath o brandy only the poor old bugger didnt know a flamin thing about it after that old gus got to work on the phone we knew mr strehlow was somewhere on the road close to the old crown gus rang at eight in the morning but hed already left when gus heard the mission horses were all pretty well knocked up he sent down a team of fresh horses to meet the mission buggy told the boy to ride like hell and bring mr strehlow up that afternoon for the funeral when he came the whole bang lot of us went down to the grave as is fit and proper after that we all came back to the bar to drink to poor old teds memory needed it too wed had to listen to a good old hellfire sermon at the grave
1603146 well as i was saying we all came back to the bar after the funeral
1603147 next day some bloody bugger spoiled it all went up to old gus and wanted to know where all that grog had come from reckoned gus mustve bottled up the brandy from the bathtub and served it out to the mob
1603148 anyway it served you right for being nothing but a mob of common greedy drunks
1603149 well nobody could prove anything for sure against old gus of course
1603150 he certainly poured all that grog out of bottles that afternoon only they all came out of a box standing on the floor behind the bar so nobody could tell if the bloody corksd been pulled before or not well gus naturally denied everything and nobody minded much about it next day too late anyway and the grog had tasted all right no doubt about that
1603151 they tell me that after nelson died at the battle of trafalgar his body was taken to england in a cask of rum to preserve it for his funeral
1603152 and when the body was pulled out the cask was only half full of rum some of the sailors keeping guard mustve got thirsty in the night at least old sargeant had been pulled out of the tub as soon as ever he was dead that brandy hadnt been swishing round his corpse for days
1603153 and the grog were drinking today has come out of bottles never opened before
1603154 since old bony over there started telling his snake yarn ive been watching all that grog carefully thats on the shelves behind the counter and all the tops of the bottles are good and sound
1603155 and then well close the bar or you blokes might start getting too noisy remember theres a woman just across the passage and shes been crying her heart out in her room ever since the old man died lets give her a fair go and get out of the bar and back on the verandah
1603156 the elephant in the room here is that knowledge of the human genome and the understanding of genes that cause disability will lead to prenatal diagnosis and abortion of persons with various disabilities as has happened to people with downs syndrome i personally do not want to live in a world without persons with intellectual disabilities how would you respond to this concern
1603157 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
1603158 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
1603159 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
1603160 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
1603161 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
1603162 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
1603163 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
1603164 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
1603165 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
1603166 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
1603167 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
1603168 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
1603169 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
1603170 they are welcome and that we would serve them if they came
1603171 if you want to minister to widows start talking to them from the pulpit and they will come
1603172 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit
1603173 sit here and wait in galilee and people will come
1603174 make the teaching about god our savior attractive in every way
1603175 in everlasting memory of the anguish of our ancestors may those who died rest in peace may those who return find their roots may humanity never again perpetrate such injustice against humanity we the living vow to uphold this
1603176 there is no such thing as normal when it comes to the human mental landscape
1603177 that guy is very tall but that is really kind of irrelevant
1603178 sure you are critical of this situation but what would you do jeff
1603179 in the spirit of matthew 18 lets see if we can tolerate can live with this distraction and in a spirit of love continue on with our service
1603180 speak up every so often so i know that you are listening
1603181 your father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost
1603182 the design of products and environments to be usable by all people to the greatest extent possible without the need for adaptation or specialized design
1603183 we are going to have people start coming here who are autistic autistic people sometimes make strange noises that largely will make us feel uncomfortable because we have not been around them enough to have their noises no longer bother us but we will get better over time as we become acclimated to them and them to us what we cannot do is reject them because that is sin and we dont want to sin
1603184 you should be celebrating that all the spots are filled
1603185 if i just keep the people in the house and not give them access to the outside world i would be much better off
1603186 quit doing the community integration stuff you need to be regulated by us if you are going to have your residents develop friendships how dare you do something apart from our regulation
1603187 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
1603188 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved
1603189 it is always well agreed upon that the best therapy is to never do the same thing for too long
1603190 the parents do not want this objective so it is dead
1603191 i think the entire church can learn true authenticity from this picture and i am going to find a disabled person that i can help too
1603192 this is the best thing i have ever seen and i am going to be a part of it by helping a disabled person
1603193 this this is worship and i want to be a part of facilitating worship for someone else
1603194 how am i supposed to worship when so and so makes me have to hold him up so he can sing and dance along with everyone else
1603195 how am i supposed to worship in song when so and so sings and mostly is just making a loud off tune noise
1603196 how am i supposed to worship during the sermon when so and so will not sit quietly and listen
1603197 how am i supposed to worship when so and so bothers me continuously with their inappropriate social skills
1603198 everything is positive and its just about making sure we achieve what we want i think my outlook as captain rather than as a player will be totally different peter likes to challenge us on a daily basis there are a lot of strong characters in the england dressing room and opinionated people im convinced we can have a good relationship i wouldnt be here as captain if i wasnt 100 per cent confident of that
1603199 we wanted a captain who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role
1603200 these players are aware what they need to do and they are right on track in terms of preparations the important thing is the awareness of the situation they know they have an opportunity to win the series
1603201 every guy is aware if he is not fully focussed for the next test it could affect the teams performance
1603202 there is a calm focus about the team and there is a humility about how we are going to go about our business there is no arrogance in the environment
1603203 camomilla perch quasi solo per la sua simpatia mette il buonumore e poi perch ha sempre delle idee bellissime e buonissime in cucina
1603204 all these people interested in cricket buy tv licences and surely they have a right to expect that the public sector broadcasters mount bids for the nations summer sport after all just how many people play f1 the sun quoted clarke as saying
1603205 the bbc must answer to the millions of cricket fans about how it prioritises its investment in sports rights
1603206 the bbc is astonished by the comments by the ecb any bid for live test cricket was subject to value for money and fitting into scheduling and in our view neither of these criteria were met
1603207 from my side i tried my best and gave the award to whoever deserved four or five candidates were in contention for the award but dhoni was the best among the lot the whole country wanted dhoni to get the award
1603208 he has done tremendously well after coming to the national team he is the backbone of indian cricket the decision to give dhoni the award has been taken with full support of all members in the selection committee
1603209 the sports ministry has told me that they have received dhonis application before the deadline of july 27 but due to some internal hazards they were not able to trace the application however they later extended the deadline by a day or two
1603210 the whole country is after cricket but i am little bit against the game because i think the popularity of cricket has declined the standard of olympic sports in the country
1603211 im sure kev will bring in new and innovative stuff everyone has their own way of doing things and kev is a bit eccentric and different his approach to the job will be different to everyone else
1603212 i wouldnt expect anything but that from him its exciting they say geniuses are wired slightly differently kev works off a slightly different sheet to the rest of us he thinks in different ways to everybody else there arent many who would think to turn around and hit a ball left handed out of the park when you are a right handed bat it goes to show how his mind works and im sure he will bring that to the captaincy
1603213 oh mummy i hurt my bum you need to kiss mwah mwah it better
1603214 we would like japan to stop its efforts to turn public opinion in a artificial and unfriendly way against russia by using the so called northern territoriesproblem
1603215 russia does a lot to ensure that its citizens view japan its culture and its business activities in the country in a positive way
1603216 omv revokes its intention published on september 25 2007 to make an offer to shareholders of mol of 32 000 hungarian forints 136 2 euros 211 35 dollars per share
1603217 the european commission has indicated that it would not accept commitments that omv had proposed since other commitments would be unacceptable to omv omv has decided to withdraw the merger notification filed with the european commission on january 31 2008
1603218 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
1603219 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
1603220 ought to welcome people being able to express their minds and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely it is a mistake
1603221 but its also an opportunity to say to the chinese people we respect your traditions we respect your history
1603222 im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation and its ballistic missile programmes
1603223 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1603224 they have got to show a verification regime that we can trust
1603225 you can verifiably do what you say youre going to do or you continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world
1603226 more clearly demonstrates the contrast between free and open societies and repressive closed societies than the korean peninsula
1603227 takes its rightful place on the world stage north korea traps its people in misery and isolation
1603228 competing at an olympic games is something that has motivated me since the age of 10 and 11
1603229 on friday at the opening ceremony i will experience something astonishing i never thought i would be chosen to carry the flag but maybe its happened because a lot of athletes identify with me
1603230 i loved my sport from the moment i played my first game and i still enjoy training
1603231 picture this woman who is very tiny and ask yourself how she engaged in armed conflict with six military men
1603232 its not plausible its not credible and theres nothing to support it
1603233 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1603234 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1603235 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan
1603236 shes very traumatized very fragile she doesnt know where her children are

1603243 i think the reason they are having it on a weekday is to reduce the turnout

1603260 do i think we should have a team representing football in the 2012 olympics yes
1603261 we have to respect their views but this is an olympics that is going to take place in london in four years time and i think youll get from my view that theres an appetite for us to have a team

1603267 four foreigners gathered illegally and we express our strong opposition to that
1603268 paul has done a track about how he feels about heather and what was going on with the paparazzi because no one has heard his side of it at all so this will be the first time anyone hears a song relating to that subject its a very emotional and very powerful song
1603269 what the song shows is that rather than feeling embittered towards heather paul just feels sorry for her
1603270 he feels sorry that she was never able to tell him the full truth about her past life
1603271 paul knows heather is a complex person and deeply misunderstood but that she has hardly helped herself by being less than transparent about her life

1603277 men are so simple and so subject to present necessities that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived one recent example i cannot pass over in silence alexander vi did nothing else but deceive men nor ever thought of doing otherwise and he always found victims for there never was a man who had greater power in asserting or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing yet would observe it less nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to his wishes because he well understood this side of mankind

1603304 clearly brett favres popularity in wisconsin has taken an enormous hit over the last several weeks
1603305 they told him well trade you but not within the division
1603306 his first desire was to play here their first desire was for him not to play here
1603307 i just think brett feels like this reporting to packers camp isnt working
1603308 that basically he was not in the right mindset to play here because of all of the things that went on
1603309 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1603310 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time
1603311 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work and i truly understand that if i was in mikes shoes id see it basically the same way he sees it im sure and i think if he was in my shoes hed see it my way i think we both agree on that they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1603312 its not as simple as no 4 running out there playing football
1603313 hes a great football player i loved coaching him loved seeing him play we talked about all of those things but its a situation that is extremely personal for him the path to get to where we are has done some damage thats where he is

1603327 i missed a key point in my fair tax piece below i imagined that any household that spent less than the poverty line would have an incentive to have a fair tax rate of 100 but i was wrong because it is impossible for the fair tax rate to be 100 you see in the fair tax plan the tax rate is tax inclusive what if a sales tax doubled the price of a good in tax exclusive terms it would be a tax rate of 100 but in fair tax tax inclusive terms it would be a tax rate of 50 if the tax doubles the price from 20 to 40 fair tax logic would say that its a 50 tax because 20 is 50 of 40
1603328 the domestic violence industry is one of the most corrupt and unaccountable enterprises in modern day america every year it sucks over 1 billion from the federal treasury and ships the money to a variety of radical feminist organizations dedicated to revamping the family unit thanks to the generosity of the violence against women act domestic violence programs encourage women to file false allegations strip fit fathers of their natural right to parent and doom kids to live in a single parent household with vawa picking up the legal tab of course many men decide to fight the wrongful accusations to restore their good name and protect their children and end up paying their lawyers a princely sum in the process a few years ago the american bar association decided it was time to cash in on this grand social experiment so it set up the aba commission on domestic violence
1603329 the idea that contemporary society can or should try to find direct guidance in the past has been assailed by some historians
1603330 teddy was a conservationist not a preservationist not surprisingly this meant that he wanted to conserve natural resources not preserve them to conserve is to save in order to use later cash reserves are money set aside for the future fuel reserves are there in case you need them later preserves are not supposed to change like a museum or an archeological site they are to be frozen in time
1603331 in its thirty seven year history the libertarian party has had some great candidates and some who were just good some lp standard bearers like browne and paul were tremendous spokesmen for liberty while others were merely average but never in the lps history has the partys presidential candidate actively spread a non libertarian message that is never until now republican bob barr managed to narrowly win the lp presidential nomination on the sixth ballot with 51 of the convention vote rather than being humbled by the narrowness of his victory barr much like bush with his narrow presidential wins interpreted his nomination as a mandate to redefine libertarianism in the mold of dixiecrat states rights conservatism unilaterally casting aside long held libertarian principles like last weeks garbage yes bob barr is getting a certain amount of media coverage but to what end
1603332 the bipartisan systems engineers don t lay hands on patients that would be a distraction
1603333 if the folks at the nber spent their days listening to the cries of pain in the halls of such as merrill lynch which has taken write downs of 46 billion in the past year and recently sold off some assets at 22 cents on the dollar and lent the buyer most of the money to complete the sale they would long ago have signalled recession but if instead they listen to men on the hard edge of the consumer economy they might think things are booming bob iger ceo of disney last week reported more than satisfactory earnings growth especially in the companys theme parks and said he sees no sign of recession
1603334 catholic bishops in california are getting on their high horse and preaching about why gay couples should be denied marriage they are using their unique tax free pulpits to urge church goers to vote for proposition 8 which will strip gay couples of marriage rights one might wonder if the bishops would have felt as strongly had the law legalized marriage to altar boys the bishops are also fund raising from the pulpit for the anti marriage groups trying to pass the law one has to wonder why it is that they are allowed to do this tax free other groups lobbying for legislation do not have that luxury since the catholic church has clearly become a political lobby then it should be treated like one
1603335 ok lets back up here police burst into calvos home with guns blazing because he took delivery of an officially disfavored intoxicant there was no hint of violence no hostages or threats just a lot of wacky weed so why the raid on entebbe tactics the fact is the results could have been a lot worse im not trying to minimize the slaughter of the dogs here im a dog owner myself and id be driven into a murderous rage were anybody to gun the furry beasts down but if animals died people could have died too they often do in these violent drug raids
1603336 at first blush it may not seem that the african american nominee with a decidedly unfamiliar name has much in common with the pin striped wall street lawyer turned prosecutor turned governor and two time gop presidential nominee but look again and its clear that the mccain campaign and its allies want to depict obama as the kind of personality that ultimately doomed dewey the stuck up snob it was deweys misfortune or character flaw to embody one of the most enduringly mocked character types in american politics and culture the pompous figure has been a foil of american comedy just about forever
1603337 it sounds like a very bad made for television movie a mad scientist a violent sociopath a nerd with a dark side who had already tried to kill several people is obsessed with pornography and is fixated on a particular college sorority unleashes a strain of deadly anthrax through the u s mail killing five infecting 17 others and terrorizing the country his motive aside from sheer antisocial vindictiveness he holds the patent for an anthrax vaccine and he also wants to direct the nations attention to the supposedly overlooked and underfunded problem of bio terrorism thatll teach em it reads like some pretty execrable fiction yet the fbi is peddling this farrago of shopworn cliches as the facts surrounding the alleged guilt of bruce e ivins whose suicide the other day ostensibly closes the 7 year old anthrax terrorism case that has baffled investigators and shone a cruel light on the bureaus methods and standards of conduct
1603338 the bush administration suffered a triple play of setbacks last week in its dispute with congress over hirings and firings at the justice department the justice department s inspector general concluded that underlings had illegally and improperly used political criteria to screen career doj employees the house judiciary committee chaired by bush antagonist john conyers voted on party lines to cite karl rove for contempt and a federal judge rejected the administration s argument that white house aides harriet miers and josh bolten should not have to testify before congress regarding the dismissals of eight u s attorneys a few things to keep in mind first the inspector general s report found no evidence that former attorney general alberto gonzales or anyone above him in the bush white house knew about the improper hirings much less orchestrated them bush s critics of course will elide this finding in their rush to accuse him of politicizing justice so far however we have no reason to think this was anything other than a few inexperienced and overzealous appointees who crossed the line
1603339 the updated task force recommendations for men ages 50 to 74 are in line with the current recommendations from the american cancer society and other major medical groups
1603340 our guidelines say men 50 and over with at least a 10 year life expectancy should be offered screening but the choice should be made by patients with their doctors this means men should be given the option to be tested and can make a decision after weighing the pros and cons
1603341 but to show you how non specific a psa test is only one third of the time does the biopsy show cancer
1603342 its not like pancreatic cancer which is a very aggressive cancer
1603343 prostate cancer has different grades severities the vast majority thats detected does not kill you if you pick up a high grade cancer yes i recommend treatment such as surgery radiation or a combination
1603344 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1603345 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate

1603347 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law

1603351 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into

1603364 in hindsight i think going to an all girls school meant we missed out socially we came out of school and it was suddenly oh my god boys i was all about how do i look what is he thinking we werent used to being around boys in a normal setting and seeing them as friends

1603371 philip and leona have a dinner booked in later this month
1603372 they have fitted it in after he returns from ibiza and before she heads back to the states
1603373 he knows she is emerging into one of the worlds top pop stars and wants to discuss her doing her own topshop range
1603374 shes a beautiful girl and a huge star but also has a great girl next door quality that means her style will appeal to lots of young women leona is really excited
1603375 there were about 60 crewmen sitting around eating salami sandwiches its really the least sexy thing you can ever imagine
1603376 these characters are in love with each other oh my gosh people are so conservative
1603377 anytime that my name and best kiss come up im more than inclined to accept the award
1603378 i am very happy right now in my single womanhood im enjoying the company of different kinds of men i am sure i will want a relationship at some point but right now im really taking time for the recovery process

1603424 thats as a proof point and we will basically be first to market
1603425 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1603426 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1603427 you dont want to jeopardize their long term health and were talking about a 22 year old kid here
1603428 i told him he could have me or a model without a brain the obsession with weight today is just incredible curves have gone out of the window and i dont understand it
1603429 the only conclusion that can be drawn from this data is that long term changes in the north atlantic climate system has an effect upon or is affected by changes in the earths rotation rate thus we can say that the nao correlates with the rate of change of the earths rotation however we do not know which one affects the other
1603430 it seems extraordinary that a variation of a few milliseconds in length of day could affect earth climate measurably
1603431 it seems extraordinary that a variation of a few milliseconds in length of day could affect earth climate measurably the correlation seems to be there but could another factor be a possible orbital variation in the moons interaction with the earth amplifying the effect on our climate
1603432 transfers of angular momemntum from the earth to the atmosphere have been shown to affect wind and circulation patterns in the atmosphere and oceans and vice versa it has long been assumed that these transfers of angular momentum to and from the earth were equal and opposite snce it was believed that earth ocean atmosphere system conserved its angular momentum as it was not subject to external torques other than the sun and moon my work suggest that this assumption is wrong
1603433 velocity within the stripes does not always follow the orientation of the stripes
1603434 i agree that its useful to see the raw data but the statistical confirmation of the visual impression is i think the definitive factor i realize that there are some tricks involved in this data youre lining up peaks not correlating all the data nevertheless this kind of statistical analysis has been done many times and i think it a major deficiency in your presentation that you dont provide that calculation
1603435 are you suggesting that the angular momentum transfer also includes an energy transfer that is increasing the lod requires a transfer of energy as well as momentum and wed expect from the tidal mechanism that this transfer of energy would take the form of heat are you suggesting that this heat is a source of temperature change
1603436 you misunderstand i wasnt talking about changes in insolation due to changes in the earth sun distance i was talking about changes in solar output due to changes in the internal gravitational field of the sun im sure that some partial differential equation loving stellar structure people have tackled this problem if only because its so horribly hairy given the high sensitivity of reaction rates to pressure id expect that this factor would be more important than tidal effects any thoughts on this
1603437 may i draw you attention to a report in new scientist earlier this year of the recent discovery of stripes of surface currents on all of the oceans running west east and west east in parallel bands from more or less the artic to the antarctic
1603438 the global atmospheric electric circuit and its effects on cloud microphysics
1603439 however given my limited resources and time i believe that my data is sufficiently convincing to put it forward so that it will promote discussion and further investigations
1603440 their existence is so surprising that we had to prove first that they are not an artefact of satellite data
1603441 this is slower than most previously known currents only a very lazy canoeist would notice the effect
1603442 they are a fascinating new aspect to the oceans circulation but the jury is still out on the mechanisms leading to their formation
1603443 the rotational energy does not heat the earth as you rightly point out but it could influence the rate of upwheling of deep cold water in the oceans and so control the worlds thermostat
1603444 the temperature at a depth of 100 metres varied by 12 degrees
1603445 how long lived are the stripes and does their advent and or disappearance or mitigation play a part in upwellings and pdo phase shift

1603450 no offense but can i suggest that you enrol in a high school physics course most high school physics students woud have no trouble recognising the the flaws in your arguements
1603451 gordon i think that ian is not talking about the earths orbital variations but rather its rotational variations
1603452 three types of torque operate between the solid earth and its fluid envelope the atmosphere and oceans pressure gravitational and frictional torques
1603453 we know that the strongest planetary tidal forces acting on the lunar orbit come from the planets venus mars and jupiter in addition we known that over the last 4 6 billion years the moon has slowly receded from the earth during the course of this lunar recession there have been times when the orbital periods of venus mars and jupiter have been in resonance s with the precession rate for the line of nodes the lunar orbit when these resonances have occurred they would have greatly amplified the effects of the planetary tidal forces upon the lunar orbit hence the observed synchronization between the precession rate of the line of nodes of the lunar orbit and the orbital periods of venus earth mars and jupiter could simply be a cumulative fossil record left behind by these historical resonances
1603454 at first glance there does not appear to be an obvious physical phenomenon that would link the suns motion about the solar systems cm to the earths rotation rate however such a link could occur if the rate of precession of the line of nodes of the moons orbit were synchronized with orbital periods of terrestrial planets and jupiter which in turn would have to be synchronized with the orbital periods of the three remaining jovian planets in this case the orbital periods of the jovian planets which cause the asymmetries in the suns motion about the cm would be synchronized with a phenomenon that is known to cause variations in the earths rotation rate namely the long term lunar tides
1603455 in the space of one hundred and seventy six years the lower mississippi has shortened itself two hundred and forty two miles that is an average of a trifle over a mile and a third per year therefore any calm person who is not blind or idiotic can see that in the old o litic silurian period just a million years ago next november the lower mississippi was upwards of one million three hundred thousand miles long and stuck out over the gulf of mexico like a fishing pole and by the same token any person can see that seven hundred and forty two years from now the lower mississippi will be only a mile and three quarters long and cairo illinois and new orleans will have joined their streets together and be plodding comfortably along under a single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen there is something fascinating about science one gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact

1603465 barack wants to focus on new technology to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling
1603466 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
1603467 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which would then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved

1603475 so in an anarchic society citizens are just inhabitants in a voluntary society then individuals would be free to try to establish various systems for accomplishing certain tasks and most importantly others would be free to remain outside the systems if they so chose without penalty as a necessary consequence of that choice for example a healer might choose to let a guild examine her methods and materials in order to certify that she meets their standards but if she does not choose to do that she remains free to ply her trade without interference from anyone in other words in an anarchic society individuals are free to organize if they wish but are not coerced into any sort of organization or hierarchy

1603477 calls on the egyptian government to respect human rights and religious freedoms
1603478 it is true that christians suffer many problems in egypt but this does not warrant a plea for foreign interference as the necessary channels exist here in egypt
1603479 it is true that legally christian religious channels do not have permission to broadcast on state egyptian networks namely nilesat but problems can be aired through appearing on opposition channels
1603480 in the past there might have been a reason to seek help abroad but now the government allows opposition and demonstrations if christian egyptians want to air their views they should do so by coming to egypt and discussing the issues here
1603481 we will deal with our problems internally america should and will have to seek the advice of the coptic church in egypt before any resolution is passed in congress
1603482 that the churchs opinion plays such as large role in representing coptic citizens points to the fact that this state has become a religious state rather than a civil state
1603483 the situation in egypt which has escalated in recent years calls for outside pressure the channels are locked to egyptian christians none of the recommendations made at the national coptic conference last year have been dealt with and the peoples assembly has not passed anything to help their situation we are without laws to protect copts
1603484 said pressure is not likely to be anything more than a verbal warning we know that egypt is a pivotal strategic ally to america and unfortunately this takes priority
1603485 but it will still make the egyptian government aware that this problem cant be hidden
1603486 america looks to its interest first and foremost an example of this is its stance on the inheritance of the presidency which america was traditionally against
1603487 when the us saw in the peoples assembly elections that the muslim brotherhood might be a real alternative it altered its position there is a local saying in egypt and it rings true here whoever covers himself with america is naked

1603512 remember in our innermost being we are all completely lovable because spirit is love beyond what anyone can make you think or feel about yourself your unconditioned spirit stands shining with a love nothing can tarnish
1603513 when mystics use the word love they use it very carefully in the deeply spiritual sense where to love is to know to love is to act if you really love from the depths of your consciousness that love gives you a native wisdom you perceive the needs of others intuitively and clearly with detachment from any personal desires and you know how to act creatively to meet those needs dexterously surmounting any obstacle that comes in the way such is the immense driving power of love
1603514 therefore when i say that i love it is not i who love but in reality love who acts through me love is not so much something i do as something that i am love is not a doing but a state of being a relatedness a connectedness to another mortal an identification with her or him that simply flows within me and through me independent of my intentions or my efforts
1603515 when you are aware that you are the force that is life anything is possible miracles happen all the time because those miracles are performed by the heart the heart is in direct communion with the human soul and when the heart speaks even with the resistance of the head something inside you changes your heart opens another heart and true love is possible
1603516 when we know that the cause of something is in ourselves and that we ourselves are one of the few things in the universe that we have the right and ability to change
1603517 all personal breakthroughs begin with a change in beliefs so how do we change the most effective way is to get your brain to associate massive pain to the old belief you must feel deep in your gut that not only has this belief cost you pain in the past but its costing you in the present and ultimately can only bring you pain in the future then you must associate tremendous pleasure to the idea of adopting a new empowering belief
1603518 the most effective way is to get your brain to associate massive pain to the old belief
1603519 if you expect the best you will be the best learn to use one of the most powerful laws in this world change your mental habits to belief instead of disbelief learn to expect not to doubt in so doing you bring everything into the realm of possibility

1603616 let me have men about me that are fat sleek headed men and such as sleep onights yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous
1603617 there are no respectable reasons for wanting not to be fat
1603618 i was getting ahead then zoning my sights down and they were beating the ground up
1603619 was about as good as weve seen it this year
1603620 we know so much more about our guys than we did a year ago
1603621 theres not as much competition as there was a year ago for the last spots and depth chart movement were in a different place than last year
1603622 ricky being banged up and not out here is a big reason for that
1603623 i think a lot of guys are getting their shot
1603624 mr marshall has not been convicted nor charged with a crime

1603635 i am excited to be a part of an organization that is so important to shelby county and the charities it supports

1603639 i am glad i brought this course this monster to its knees
1603640 excuse my poor social skills i was a gamer as a child
1603641 our research shows the rough has become less of a challenge for the highly skilled pro and driving accuracy is now less of a key factor for success
1603642 we believe these changes will increase the challenge of the game at the tour level while having a very small effect on the play of most golfers
1603643 they cant keep making courses longer and they cant keep us from hitting the ball far so if you can limit the amount of spin on the ball and make guys play from the fairway thats probably a good avenue
1603644 because i feel like it will be more challenging for a player to judge shots out of the rough is the ball going to spin how is it going to come out i like that challenge and feel like it gives me a better chance
1603645 if youre not getting as much spin then youre probably going to have to start using a softer golf ball
1603646 we have a friendly medical center to serve the variety of medical needs better
1603647 thats one of our challenges in the future here now we dont have any particular complaints of breathing problems

1603671 emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive emotions to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought to understand emotions and emotional knowledge and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional and intellectual growth
1603672 it is very important to understand that emotional intelligence is not the opposite of intelligence it is not the triumph of heart over head it is the unique intersection of both

1603675 the weather started getting rough the tiny ship was tossed if not for the courage of the fearless crew the gondola would be lost the gondola would be lost
1603676 i knew i had a good chance of winning if i just played solid on the front and didnt make any mistakes
1603677 perhaps the best marketing plan i ever had was closing the place
1603678 the turf club is already sold out for closing day aug 17 and we have booked more than 8 000 people in group sales we have never had demand like that during a regular meet or the fair and we did really well the final weekend of our last regular season
1603679 i dont have a hail mary left in my arm
1603680 its very difficult and not just for me but for the employees and my management team well all miss it but to some extent ive been reconciled to this for years it has lasted longer than any of us thought it would
1603681 im in the business of taking a young man and building him into a responsible young man and obviously i feel like ive failed in this situation
1603682 sometimes for the better good of the whole some parts have to be sacrificed
1603683 were still growing were still going to get better as each game goes on but i think tonight we learned something
1603684 we have a familiarity with each other this was absolutely the best preparation we could have going into next week
1603685 i think it is just frustrating to find that such type of cheating planned cheating is still going on
1603686 the dna analyses are 100 percent so if the urine does not belong to the athlete then they certainly have a case to answer its a sad story
1603687 weve seen a dramatic uptick in fan and corporate interest

1603690 she has a great relationship with cal coach joanne boyle and her staff
1603691 it wasnt about location there was a comfort there with the coaches with everything shes gone through
1603692 what if they call me up while theyre there it was very upsetting i thought i might not pitch because of my passport
1603693 i was more worried about my passport than i was thinking about getting called up but i was going to get there somehow even if they had to stick me in a suitcase and drive me there
1603694 were taking existing resources that are already available and then providing more training and organization and expertise for those individuals coming home
1603695 it is a good fit because our military personnel are already pretty physically active also the idea of representing their country is very important to them
1603696 for a long time i went through a lot of depression
1603697 it takes a big toll in your life to go through what i have but i learned there is light at the end of the tunnel
1603698 when i put the uniform on there is a lot of pride all over again and there are a lot of veterans like me who are injured thats going to be our future with the paralympics
1603699 they are the greatest athletes in the world who are physically disabled there are world records and amazing performances
1603700 one of our biggest supporters is the u s paralympics team
1603701 we teamed up with the olympic training center and they are working with us as we train for future events
1603702 a lot of the paralympic athletes show up at our events
1603703 the movement exists today as a result of injured veterans coming home from all over the world
1603704 we have always served the military weve always been involved with veterans that is why we are here
1603705 i cant tell you how important sport is in rehabilitation not just in the physical side but the mental side
1603706 look at scott winkler he left this country larger than life and came home in a wheelchair it was sport that re engaged him it not only changes the individuals perspective but the perspectives of friends and the family and the entire support network
1603707 it gives you something else to do something to focus on because when you are sitting in the hospital you are depressed and thinking oh my life is over now
1603708 life is not over just because youre injured or disabled there is a whole new life you can lead
1603709 i have a saying if you can believe you can achieve
1603710 i dont know anybody who wouldnt want a randy winn
1603711 its hard to find a player like randy whos got the whole game
1603712 his speed hes a switch hitter his defense a lot of clubs would love to have randy on their team
1603713 i dont think im doing anything different leadoff is a comfortable spot for me a spot ive hit in my whole minor league career and early in my major league career but i felt comfortable hitting third
1603714 i dont buy it that said sometimes a change is good in the order it breaks things up you might have them get a different look how they go into a game
1603715 it was a bad pitch to barajas a bad pitch to mench
1603716 its frustrating really frustrating wed lost seven in a row and had three outs to get to a win im frustrated with myself
1603717 even though this is a horrible outing and poor timing with everything thats going on with the team with the losing streak and me personally with the situation as the teams closer weve got to put this behind us its going to be difficult to sleep no doubt about it but when i wake up tomorrow its over
1603718 i was on my last legs in 2008 i was 42 years old and they still couldnt beat me
1603719 thats nothing mad dog i was out of the majors for three years three years but i came back and dominated those guys like nothing happened

1603724 weve got some guys who can drive the ball these things run in streaks sometimes im hoping well start driving the ball not just home runs but squaring up on balls and driving the gaps we did have quite a skid there
1603725 i asked him tell me im wrong that youre playing again for all the right reasons
1603726 i thought he was extremely emotional last spring i thought his decision to un retire was emotional he told me that wasnt the case so i have to respect that
1603727 i never thought through this whole process that he was going to play this year if im wrong then im wrong
1603728 i just know we were at practice today and favre wasnt there and im the starter
1603729 i think weve been pretty united throughout this whole thing its definitely been difficult for all parties involved but weve tried to stay focused as a team
1603730 its gone on long enough the franchise needs to say one way or another we want brett or we dont want brett if they dont do it then brett needs to say he wants to be here or not be here
1603731 for them to keep us in the dark and have us answering a bunch of questions we cant possibly have a good answer for that isnt fair to us something needs to be said yea or nay for brett favre
1603732 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction
1603733 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons

1603749 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england i didnt wait 18 months to get beaten
1603750 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1603751 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1603752 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted okay but now i need to start performing properly
1603753 before this ankle operation i thought if i didnt think i could recapture the form of previously i wouldnt have put myself up for all of this

1603773 the commission believes that by including questions from internet participants we will enhance and expand the effectiveness of the town meeting debate this technique has been employed in different ways during many of the primary debates we will continue to learn from its use in the primary season and we intend to consult with experts in information technology who can help us integrate it into a general election town meeting in a manner consistent with our non partisan charter
1603774 happiness is an attitude of mind born of the simple determination to be happy under all outward circumstances
1603775 if a person gets his attitude toward money straight it will help straighten out almost every other area in his life
1603776 a positive attitude may not solve all your problems but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort
1603777 by starving emotions we become humorless rigid and stereotyped by repressing them we become literal reformatory and holier than thou encouraged they perfume life discouraged they poison it
1603778 emotions are the next frontier to be understood and conquered to manage our emotions is not to drug them or suppress them but to understand them so that we can intelligently direct our emotional energies and intentions
1603779 an individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity
1603780 you are my lord apart from you i have no good thing

1603798 there has been a significant increase in the amount of real world trading this year if we dont find a solution to rwt now it will ruin runescape
1603799 thats the case with all cheating whether its buying gold or cheating your way through a console game its fun for a while but the challenge goes and things quickly get boring
1603800 real world traders believe they are running legitimate businesses in some cases though its essentially organised crime
1603801 the first bots in runescape were identified by us within a few months of the games release
1603802 we dealt with them the best way we could at that time by changing the game so they were no longer able to function
1603803 we keep developing technologies to combat bots but its like an arms race c we stop bots they improve their macros we stop them they improve again
1603804 if we dont break that vicious cycle now it would just keep getting worse and worse it could reach a point where macro software becomes undetectable
1603805 all customer support teams combined were banning tens of thousands of accounts each month that belong to real world traders most of these are bots but we also secure many accounts that real world traders have stolen and return them to their rightful owners
1603806 the player and forum moderators and other legitimate players have put in a lot of effort and deserve recognition
1603807 for a long time players have thought were not doing anything as they dont see everything we do weve been working on this problem every single day
1603808 we still regularly go bot busting though so players can see we are doing something
1603809 we have automatic and manual systems in place to identify bots but limited resources to deal with them it isnt possible to find and ban every single one
1603810 the player and forum moderators and other legitimate players have put in a lot of effort and deserve recognition they see more than we ever could so we follow up on as many abuse reports as possible
1603811 every time we double our efforts gold sellers quadruple theirs we cant continue only using our current methods throwing more and more resources at it
1603812 weve seen other mmogs take that route and it works but only to a limited extent some players would sell gold through their own website to avoid paying the developer a cut worse than that the demand for gold was still mostly being met by players using bots and scams ruining the experience for legitimate players
1603813 it would be very difficult to find a way of allowing players to buy runescape items for real money that doesnt cheapen the game
1603814 we looked at any number of different possible solutions weve read independent studies and spoken with other people in the mmog industry ultimately the consensus is that the only way to remove the real world trading market is to develop your game so you cannot make unbalanced trades
1603815 the key phrase is not profitable were changing our game in a way that doesnt negatively affect its gameplay but which makes real world trading not worth the effort
1603816 deciding to remove unbalanced trade was not an overnight decision c we started working on it in 2006
1603817 i could have removed unbalanced trade at any time its just a few lines of code
1603818 the easy thing would have been to say right lets leave the wilderness as it is you just cant pick up other players drops instead of just removing things weve looked to replace them with something equivalent or indeed better
1603819 i think bounty hunter and clan wars are actually going to be enjoyed by more players
1603820 weve felt for a long time that some of this content needed changing anyway c especially the wilderness c so this was a good opportunity for us to make it work better more fun for our players and closer to our original intentions
1603821 we know its going to be a bumpy ride but in the long term runescape is going to be better for it
1603822 we know its going to be a bumpy ride but runescape is going to be better for it
1603823 est is muy pendientes de estados unidos y de momento tenemos que centrarnos en grecia estamos en un grupo muy dif cil
1603824 what the heck why havent i seen this gal around
1603825 uh moe willie never intended for france to be invaded his comment falls in the category of sarcasm and irony two things that are understood by people with normal intelligence
1603826 when we invade france and drag osama out of his hotel of course
1603827 btw when do we get to kill osama bin laden
1603828 i need to borrow 65 000 for a 42 000 car the problem is there are plenty of folks dumb enough to make that kind of purchase my concern is the same lenders that would still loan some of these folks the extra 20k in a heartbeat
1603829 methinks moe is in his cross dressing mode currently wearing a freudian slip
1603830 if you went camping and woke up with your pants pulled down around your knees and ky jelly smeared all over your butt would you tell anybody
1603831 of course a white guy wearing a mccain mask looking to sodomize a black guy would be completely off limits just another day at gitmo
1603832 tell ya what sport lets reverse this and you provide the proof that algore lives in a modest house uses fuel efficient vehicles and rides delta or another carrier see i think you people should do your own research or get the government to do it for you
1603833 i know this is a waste of time with you two but proof
1603834 this guy does more damage to the planet on one trans continental private plane ride than my entire family can do in a year
1603835 not to mention the cost of hvac for his mansion but he will eventually fill the house with mercury vapor lights i guess we just need to understand that we serfs should live in little shacks and poop in a bucket for our compost pile while our betters do as they please
1603836 this guy does more damage to the planet on one trans continental private plane ride than my entire family can do in a year
1603837 too bad the media was busy asking him about lapel pins and hawaiian birth certificates
1603838 the king of the two americas jon edwards seems to have two families as well but one of them is classified
1603839 are the american voters that stupid to believe that all of the germans would be there to see obama read from a teleprompter
1603840 but in the darkest hours the people of berlin kept the flame of hope burning the people of berlin refused to give up i guess were not supposed to think about how obama wanted and still wants to give up on the iraq war surely if hed been there in 1948 he would have said the berlin airlift is hopeless he thought the surge was hopeless i wont excerpt the rest of the speech you can read it but ill summarize come on people now smile on your brother everybody get together try to love one another right now
1603841 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
1603842 heres a tip for the media and obama moonbats who will undoubtedly convince themselves this was the kind of stuff moses is said to have climbed a mountain to hear
1603843 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
1603844 i will not have this debate trivialized by their excuse for their failed policy
1603845 power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely great men are almost always bad men
1603846 cmon tell me there isnt something a little funny about having someone finally drilling in ole teds alaskan frontier
1603847 maybe this champion of the conservative movement can rescue you guys
1603848 make it go away it burns me precious it burns
1603849 sen mccain is a conservative republican who believes more government is rarely the solution to a set of challenges
1603850 either through laziness or a feeling of shame because you know they probably provided no sources for these comments either
1603851 overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course
1603852 does anybody even remember who this chick hillary is she has disappeared faster than rev wright did most likely having some quality time with the loving husband sipping mai tais they are such a happy couple arent they not anything like those other bitter clingy bible thumper gun toting white folks
1603853 oil is an inelastic good companies can price it however they like
1603854 this even excluding exploration or equipment production set up or the fact that 9 wells in 10 statistically come up dry doesnt fix our oil problem because the market has set the price at 120 barrel and that number isnt coming down so long as gas stations can continue to sell oil at inflated rates
1603855 russians can start producing oil from three months of touching a drill bit to the dirt
1603856 wont do anything to the price of oil in the short term
1603857 it will be 10 to 15 years before we see a drop of oil from those fields
1603858 yes when fwed cant refute the points made in the story he can alway revert back the standard
1603859 the lincoln group a washington based public relations company was told early in 2005 by the pentagon to identify religious leaders who could help produce messages that would persuade sunnis in violence ridden anbar province to participate in national elections and reject the insurgency according to a former employee
1603860 are your proposing we continue paying people to not kill each other into eternity
1603861 why yes it did you and barack obama are the only two people on the planet who wont admit it he for political reasons you because of mental illness
1603862 perhaps he should throw himself under obamas bus before barry has to say anything
1603863 edwards needs to do the right thing here hopefully he is doing it now
1603864 last i checked the campaign was for president of the united states and not world emperor
1603865 someone needs to remind w and cheney about that i believe
1603866 last i checked the campaign was for president of the united states and not world emperor
1603867 obama tells every one of us we need to learn a foreign language
1603868 i dont have an art degree am i allowed to petition my community to build an art museum i dont have a pilots license am i prohibited from asking for better faa funding i dont farm should i be allowed to talk about irrigation in my area
1603869 and what non english languages do you have a native level fluency in thc
1603870 it reminds me of a recent episode of jon stewarts less than entertaining show where he comments about obamas whirlwind traveling sideshow throughout the world after a clip of someone mentioning that obama gave a speech in the temple of hercules
1603871 and what non english languages do you have a native level fluency in thc
1603872 you dont speak german but the germans largely speak english
1603873 well traveled perhaps well spoken well perhaps not so well after all
1603874 yeah thatll win votes weve got this shit in the bag
1603875 dan barack was just trying to pull off another camelot connection
1603876 do you even have a passport have you ever conducted business internationally ever sought a high paying professional gig where being multi lingual will earn you thousands more per year
1603877 where is mccain going today texas paris texas and on to new england tomorrow
1603878 the thing i found interesting was that obama spoke in front of 2000 000 in berlin germany
1603879 guess speaking more than one language doesnt necessarily have much to do with marketability unless one is applying for the job of translator
1603880 in the late 1950s mboya was seeking support for a scholarship program that would send kenyan students to us colleges similar to other exchanges the us backed in developing nations during the cold war with the soviet union
1603881 it was not a matter in which we sought to be involved
1603882 nevertheless mr mboya came to see us and asked for help when none of the other foundations could give it when the federal government had turned it down quite precisely we felt something ought to be done
1603883 if i had been told by the pentagon that i couldnt visit those troops and i was there and wanted to be there i guarantee you there would have been a seismic event
1603884 i know of no pentagon regulation that would have prevented him from going there without the media and the press and all of the associated people nothing that i know of would have kept him from visiting those wounded troops
1603885 no disrespect but id say that any church that sports a lesbian minister is a very large neon glowingly bad sign that it is very far from the bible or any sound christ centred doctrine
1603886 my parents met at first parish cambridge and to say that todays church bears little resemblance to the church that led the abolitionist movement is either foolhardy or a lie your choice
1603887 cheney has visited hospitalized wounded warriors and invited walter reed army medical center patients for fly fishing lessons around his swimming pool
1603888 im guessing those constitutionalists are crappy tippers and consequently get extra sauce in their nachos
1603889 we meet at rather nice if not somewhat ironically mexican restaurant in a town central to where many of us live
1603890 although unitarian universalist congregations and fellowships tend to retain some christian traditions such as sunday worship with a sermon and the singing of hymns they do not necessarily identify themselves as christians nor do they necessarily subscribe to christian beliefs
1603891 anybody know the last time president bush visited landstuhl i think laura may have been there
1603892 even if the sect in question unitarian universalist is a heretical sect steeped in both doctrinal error and far from centre liberal politics
1603893 both are within the bounds of the constitution but that doesnt mean they are both the right thing to do
1603894 oh my that redneck church shooter was a real winner unemployed angry gun toting disheveled conservative welfare recipient the list goes on president obama will need to deal with his kind taking their guns away for starters
1603895 seriously are you so god damn racist that you cant even pick a black movie character to represent a black presidential candidate just wondering
1603896 his father samuel nowlin reeves jr b 1942 is chinese and hawaiian his mother patricia taylor is english making him eurasian
1603897 ok totally ill give you this one but liberals have been hating on christians especially evangelical christians for eight years and several church shootings including one in the story you link have been attributed to people hating christians you cant deny the truth and this is the only church shooting i know about that specifically targeted liberals
1603898 you either have a war which is legal and within the bounds of the constitution or you dont
1603899 nbcs andrea mitchell reports that there was never a plan for obama to take the press to landstuhl despite the claim by mccain folks and others the plan was to go with his military aide retired general scott gration the pentagon said gration was off limits because he had joined the campaign violating rules that it not be a political stop obama had gone to see wounded troops in iraq earlier in the week without even confirming hed been there no press no pictures he has done the same when he goes to walter reed never any press
1603900 and on january 9th were going to start rounding youre white asses up and throwing you in gulags when we dont throw you up against a wall che guevera style
1603901 seriously are you so blaspheming removed racist that you cant even pick a black movie character
1603902 now back to the subject at hand which is the
1603903 when obama was in kuwait and iraq he was traveling without reporters or campaign staff and visited military installations as part of a congressional delegation that included sen
1603904 we saw troops everywhere we went on the congressional delegation we went out of our way to see those troops
1603905 you people are being used to perpetuate one of the biggest socialist led hoaxes this country has ever seen and youre just too stupid or blinded by the flame to see through all of the hype
1603906 the problem is you are conflating one war with the other
1603907 the first step must be getting off the wrong battlefield in iraq and taking the fight to the terrorists in afghanistan and pakistan
1603908 the man looks old and pathetic so much so that faux news saw fit to run 8 year old campaign footage in an effort to make the codger look younger
1603909 so lets make it easier for them and just get the
1603910 and your boy obama looks so smart spartan now that he has come around to bushs way of thinking on iraq and afghanistan
1603911 so it appears worst that the great new plans obama has for hope and change in the war against terror are 1 a continued indefinite combat presence in iraq
1603912 the plan allows for a limited number of u s troops to remain as basic force protection to engage in counter terrorism and to continue the training of iraqi security forces
1603913 sen obama but i think if we have played our cards right we are going to see countries like iraq like afghanistan like kuwait those countries are going to be much more comfortable with our troop presence if they feel that theyve been consulted and that theres not the prospect of a long term occupation or permanent bases in iraq
1603914 mr brokaw you want to add two brigades of american troops to the fighting force in afghanistan sen obama right
1603915 actually wahoo its 67 because our esteemed president vetoes any democatic iraq bill
1603916 keep the pressure up patrots the wmds must be found
1603917 take a civics class fred you cant get bills through congress without 60 votes in the senate
1603918 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and president musharraf wont act we will
1603919 they have all run off to kos and huff for new marching orders
1603920 gotcah sic politics aint it fun because you can play it both ways no matter what
1603921 almost a third of british muslim students believe killing in the name of islam can be justified according to a poll
1603922 the war against saddam hussein and his government ended when the regime was overthrown and what remained of its army was disbanded
1603923 but this bucolic scene in his fathers village of kogelo near the equator in western kenya conceals a troubling reality that until now has never been spoken about barack obama the evening standard can reveal after we went to the village earlier this month has failed to honour the pledges of assistance that he made to a school named in his honour when he visited here amid great fanfare two years ago
1603924 considering the level of minorities in the military the gulf between he and mccain on that might not be wht you would normally expect
1603925 how can we possibly find honor in using the fate of our servicemen to score political advantage in washington there is no pride to be had in such efforts we are at war a hard and challenging war and we do no service for the best of us those who fight and risk all on our behalf by playing politics with their service
1603926 but here you are violating another universal law one set out by einstein some 60 years back
1603927 what we ultimately have is a high pressure system expanding to fill the space it has been allowed
1603928 but the vision of dead family and friends trapseying about a cloudy garden of edan where no one ever grows old or feels sad or feels pain just isnt in the cards for you
1603929 the 2nd law of thermodynamics is merely one side of the two sided coin that is the general relativity
1603930 but there really is no such thing as a totally closed system aside from small scale laboratory conditions which can be completely controlled and even then it is more a matter of a degree of closure excluding uncontrollable factors like gravity or cosmic rays and the like
1603931 essentially this loss of energy and information and the general tendency for complex objects organisms and systems to decay breakdown and eventually die cease to exist is a part of nature and is caused by death as a direct result of sin which brought death into the perfectly created and perfectly ordered universe which god built for us to have communion with him in
1603932 because we are all just a bunch of wild animals with no control or responsibility for what we do
1603933 it is all the more plausible that god made adam in his own image
1603934 but even if we bow to hanuman the monkey god and say that we sprang from his loins sans a particular chromosome or half chromosome and a telomere depending upon your perspective
1603935 and if evolution is supposed to be a progression from worse to better and from a thing of low complexity to greater complexity that flies in the face of the second law of thermodynamics
1603936 it still fails to answer for how all life plant animal protist moneran etc evolved from one cell with all the necessary dna
1603937 it never ceases to amaze me how much time islamomonkey ill call him that since he seems to be content with insulting himself by believing he is descended from monkeys has to waste here at rwv
1603938 however we will need to take advantage of our own resources in our back yard if we want to be less dependent upon arab oil as well as help transition to greener energy development and advanced nuclear technology
1603939 what does the uk do that the usa does not
1603940 the uk drills and sources a significant percentage not all not even most but a significant amount of its oil from its north atlantic backyard
1603941 birds and hippos have no more commonality than a brick and a baseball nor are they sired by sea squirts or jellyfish or phytobacteria
1603942 specifically concerning dna i should clarify that these animals didnt
1603943 its your disbelief in evolution that requires the suspension of logic
1603944 but to believe in macro evolution requires a certain daft suspension of logic
1603945 your argument was that higher priced gas would hurt economic growth and reduce the us to a third world country
1603946 the uk shows how an economy can function quite well even in the face of high petrol prices
1603947 the uk drills and sources a significant percentage not all not even most but a significant amount of its oil from its north atlantic backyard
1603948 the insistence that wind and solar energy are simply impractical as a replacement is also rather misguided this issue is addressed somewhat exhaustively right here
1603949 and here you really let your ignorance hang out evolution has been observed and tested exhaustively
1603950 the legendary methuselah supposed grandson of adam and grandfather of noah was said to have lived to 969 years of age
1603951 no one has ever managed to duplicate this feat and no evidence exists to back such an incredible claim
1603952 the thc abuser sock puppet lame o their new recruit carpo and who could forget president carter are as agitated as ever
1603953 ill tell you that evolution takes much more faith to go by than it does in an almighty all wise creator whose name is jesus
1603954 harry reid the dimbulb from searchlight and botox nancy pelosi should both be ashamed of themselves for neglecting their duty to this nation and monkeying around with laws that affect so few are virtually meaningless and are in violation of the tenth amendment to the constitution they supposedly swore to uphold nice to see theyve got their priorities straight
1603955 by a vote of 302 96 last week the house of representatives passed the captive primate safety act a bold step on the road to outlawing pet monkeys the house bill boasts 26 co sponsors including three from illinois republican mark kirk and democrats jan schakowsky and luis gutierrez the senate is expected to take up the companion bill in the next few weeks
1603956 and the earth is about 5800 years old if exactly traced through adam to the present time following the bibles allocation of patriarchal lifespans and lining them up with written history
1603957 now tell us how evolution is a sham and the earth is 6000 years old
1603958 just like in the uk france and germany where gasoline is 2 gallon more expensive
1603959 narcissistic personalities find it physically impossible to admit they are wrong about something
1603960 sorry to inform you that even a financial genius like t
1603961 these guys would defend barry if he got drunk and killed a bus full of nuns
1603962 i cant compete with john cole on this so ill let balloon juice take it away
1603963 tk the liberal mind seems unable to accommodate the concept of hardworking people working to better their lives
1603964 this wanker logic of the left will leave us in the same shape as the third world
1603965 soooo the fact that he crashed his our plane and got captured qualifies him how to be prsident
1603966 after several months of gaffs including the bitter clingy white folk line and reverend wright you do remember him right
1603967 i dont like mccain and havent since 2000 but i respect his service to the country and i would rather vote for osama than obama
1603968 the mccain campaign implied on wednesday that barack obamas commitment to preventing a future genocide was not sincere attacking the democratic candidate during his appearance at the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem
1603969 the troops have done a good job of reducing sectarian violence
1603970 had those political factors not occurred i think that my assessment would have been correct
1603971 ever notice how liberals talk tough and pretend to be looking for a fight then turn into whiny little biatches the minute you hit back
1603972 vic to ry vkt r n pl vic to ries 1 defeat of an enemy or opponent 2 success in a struggle against difficulties or an obstacle 3 the state of having triumphed
1603973 the state of having mr maliki agree with you sort of
1603974 reassuring to see that you can still pop a chubby for a guy that makes bob dole look lively and exciting
1603975 ever notice how liberals talk tough and pretend to be looking for a fight then turn into whiny little biatches the minute you hit back
1603976 not only is mccain speaking the simple truth on obama hes echoing the thoughts of many good americans
1603977 reichtard stupidity will only display itself more insanely and more rabidly the closer we get to november

1603995 lincoln didnt mobilize the us army to free the slaves he fought the civil war to preserve the nation likewise of the hundreds of thousands who died dressed in confederate gray perhaps one in ten owned slaves they died fighting to preserve an institution that they ultimately never even got to indulge in
1603996 theres no need to discuss the other reasons for secession since they were not solved and in fact centralized government became more powerful as a result
1603997 lincoln didnt mobilize the us army to free the slaves he fought the civil war to preserve the nation
1603998 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
1603999 if the blood of over a half million patriotic americans and the lives of 360 000 who never owned slaves those who lincoln pronounced

1604006 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
1604007 it is flattering to get a lot of attention although i must say it is baffling mr
1604008 this crowd is not about me its about you he said
1604009 i am an imperfect vessel for all your hopes and dreams at times i am tired i falter i make mistakes the election is not about me its about you
1604010 everywhere we go weve been seeing these terrific crowds twenty thousand people show up in atlanta twenty thousand people in austin texas we had 15 000 in oakland people have asked me what accounts for all this i would love to take all the credit myself and say its because im just so terrific but i have to say its not about me the reason people are coming out is they are burning with a want and a desire for change
1604011 obama who capped the first day of his weekend ohio bus tour in cleveland saturday night said he is humbled by the historical weight the citys black community has ascribed to his candidacy
1604012 so dont ever forget that this election is not about me or any candidate dont ever forget that this campaign is about you about your hopes about your dreams about your struggles about securing your portion of the american dream
1604013 oh yea top that you want to see me cut off a leg too
1604014 you know i dont pay attention to john mccains ads although i do notice he doesnt seem to have anything to say very positive about himself he seems to only be talking about me you need to ask john mccain what hes for and not just what hes against

1604016 barry hussien obama i have a speech that i am reading off this teleprompter that says that one day black boys and white girls will be able to join hands have babies and have those babies be abandoned by their black fathers as my father did to me i have a speech today
1604017 i say to you today my friends so even though i am totally unqualified to lead this country today or tomorrow i still have a speech it is a speech filled with stolen lines and written by a staff member i have a speech right here on this teleprompter
1604018 i have a speech that that says that one day this nation will vote for an unqualified man of color and piss on the true meaning of its creed
1604019 i have a speech that my two little children will continue to live in a nation where they will be given preferential treatment and be given 20 extra points on all tests for just writing their names due to the color of their skin and not because of their intelligence
1604020 but a great many blacks simply refuse to pull themselves up out of the mire there really is no widespread prejudice or any jim crow laws
1604021 logically then isnt it ultimately the fault of an under civilized tribal system which could not protect its own that is a key reason for why traders in men and women turned to another continent for more

1604023 as a native american myself ill go ahead and say im on board with this if we can also ship back to europe the perpetually aggrieved white conservatives preferably in ships of similar design to the one their ancestors came over on

1604026 hey totally metrosexual nonconservative i know its hard to relate to the other comments with all those voices going on in your head at the same time but give this a try
1604027 i will not take on the guilt of slavery that i had not a damn thing to do with and those who use it as some kind of excuse for their own pathetic life are just that pathetic
1604028 i raised a young black man from the age of 10 thru college
1604029 what if all of us here issued a formal apology in your newspaper for your continued sexual abuse of your dog we could issue the apology for you condemning all acts of violence youve committed and represented that you feel that its no longer an acceptable practice
1604030 i find this apology to be offensive and one of the stupidest things ive seen these people do
1604031 im really sorry that african tribal leaders captured rival tribal members and sold them to the slave traders
1604032 this apology is so offensive it makes me want to throttle someone
1604033 it cant be because of his previous exemplary legislative leadership in either the senate or the illinois statehouse which lead to all sorts of revolutionary changes that raised the hopes of so many or his stentorian ovations which set thousands of ships to sea and so many hearts afire when he was without a teleprompter
1604034 logically then isnt it ultimately the fault of an under civilized tribal system which could not protect its own that is a key reason for why traders in men and women turned to another continent for more

1604083 its slight 150 pages with only about 200 words per page but then the original myth only takes up four pages in my penguin translation of ovids metamorphoses i found it quite engaging though the character who actually has a transforming arc is not the alleged central figure anthea but her sister imogen and this extra strand is probably the salvation of the novel the style of writing long long streams of words lacking punctuation is a touch contrived but mostly suits the characters
1604084 ali smiths girl meets boy is the best of the canongate myth series i read in 2007 exuberant and engaging though nothing this series has done with myth is as innovative as hal duncan
1604085 this story though fanciful encapsulates many of the points i have been trying to make about gender and biological sex not being the same and gender not being fixed first clothes maketh the man vestis virum reddit incorrectly attributed to quintilian iphis is clad and deports herself as a boy and so in the eyes of even some of her closest family she is a boy but secondly iphis life as a boy is seen as in conflict with her biological sex the proper course is for her to seek for what is allowed to women finally the possibility exists for biological sex to be reconciled with gender rather than the other way round admittedly in this particularly radical case divine intervention is required but many of ovids readers would have accepted divine intervention as part of life and examples such as the emperor elagabalus or the galli eunuch priests of cybele suggest that some movement in that direction might be possible for those who wished it

1604263 hi im jane doe and i am the senior vice president of marketing and communications for nefarious software inc
1604264 in the remaining 10 minutes let me tell you how our firm defines todays topic and why you need to hire us to solve it
1604265 well for most of my early career i worked really close to my home shared a commute with my brother and drove a fuel efficient car for one client i stayed at the family ranch to minimize my commute in fact i never flew to a client for the first seven years of my career except for one interesting week in jackson mississippi then the management of our firm decided that my talents would be better utilized at intergalactic world headquarters once i got sent to chicago i got hooked on flying
1604266 the travel was beginning to supplant my everyday life american airlines special services agents were seeing more of me than my own family i realized that i had leisure clothes in my closet that i was never wearing because i was always flying to or from clients but spending no time at home i didnt realize how difficult it would be to not go to midway or ohare airport at least once a week i had withdrawal issues i even missed the smell of that sickly smelling de icing fluid that seeps through the ground by terminal 1 at ohare i missed the smell of burnt kerosene on the tarmac but most importantly i miss those hot steaming towels they hand out in first class yes i know i had an addiction to flying i flew because i thought it was the right thing to do to advance my career and to serve clients and while i thought i was doing the right thing for me professionally and my family economically i now see that i and many others like me wasted a whole lot of fossil fuel
1604267 well for starters i have embraced webex dhl freeconferencecall com email and skype as my new higher powers
1604268 ive decided to work full time from my home office commuting simply wastes motor fuel and eats up a lot of valuable time an office i have come to realize seems to be more about prestige and ego not around saving scarce natural resources as to flying i almost never take trips of a purely promotional nature anymore i dovetail business development activities on the backs of other client related flights to minimize wasteful trips and the high sg amp a costs they generate

1604295 while this is clearly a military ship and has a military purpose it also has a humanitarian purpose and a diplomatic purpose
1604296 it shows how far cambodia has come and that it is taking its rightful place among our community of nations
1604297 absolutely this shows an expansion a deepening of relations not just military but humanitarian and diplomatic
1604298 we are going to engage not only on the military level but on the community level
1604299 we are ready for expansion and several different agencies have expressed an interest in coming here and opening up offices

1604313 roughly once every three minutes typical cubicle dwellers set aside whatever theyre doing and start something else anything else it could be answering the phone checking e mail responding to an instant message clicking over to youtube or posting something amusing on facebook these distractions consume as much as 28 of the average u s workers day including recovery time and sap productivity to the tune of 650 billion a year according to basex a business research company in new york city
1604314 the hubris can either be a personal hubris in the case of the cults top hierarchy or more usually for rank and file members it is a kind of projected hubris or hubris by proxy the hope and expectation that in due course after diligent practice they will attain the ideal for themselves
1604315 to varying degrees believers can experience a sort of religious mania of inspiration when they are in the hubris phase identifying with this idealised imaginary new self with its perfect perception and understanding etc
1604316 believers can become addicted to this inspiration and can become dependent on the group and its leadership whom they regard as teachers and guides to validate their spiritual progress and to maintain this inspiration of course cult leaders can exploit this dependency for their own purposes
1604317 if members fall out of favour even temporarily with the group leadership or if they begin to doubt if they can achieve the groups ideals they may experience a sort of religious depression in the form of anxiety or guilt over their seeming inability to free themselves from their negative old self with all its bad habits and weaknesses and lack of faith
1604318 at an extreme believers fear they will become ill or fall into hell if they leave the group
1604319 it would be a mistake to assume that only weak willed people join cults on the contrary it is often the more ambitious and strong willed people who become the most committed cult members

1604436 im afraid you are in for a little bit of philosophizing if you dont mind

1604438 how something is remembered will determine how much is remembered

1604440 to just believe him cause youve worked on sunday for the last 6 years
1604441 idea that presidential candidates need to be likeable a dangerous cultural idiocy
1604442 getting elected president is much like winning a high school popularity contest except that in high school the cool kids generally arent given access to thermonuclear weapons
1604443 what makes me more likeable in the eyes of my customers than my arch enemy
1604444 a recession is when your neighbor loses his job a depression is when you lose yours
1604445 is a mandatory strategy in tough times like these because even though you may win the selection process you still havent won the business
1604446 s refiri ndose a la queja de cervantes de que no ten a con quien hablar recuerda que la presencia de otro de un amigo es una condici n para el ejercicio del pensamiento y dice s que efectivamente se da el m s terrible de los vac os y de las soledades cuando no se pueden confrontar los propios pensamientos con quienes est n en torno porque stos son de otra onda de pensamientos y que de eso era de lo que se quejaba cervantes cuando estaba en argel y que esquivias tambi n debi ven rsele encima y esto es poco m s o menos de lo que se hab a quejado ovidio pongamos por caso cuando estaba en el ponto porque es cierto que un pensamiento se logra gracias a otro o a otros o al otro o no habr tal cosa ni escritura ni obra art stica y cierto es que hay p ramos intelectuales y espirituales que arricen y liquidan las inteligencias y las nimas
1604447 hmmmm i guess we should have emphasized offense more in our preparations

1604453 espa oles nacidos y por nacer sabed que de alg n tiempo ac me acosa la idea de conservar empapelados con los f ciles ingredientes de tinta y pluma los p blicos acontecimientos y los privados casos que me interesen toda impresi n de lo que veo y oigo y hasta las propias melancol as o las fugaces dulzuras que en la soledad balancean mi alma sabed asimismo que a la hora presente idea tan saludable pasa del pensar al hacer antes que mi voluntad desmaye que harto s cu n f cilmente baja de la clara firmeza a la vaguedad perezosa agarro el primer pedazo de papel que a mano encuentro y escribo

1604465 its not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog
1604466 i thought coach mike johnstone would go on the court and sit on the ball before he would let that happen
1604467 we have solar powered parking meters our overall recycling rate is 63 percent we passed a biodiesel ordinance for gas stations are considering a carbon tax and are creating bike boulevards even with recent frowth weve reduced our carbon footprint by one percent while the rest of the nation has increased by 16 hows that
1604468 i was very uncomfortable with it at the beginning but it was starting to come around this spring
1604469 then i had a few injuries including an injury to an abdominal muscle thats always hard to come back from when you breathe it hurts when you sleep it hurts
1604470 but i always believed and swung the club well i was feeling good and it was a matter of time before everything clicked its nice to happen before the pga
1604471 i was so uncomfortable with the short putter i said why do i have to struggle with the short putter im more comfortable with the belly putter and that was it i practiced really good a few weeks ago and putted really well last week
1604472 im striking the ball good and making some putts thats a good combination
1604473 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1604474 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1604475 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1604476 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1604477 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1604478 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1604479 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1604480 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1604481 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1604482 i think we have a future as a public service broadcaster provided that we can get ofcom and the government to realise very very quickly that we cannot afford to pay more than the licence and the psb status is worth
1604483 ofcom estimates that to be around 45 million a year its presently costing us over 220 million a year
1604484 if we cant get quick resolution to that then obviously as ofcom itself outlined in its recent consultation paper there is an option for itv to give up its public service status
1604485 its not a threat its a realistic scenario which ofcom itself has proposed
1604486 a whole host of nanny state regulation about where we put advertising minutage how we have to treat our suppliers the contracts we enter into with independent producers are controlled by a regulator
1604487 this is all alice in wonderland this all belongs 20 years ago its so out of date
1604488 we are aware of reports of two british nationals being detained near the national stadium in beijing
1604489 we are in touch with the chinese authorities and are requesting immediate consular access should this information be correct
1604490 ill probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country but i believe its not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living under the occupation of the chinese government
1604491 for years the chinese government has tried to use the olympics to legitimise its illegal occupation of tibet
1604492 at this very moment tibetans are facing the most severe and violent repression they have seen in decades at the hands of the chinese government and we have taken non violent action at this critical time to draw the worlds attention to the crisis gripping tibet
1604493 im a long term tibet supporter and i feel that now is a really critical time for tibet
1604494 we did this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool
1604495 they are whitewashing their human rights record on tibet so our action today shines a spotlight on those atrocities
1604496 in march tibetans took to the streets risking everything in their calls for justice and human rights and we stand today with this action in solidarity with those calls
1604497 they have been involved in tibetan issues for many years and iain knows many tibetans in the uk
1604498 for them this is a really important action to be part of and i know they were aware of the risks involved but they just felt it was very important to be there at this moment
1604499 the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do
1604500 the one thing ive wanted to do in my life is make a difference by inspiring other people

1604520 my mom taught me how to sew but i really started sewing in college when i started making things for friends
1604521 i get excited every spring when new fabrics come out i like to use bright eye catching colors theres a few designers i follow amy butler heather bailey joel dewberry ana maria horner i get fabric online at joanns and the scrap exchange
1604522 when my friends here started having children i wanted to get a present for them that didnt require batteries or electricity
1604523 a friend and i designed the interactive play quilt we sat down with a piece of graph paper and i drew out the design
1604524 i pick out all the fabrics individually and each quilt is different theyre mostly done by machine and the hand part is i sew the border on the backing ive done themes like ocean life or a stars and planets animals and sports
1604525 i was the 209th shop now there are thousands my first item was a purse another crafter from clayton ended up buying it totally randomly i was so excited the trick about etsy is people shop in categories so the more different kinds of items you have the more visible you are if you havent listed something in a year your product is going to be buried
1604526 coin pouches have been a draw from the beginning as well as tote bags and handbags
1604527 id get bored if i had to make everything the same
1604528 there are forums and workshops i could easily spend eight hours a day on the etsy site

1604533 why on earth would i want to read a book written by some guy who led a band that never achieved any recognizable level of mainstream success
1604534 i bet ken would like this book he should do an unheard music on luna
1604535 knows some will see the cover as a gimmick but he says he thinks the technology behind it which has been used for supermarket displays but never embedded in a magazine speaks to the possibilities of print
1604536 i have been frustrated with the lack of forward movement in the magazine industry the possibilities of print have just begun in two years i hope this looks like cellphones did in 1982 or car phones
1604537 were excited that the mens health issue is hitting the newsstands today a lot of hard work and planning went into this campaign on both sides
1604538 now publishers and advertisers will have a truly unique and personal way to communicate with their readers through the one device nearly everyone is carrying on them at all times a mobile device
1604539 is building mass and dare we say it even real momentum as major publishers and advertisers adopt a pair of technologies centered on the cellphone
1604540 you got a video back of the host of that show drinking animal blood
1604541 what it really does is narrow that transactional gap for advertisers that takes you from not only print media to mobile but to actual transactions
1604542 the value of digital is that its a productive medium
1604543 mobile starts to bring that to other channels that have been one dimensional like print

1604550 my instinctive response to that feeling was to want to get a grip on something to hold on to the place i was leaving or grasp for the place i am going to i stopped and breathed for a moment and then chose not to hold on
1604551 how will you ever get there in this kind of weather my good man
1604552 my heart got there first so its easy for the rest of me to follow
1604553 how can you be so happy when we are still suffering
1604554 if you let yourself go fully and enjoy this moment then you will forget about us
1604555 oh look at that amazing sunrise over the south coast feel the sun on my skin feel the amazing freedom of walking alone and safe revel in the pleasure of the moment this is perfection this is bliss

1604560 deep down i believe that i can make changes in the world by deepening my own compassion by learning how to more consistently practice loving kindness in the world and by learning the power of being fully present in every moment but the feelings come in powerful waves feelings of guilt sadness and anger im learning to ride the waves not to resist them and im trusting in this process
1604561 would to god that all party names and unscriptural phrases and forms which have divided the christian world were forgot and that we might all agree to sit down together as humble loving disciples and at the feet of our common master hear his word to abide in his spirit and to transcribe his life in our own
1604562 oh if the stars above were mine id give them all to you cause only you you make them shine just like i want them to
1604563 how cool is it that this incredible woman is my friend
1604564 the lord jesus christ who by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body
1604565 if the spirit of god the spirit of jesus the messiah dwells in you says paul then the one who raised the messiah from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies as well through his spirit who dwells in you
1604566 it is not enough for the priests and ministers of the future to be moral people well trained eager to help their fellow humans the central question is are the leaders of the future truly men and women of god people with an ardent desire to dwell in gods presence to listen to gods voice to look at gods beauty to touch gods incarnate word and to taste fully gods infinite goodness
1604567 our challenge as followers of the way of jesus always is to do this as the people of joy and gratitude that we are called to be

1604569 in todays individualistic culture we need liturgy to establish us in community in a culture that values spontaneity liturgy grounds us in something enduring in a culture that assumes truth is a product of the mind liturgy helps us experience truth in both mind and body in a world demanding instant gratification and immediate relevance liturgy gives us patience to perceive a deeper relevance and joy that the larger culture can hardly perceive
1604570 dialect aint a zack science baby you do dialect and you think you got it just right reppazent it percisely and twenty years later it all seems quaint and cute and unbearable like reading the emperor jones aloud because people dont speak dialect they speak at and around and toward and with it sliding from level to level as they understand speech and as need dictates
1604571 beyond this hegemony of corporate and institutional consensus however beyond the purview of uncannily lifelike blockbusters like jurassic park and the whitney biennial everything that grows in the domain of culture that acquires constituencies and enters the realm of public esteem does so through the accumulation of participatory investment by people who show up no painting is ever sold nor essay written nor band booked nor exhibition scheduled that is not the consequence of previous social interaction of gossip body language fashion dish and telephone chatter nothing transpires that does not float upon the ephemeral substrata of word of mouth on the validation of schmooze everyone who participates knows this and knows as well that it doesnt cost a dime you just show up behave as you wish say what you will and live with the fleeting often unexpected consequences of your behavior at this bedrock level the process through which works of art are socialized looks less like a conspiracy than a slumber party
1604572 it takes all kinds to make this world doesnt it

1604744 i am asking you to stop this dangerous shipment of radioactive material bound for idaho for the sake of a clean environment for the sake of precedent and for the safety of our children
1604745 accepting this waste in the united states is poor public policy and environmentally unsound for idaho
1604746 every male or female citizen of the united states eighteen years old who has resided in this state and in the county where he or she offers to vote for the period of time provided by law if registered as provided by law is a qualified elector
1604747 shall have resided within the legislative district one year next preceding the general election at which he offers his candidacy
1604748 the analysis wrongfully bootstraps the qualified elector status necessary for voting into the qualifications necessary to be a member of the state senate
1604749 nowhere does the constitution require a candidate to be a registered voter one year prior to the general election for which the candidate stands
1604750 record waste volumes made possible by recent capital investments helped us deliver record operating profits for the quarter
1604751 while our idaho site led the way recent investments in new waste treatment and storage capacity at our texas and nevada sites helped each of these operations deliver superior performance as well
1604752 our other industry revenue increased 129 in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007 this increase was due primarily to a large project for an electric utility customer which was shipped to our grand view idaho site in the first quarter of 2008

1604817 ive been trying to get grapes from grower hoot smith for several years and finally convinced him to share some the long mild summer of 2005 like a burgundian summer made for lengthy hang time we picked in small batches making four passes through the vineyard
1604818 but that was not the way the family did it and here i am
1604819 never eat at a restaurant where the pepper grinder is bigger than your date
1604820 but its rather hardy easy to grow and is a large producer but its too light a grape to make into a ful bodied dry red wine that makes it perfect for a dry rose
1604821 and it sounds good but when do you add the alcohol
1604822 are you the pollacks let me tell you what happened to us at caf ooops
1604823 the fresh clarity of salt and lime that magic combination
1604824 our food is obviously worth it you me the customer are obviously the problem
1604825 the major loser was labrusca grapes like concord and catawba
1604826 we had16 acres of concords half two years old and half three years old and ready to produce a first crop all gone
1604827 we had bumper crops and excellent wine with the 2006 and 2005 vintages
1604828 and there will be plenty of our wine available at the tasting room and all our retail outlets
1604829 we cut our portfolio almost in half in 1995 and weve slowly been increasing production ever since we make fewer wines but i think theyre better this is the first release of this wine its a new one but we like it
1604830 overall our quality level is excellent and were extremely competitive in our price ranges theres always room for improvement of course but i think that is coming from some of our new vineyards were especially proud of our bordeaux style reds in 95 they made up one third of our wines now theyre two thirds
1604831 because we havent made enough wine yet but the idea to go organic was not just a decision about wine it came from the fact that we know it is vital to take better care of the land and the environment as well as the grapes
1604832 they were all around me when i was a boy
1604833 and it just seemed natural for me to work with them as i grew older
1604834 we have cooler nights because of the breeze from the bay
1604835 the soil is stony like italy but has good drainage so that the vines dont get their feet wet it isnt the most fertile soil so it makes the vines work a little harder and thats a good thing too
1604836 be patient and you will be rewarded with excellent food
1604837 it may look like a mess but that is o k
1604838 and all the advice indicated that california was the place to grow the grapes and they also told me about andre tchelistcheff as the man to help me make wine
1604839 i went to northern california i met andre i bought the first property that has become clos pegase and we began
1604840 it mixes well with beer adding alcohol caffeine and unique flavor it can also be chilled and served as a shooter
1604841 what the heck its inexpensive and i dont want to look like some wimp
1604842 this was a vintage marked by the fact that there was always fruit between the rows most years i make three passes through the vineyard to thin the crop this year i needed five
1604843 ive brought you syrup but i think theyre sweet enough i dont use it on them
1604844 or use frozen puff pastry but only the kind made with all butter
1604845 step it up theyre running out of some things already
1604846 we were surprised to find it in patagonia but we think the results so far show that we did the right thing
1604847 i had no idea there was anything like this down here
1604848 was because i was jealous of all the wine students who were not only allowed but encouraged to drink and they all seemed to be having a lot more fun than i was
1604849 while some of the shiraz or syrah vines go back more than a hundred years
1604850 a different wine with a different feeling to be drunk in a different context i think its ideal for people just getting into the enjoyment of drier wines

1604852 dont you think this town has too many italian restaurants
1604853 instead of asking the diners if they want a rose i just come out and suggest it pointing out that the wine is dry not sweet and that it is served chilled a popular point during a st louis summer

1604857 seth talks about diet and working out with a trainer to get ready to play brit he ended the segment by doing a running dive 17 feet across a swimming pool set up on 53rd street while wearing a black business suit and tie seth lost his glasses during the stunt but managed to come in fourth in the purina diving competition for dogs it was a cool segment and it looks like hes already lost some weight
1604858 and it keeps getting postponed and each time it gets postponed the chances of it getting made seem to decrease its never been officially over so theres always that in a heartbeat i would drop whatever i had going on to do that that movie and what i get to do in it is like nothing ive ever seen or would ever get a chance to do again
1604859 knowing that we were doing a slightly more comic take on batman for this and when i say that its not that were doing spongebob or pinky and the brain or smurfs we are making a batman cartoon but within that we are allowing batman to have a sense of humor and for some of the other characters to have a sense of humor to laugh at the situation which is not really what weve done in the past at all with the specific character of batman
1604860 theres no reason why we necessarily have to use the same three or four that are still around
1604861 i mean batmans got a wide variety a rogues gallery certainly we used two in the first movie that hadnt been in the films before its really up to chris to decide and he has not decided whether or not he wants to go back to the well again
1604862 after everything that went into the first film its important to make sure that nothing is rushed and we come out with a fantastic second film

1605197 oh my gosh what else is there in this world besides weed
1605198 we are an easter people and alleluia is our song
1605199 just now in the market place i was jostled by a man in the crowd and when i turned i saw it was mr death he looked at me and made a threatening gesture please lend me your horse because i want to go to samara where mr death will not be able to find me
1605200 why did you make a threatening gesture to my servant when you saw him this morning
1605201 it was only a start of surprise i was astonished to see him in baghdad because i have an appointment with him tonight in samara
1605202 i just wanted to thank you guys for serving our country the meal is on me today
1605203 the human kind never started out by being nice its just a habit we pick up we are actually meant and are the most cruel being on this planet being mean is normal being cruel is to be a specialist
1605204 love is nothing more than the evolution of being nice it never was meant to exist we just want to believe in something that doesnt involve the belief one was meant to travel alone
1605205 religion was also created to make us believe that there is a force stronger than us or beyond the physical realm of our reach that we can rely on when we are hurting the most
1605206 people arent willing to accept that this is it were here to die be born grow old and die we fight each other because of the general belief of existence of in a single sentence means we are meant to live to fight to struggle until our last breath not to love but rather to hate
1605207 i want to help the world i want to save it somehow but if it becomes pure and kind what will happen to it will it implode and destroy itself is it just better to let the earth die will harm and suffering always exist can we not exist without it can we not have the strength to pack our bags and money and just travel the world helping others in need does the world not allow that isnt that how he intended for us to do it not by some legal action
1605208 is it considered heartless to be told that one made a mistake and ignore about the change is it mean to be told a flaw and brush it off am i not capable of giving up when i should to stop chasing what is the impossible is this my end
1605209 relationships that are a cause of emotional pain exist in our world for what reason when something is not needed when it hurts someone shouldnt we just get rid of it when it becomes a nuisance shouldnt it just be shut up when one becomes anything disliked that one should understand that his or her time is up and that being around will just cause more agony
1605210 lately ive been trying to retain good memories but only can think of bad ones no one lives withour regrets but maybe im just taking it too far then it hit me ill disappear from everyone just like old friends do heh all of this the drama the flutuation of love for love all in vein i i wonder who will remember me people will flip through there year books and not know a single mind or if they do remember theyll forget mine

1605235 you will probably feel two desires one a desire to give help due to your herd instinct the other a desire to keep out of danger due to the instinct of self preservation but you will find inside you in addition to these two impulses a third thing which tells you that you ought to follow the impulse to help and suppress the impulse to run away now this thing that judges between two instincts that decides which should be encouraged cannot itself be either of them

1605250 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small doesnt serve the world theres nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we are all meant to shine as children do we are born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us its not just in some of us its in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
1605251 you have big credit losses that make it harder to get new credit which means the economy starts to slow down and foreclosures go up
1605252 then you get even bigger credit losses which makes banks even less willing to lend and you keep spiraling down
1605253 yes and the consecration of my people was greater too
1605254 over the past three years energy prices have risen enormously petrol costs are up 31 per cent and diesel up 49 per cent
1605255 of the small businesses we surveyed 44 per cent said they had no choice but to pass on rising costs and risk customers taking their business elsewhere increases are not just restricted to the fuel and energy market so far this year bt has increased its standard business prices for national calls from 8p per minute to 9p per minute and local calls from 4p per minute to 4 5p per minute
1605256 i am extremely concerned at the 35 per cent increase in prices from british gas
1605257 it is alarming to learn that while thousands of our members are suffering some of these companies are reaching record profits these are exceptional times and everyone should make sacrifices including the petrol and gas companies we would urge these companies to keep prices down as much as possible and to react to lower international oil prices as quickly as possible
1605258 he was very calm but i was extremely surprised i went straight home and switched on the news
1605259 i came in early the next morning and people were like zombies as we heard about the queues forming at branches and how the run on the bank was getting worse there was a feeling the bank was about to collapse
1605260 lots of people felt they had been let down by the directors that was their first thought not about the regulators or the government they asked why the board had paid themselves large bonuses only for us to almost go bust
1605261 people found themselves having quite a complicated relationship with the bank supporting the company on the one hand but not those running it
1605262 many of the people ive spoken to feel quite sick at what went on and will gladly take voluntary redundancy they want to get out and start afresh
1605263 people believe even after almost a year has passed that the decisions were made by the executives and they are the reason the company crashed and redundancy is looming
1605264 i love the house but we paid 151 000 and the mortgage is 168 500 we dont want to sell it but in any case the valuers say its now worth 150 000 we had to move to an interest only loan in april to cut costs but it is still costing us 150 a month more than before were on this rate for a year but now i worry that it wont get any better and we could be in this situation for years to come
1605265 every month we look around at mortgages and ive set northern rock on my google alerts page so i watch everything thats going on there were trying to do everything we can to keep the house
1605266 at the end of the day it the equity capital will be recouped through the ultimate value of the bank
1605267 shaking up the balance of power after winning seven seats in the countrys parliament
1605268 importance of having better and safer transport connections for the north of scotland
1605269 i said look not sniff look down on a single moment sixty two years ago the moment in which you remade time the moment when you allowed mankind to see itself as it was in a single flash of eternity
1605270 ok so i let them drop an atom bomb on hiroshima it was a strategic decision true it involved some collateral damage but in total it saved more lives than would have been lost if i hadnt
1605271 yes and it also put a full stop to the end of a festival of human beastliness and mutual murder and more than that it was a sign a warning to humanity that unless the stupid bastards stop finding ever more beastly ways of killing each other and poisoning the planet they will commit suicide turn your green and lovely land into a dead rock spinning uncounted years in the emptiness of space a place where to all intents and purposes life love and laughter never existed that was the message
1605272 there hasnt been a nuclear war and once that heroic traitor klaus fuchs had sent the recip for the bomb to russia the message was inescapable humanity must either give up the idea that nuclear fission was a weapon of war or commit suicide
1605273 at least nobody has let off another nuclear weapon yet
1605274 but the military industries stood by the need to have more and better intercontinental missiles because they claimed that if they didnt have more than their potential foes their nation would be undefended
1605275 that was bullshit total dangerous bullshit but at the same time it served a greater human need than truth it served the peoples need to feel they were defended against the terrible might of the imaginary enemys ever growing arsenal of nuclear weapons also by pretending that nuclear weapons gave military might according to the quantities held the western powers were hoping it could bankrupt the soviet union and cause it to give up the competition thus the us and its allies thought it might get back the prize of world domination which sole possession of the atomic bomb might have given them it was a vain pointless contest but it gave people the impression that they were being defended
1605276 we watched otherwise honourable statesmen come out with resounding porkies like the laughable
1605277 if we are resolute in our determination to combat any aggression with all the weapons at our command then at the nuclear brink we can be certain that our enemies will pull back
1605278 needless to say our enemies would be telling themselves the same thing the other way round and we would see both sides approaching the nuclear brink resolutely being certain that if they press on the other side is absolutely sure to pull back
1605279 that was natos defence policy for europe in the 1980s and if it had ever been put to the test it would have led straight to death
1605280 nor would there be any institutions or way of life left to defend
1605281 the great enemy of truth is fear and although those pieces of resounding rubbish had the effect of inspiring many hundreds of sensible people to join the campaign for nuclear disarmament the majority of people egged on by campaigns of vilification by hm government against the traitorous cnd preferred the official fairy tale later the dissolution of the imagined enemy the soviet union did make things a bit difficult for the nuclear arms trade but now they have tried another track they will keep the big nukes ready in reserve and quietly concentrate on developing small scale versions for use as starters
1605282 the nukes are still being categorised and piled up as weapons of war and the moment the starters fly the big ones will follow
1605283 when your loved ones are frightened they lose the ability to think
1605284 your world will bring about its own end and destroy everything in it as a result of a small semantic quibble which a child of five could have answered
1605285 she is not my mummy she is a stranger she took me from my mummy they took me from my holiday

1605353 youre never going to tackle global warming by cutting economic growth or your living standards and whatever people might want us to do there the political reality is that it isnt going to happen
1605354 i do indeed and a right pigs ear youre making of it its my job to sow discord among the teeming masses so that you can comfort them and tidy things up its been like that for yonks
1605355 so the moment my back is turned you unload a gross crapulous heap of contention on the world one that was quiescent for years and shove a spike into it

1605362 this has been a slow distillation over a few thousand years in which gradually sensible people have learned to live together and have identified certain actions that are not acceptable to the community on the grounds that they do damage to others and to their welfare the essential criterion the deciding factor is that the evidence must be indisputable and that actual damage must have been suffered the essence the basis of law is that it considers the case it does not judge what a person is but what he or she does all right so far
1605363 your honour is being a bit simplistic but ill go along with that
1605364 then there is something called religious law which is not law at all but superstition
1605365 the proposal to adopt into law one aspect of a religious injunction and its consequent general application including possibly to those who may abhor the religion from which it originates requires that the new law be absolutely disconnected from its religious origin
1605366 isnt that what is being proposed it sounds very reasonable to me so what are you beefing about
1605367 the immediate screaming reaction of the tabloids to what your hairy agent announced was absolutely human and natural as a reaction it didnt make sense but people are not ruled by sense they are ruled by fear by an overwhelming desire for basic safety
1605368 no the separation between law and religious injunction has got to be absolute and stay that way otherwise fear will come back into the land and history will go back to a time of turmoil that even you have forgotten
1605369 fear and injustice are your department or so i thought

1605384 sustainability is earned income inherently more sustainable than other forms of income for social entrepreneurs under what conditions is it most likely to be sustainable is sustainability the right measure for assessing financial strategies boschee nad mcclurg claimed that as long as nonprofits continue to be dependent on contributions from individuals grants from foundations subsidies from government and other forms of largesse they will never become sustainable or self sufficient but it is not clear that earned income is intrinsically more reliable than all other sources a few failures have been documented a thoughtful research agenda would also explore the notion of sustainability in some depth if we want to promote sustainability we would be urging the creation of endowments even large multinational corporations can only expect to live forty or fifty years on average the life expectancy for smaller businesses is much lower with one survey estimating 12 5 years for all firms

1605401 over the past two decades nonprofit organizations have been hectored to become increasingly businesslike
1605402 kuttner argues that the process by which a community based non profit hospital becomes transformed into a chain bought for profit entity negates the fundamental legal criterion for a nonprofit organization the non distribution constraint
1605403 the concept of the third space suggests that the third sector may not primarily be about organizational structures nonprofits instead of corporations or governments rather the special contribution of this realm of human activity may rest in a particular combination of spirit and organization
1605404 this book investigates unfair competition when two types of organizations engaged in identical commercial activities are treated differently under the law there is unfair competition
1605405 whenever a nonprofit produces goods and services in competition with for profits simple equity demands that the nonprofit be subject to the same tax laws pay the same postal rates and be governed by the same regulations as its profit seeking counterparts in short if a nonprofit wants to operate a commercial enterprise it should set up a for profit subsidiary
1605406 to cope with these cuts nonprofit organizations have turned to other sources of funds in general they have managed to offset most of the government cutbacks in the process however the major source of net income has not been private charity but service fees and charges in other words forced by budget cuts to become less governmental nonprofit agencies have responded not by becoming more charitable but by becoming more commercial
1605407 wow that man really cant act he can tilt his head and take off his sunglasses but wow he cant act
1605408 stop niggling about your home made house rules what i want to know is important what happened to all that money
1605409 but high finance doesnt exist high finance isnt real it is a vast on going confidence trick
1605410 theres too much of it ill try to give you a fairly typical example only listen
1605411 basically it is all about money which also doesnt exist or rather is in itself worthless
1605412 you cant mend the roof with it money is just a token by which the giver undertakes when requested to hand over to the receiver material of a certain agreed value ok
1605413 so money is like a sort of i o u the only difference is that the receiver can keep the tokens and stack them up rather than reconverting them into goods which he may not want at that particular moment but he does this on the assumption that the tokens will continue to have their true value in terms of goods
1605414 that sounds reasonable enough at least its preferable to plain barter one can have enough onions
1605415 and so as the money tokens are assumed to have a value people either put them in a box under the bed or get together with others who have some money and set up a bank which is there to keep the money safe this banks job is to lend the money carefully to people who need it for their projects and in return the bank gets back more money than it lent that allows it to add interest money to the original depositors heap while keeping the depositoors money safe so that they can have it back whenever they want it
1605416 nothing really in fact it is the basis of the growth of what they call civilization
1605417 but it only works if the projects that the bank lend money to are going to be able to pay it back and also so long as the bank doesnt lend out more money than it is holding for its depositors taking a chance on the outstanding loans being repaid before anybody notices that they have lent out more than they are holding in the kitty
1605418 the bank just borrows some more to cover it you see so long as they can keep the people whose money they look after convinced that it is safe with them the banks can do exactly what they like with it
1605419 it would be all right if the depositors had some say in what the banks were doing with their money but they were long ago persuaded to sell out to shareholders who now own the bank and appoint people to run it as a business paying them fees and large salaries to use the depositors money to make more money not for the depositors but for the share holders
1605420 because the depositors money hasnt been stolen it has just been quietly borrowed so long as the bank can find the money to pay them the interest the depositors will believe it is still there
1605421 but suppose the depositors lose confidence and decide they want to take their money back
1605422 well yes that can be a bit of a problem the money may not be there thats why i said the whole thing is based on a giant confidence trick if the bank still has the original money that was deposited with it intact it can give it back honestly and with no trouble
1605423 but if the bank has already spent all the money on making loans that it cant get back and has pocketed the fees it will really be in schnuck then it will either have to borrow like mad from other banks and these other banks will charge them a high rate of interest because the chance of their getting it back is very slim or failing that the bank will have to go cap in hand to the treasury that is the taxpayer and ask to be baled out if necessary by printing more pieces of promissory paper money
1605424 but for the sake of the whole industry of money making money somebody perhaps a consortium of other banks might see that it would be wise to bale it out they would do this because if any one bank couldnt pay back its depositors it would have to close its doors then every depositor in the country who had put their savings in a bank would queue up in the streets demanding it back the whole banking system would then implode like a pricked balloon
1605425 you see a bank has a duty to its depositors to lend wisely on their behalf making sure that the loan is safe and will be paid back thus taking care of the money they are supposed to be looking after but that wasnt profitable enough for the banks shareholders so they started whats called the credit boom in which the banks aggressively sell loans to anybody and everybody even if they havent a cat in hells chance of keeping up the repayments as i said all the banks want is the commission their charge for doing the business which makes their shareholders rich they are eagerly offering credit to anybody who fancies to improve their affluent life style with extra luxuries its been absolutely marvellous like every day has been a birthday
1605426 they wont they cant they couldnt people just have to borrow more to cover the interest payments thus stacking up even more debt
1605427 do you know the current credit debt the amount of money that has now been lent out and spent on fancy goods runs into trillions of pounds many times more than the deposited capital that is supposed to underpin it the outstanding debt is now more than the gross value of the entire country there is simply no way it could ever be repaid its magnificent
1605428 yes but you gave them greed they just worked out a way of using it
1605429 but there certainly wont be any tomorrow if great lumps of hard earned money are being pinched and squirreled away by rich people who just want to become richer forty billion pounds could blast a canal through the atlas mountains and turn the sahara desert into a land flowing with milk and honey
1605430 but youd have a job raising the capital not enough profit in milk and honey

1605449 tidakkah kalian saksikan bahwa kebenaran tidak lagi ditaati dan kebatilan tidak lagi dilarang maka merupakan keharusan bagi seorang mukmin yang berada di tengah situasi dan kondisi semacam ini untuk bersimbah darah syahadah di jalan allah swt
1605450 ya allah sesungguhnya engkaulah yang maha tahu bahwa gerakan kebangkitan protes perlawanan dan peperangan semua ini bukanlah untuk memperebutkan kekuasaan seseorang bukan untuk meraup harta dan perolehan duniawi bukan pula atas dasar kerakusan dunia melainkan untuk mengembalikan ajaran ajaran agama mu untuk mewujudkan perbaikan di bumi mu agar hamba hamba mu yang tertindas merasa aman dan supaya ditegakkan kembali hukum hukum mu yang terabaikan
1605451 ambillah baiat padaku dari warga kota undanglah husain bin ali dan ambil pula baiat darinya jika dia menolak berbaiat padaku maka kirimkan kepalanya kepadaku
1605452 apabila umat ini dipimpin oleh seorang seperti yazid maka ucapkanlah selamat tinggal islam
1605453 aku kira yang firaun nya mereka sudah mati dan kita dipanggil untuk berbaiat
1605454 kalian berdiri siaga di luar dan jika teriakanku terdengar segeralah masuk ke dalam tapi selama teriakanku belum terdengar janganlah kalian masuk
1605455 masyarakat sudah membaiat yazid maslahat islam menuntut demikian aku harap kamu juga membaiatnya
1605456 kalau begitu apa untungnya baiatku di ruangan tertutup ini yang hanya dihadiri oleh tiga orang saja
1605457 apa yang dia katakan itu benar kalau begitu biar nanti saja
1605458 sungguh aku tidak bangkit karena kesombongan dan keangkuhan aku bukanlah perusak mufsid atau orang dzalim aku bangkit hanya untuk melakukan reformasi pada umat kakekku aku ingin mengajak pada kebaikan dan mencegah kemungkaran aku berjalan di atas jalan kakek dan ayahku ali bin abi thalib
1605459 barangsiapa menyaksikan kondisi semacam ini dan tidak berusaha mengubahnya maka allah swt pantas mengumpulkannya bersama orang orang yang dzalim sewenang wenang dan orang orang yang mengubah agama allah swt nasibnya akan sama seperti mereka
1605460 wahai hurr semoga allah merahmatimu engkau adalah seorang yang merdeka di dunia ini dan juga di akhirat nanti persis sebagaimana arti nama yang diberikan ibumu kepadamu
1605461 setiap hari adalah hari asyura dan setiap tempat adalah karbala dan setiap bulan adalah bulan muharram
1605462 engkau tahu bahawa seandainya wewenang berada di tanganku pasti akan aku akan melakukan apa yang kau usulkan itu tapi atasanmu ubaidullah bin ziyad tidak mau menerima penyelesaian damai
1605463 ya demi tuhan aku akan terjun ke dalam peperangan yang akibatnya yang paling ringan adalah terpenggalnya kepala kepala dan terpotongnya tangan tangan
1605464 apa yang terjadi dengan dirimu hurr aku bingung melihat tingkahmu demi allah jika aku ditanya siapa orang yang paling pemberani di kalangan pasukan kita niscaya akan ku sebutkan namamu tanpa ragu ragu lagi tapi mengapa engkau begitu gelisah dan cemas
1605465 aku mendapati diriku berada di antara neraka dan syurga dan aku harus memilih di antara keduanya demi allah aku tidak akan memilih selain syurga meskipun tubuhku akan dipotong potong atau dibakar menjadi abu
1605466 saksikanlah dan biarkanlah amirul mukminin tahu bahawa akulah orang pertama yang menembakkan panah kepada tentera husain
1605467 engkau benar benar orang yang bebas seperti nama yang diberikan ibumu kepadamu engkau bebas di dunia dan akhirat
1605468 ini adalah saat yang paling indah dan menyenangkan sebab tak lama lagi kita akan berjumpa yang tuhan
1605469 sahabatku tahukah engkau bahwa sejak muda aku tidak gemar bercanda tapi malam ini aku sangat bahagia sebab jarak antara kita dan surga hanya beberapa saat kita hanya perlu sejenak menari narikan pedang untuk menyambut pedang pedang musuh mencabik cabik tubuh kita lalu terbang ke surga
1605470 kalau begitu tidak alasan bagi kita untuk merasa ragu dan gentar
1605471 ya allah saksikankah pemuda yang paling mirip wajah tutur kata dan perangainya dengan rasul mu kini maju ke medan tempur selama ini kami mengobati kerinduan kepada nabi dengan memandangnya ya allah jauhkan mereka dari barakah bumi ini dan cabik cabiklah barisan mereka
1605472 tuanku selama ini aku hidup sejahtera di rumahmu aku tidak bisa tinggal diam menyaksikan engkau dan keluargamu menghadapi kesulitan ini demi allah aku tidak akan meninggalkanmu sampai darahku bercampur dengan darahmu yang suci
1605473 ya allah putihkan wajahnya masukkanlah ia ke dalam golongan orang orang yang baik dan jangan pisahkan dia dari keluarga muhammad
1605474 aku tidak akan mengambil kembali apa yang telah kupersembahkan untuk islam

1605476 demi allah tidak ada seorangpun di dunia ini yang kucintai dan aku hormati lebih dari dirimu wahai putra rasulullah jika ketulusan cinta ini dapat aku tunjukkan dengan mengorbankan sesuatu yang lebih berharga dari jiwa dan ragaku pasti akan kulakukan

1605480 we had a lot of opportunities that we didnt take we have looked at it and saw that our communication wasnt good so we must play a bit of heads up rugby and see the opportunities
1605481 you will just have to wait until the team announcement
1605482 tuhan berkehendak untuk memerintahkan jihad kepada kita sudah menjadi ketentuan nya bahwa kita semua akan gugur sebagai syahid karenanya bersabarlah menyongsong jihad melawan kekafiran ini
1605483 hai husein rupanya kau tidak sabar untuk merasakan neraka sehingga buru buru menyalakannya di dunia
1605484 hei syimr engkau lebih layak masuk ke neraka dari pada aku
1605485 ya allah husein mu selalu bertawakkal dan menyerahkan diri kepadamu
1605486 wahai kalian semua jangan terburu buru dan gegabah dalam mengambil tindakan pikirkan sejenak dan dengarkanlah kata kata dan nasehatku sebab kalian berhak untuk mendengarnya dariku jika kalian mau mendengar dan memikirkannya jalan kebahagiaan akan terbentang di hadapan kalian jika tidak lakukanlah apa yang kalian maukan dan selesaikanlah urusan ini secepatnya ketahuilah bahwa allah adalah tuanku dialah yang menurunkan kitab suci dan melindungi hamba hambanya
1605487 abbas suruh mereka berhenti sebab masih banyak musibah yang akan mereka alami dan masih banyak kesempatan untuk menguras air mata
1605488 maha suci allah yang telah menjadikan dunia sebagai tempat kefanaan dan menjadikan umat manusia sebagai penonton perubahan yang terjadi di dalamnya karenanya siapa saja yang melihat dunia bagai sesuatu yang agung berarti dia telah menipu dirinya sendiri barang siapa yang terjebak di dalam tipudaya dunia hanya kesengsaraanlah yang dia dapatkan karenanya jangan biarkan dunia menipu kalian sebab dunia akan mengandaskan seluruh harapan dan angan angan pecintanya mengapa kalian cenderung mengikuti orang orang yang hanya akan menjerumuskan kalian ke dalam murka dan amarah allah betapa allah maha baik dan bijaksana dan betapa buruknya kalian sebagai hamba nya wahai kalian yang mengakui ketuhanan nya dan mengaku beriman kepada nabi nya untuk apa kalian mesti memerangi keluarga rasul sungguh syaitan telah merasuki jiwa dan pikiran kalian semoga allah mengandaskan seluruh angan angan kalian wahai warga kufah pikirkan benar benar siapakah diriku bukankah aku anak putri nabi bukankah aku putra washi rasul bukankah aku putra orang yang pertama memeluk agama islam bukankah hamzah penghulu para syuhada adalah paman ayahku bukankah jafar thayyar pamanku lupakah kalian akan sabda nabi tentang diriku dan saudaraku lupakah kalian akan sabda nabi bahwa hasan dan husein adalah penghulu pemuda surga apakah kalian mengira aku berdusta aku bersumpah bahwa aku tidak pernah mengotori lidah ini dengan kata kata dusta jika kalian tidak percaya tanyakan kepada jabir bin abdillah al anshari abu said al khudri sahl bin sad as saidi zaid bin arqam atau anas bin malik mereka akan memberitahu kalian akan kebenaran kata kataku semoga sabda nabi mengenai kami bisa mencegah kalian dari niat menzalimi kami
1605489 hei husein aku pasti akan ragu menyembah tuhan jika aku tahu kebenaran kata katamu
1605490 hei syimr demi allah selama ini engkau beribadah dengan keraguan yang menguasai jiwa dan pikiranmu aku tahu benar bahwa engkau tidak akan memahami apa yang dikatakan oleh tuanku husein sebab allah telah membuat hatimu sekeras batu
1605491 jika kalian masih ragu apakah kalian meragukan bahwa aku adalah anak dari putri nabi kalian demi allah kalian tidak akan menemukan cucu nabi di dunia ini selain diriku celaka kalian apakah aku telah membunuh salah seorang dari kalian sehingga kalian datang untuk menuntut balas dariku apakah aku telah merampas harta kalian sehingga kalian menghunus pedang terhadapku
1605492 wahai syabats bin rab i hajjar bin abjad qais bin asyats zaid bin haritsah bukankah kalian yang menulis surat kepadaku untuk datang dengan mengatakan bahwa buah buah telah masak dan siap dipetik dan seluruh warga kufah akan menjadi bala tentaraku apakah kalian sudah lupa kepada janji dan sumpah setia kalian
1605493 kami tidak tahu apa yang kau maksudkan jalan terbaik bagimu adalah menyerah dan menerima kekuasaan bani umayyah mereka pasti akan memberimu hadiah sebanyak yang kau inginkan mereka tidak akan mencelakakanmu
1605494 hei qais apakah engkau mengira bahwa bani hasyim akan menuntut darah orang selain muslim bin aqil darimu demi allah aku tidak akan mengulurkan tangan kepada para tuanmu aku juga tidak akan pernah takut menghadapi peperangan karena aku hanya berlindung kepada allah tuhanku
1605495 hai husein berbahagailah karena sebentar lagi engkau akan masuk neraka
1605496 aku akan segera bertemu dengan tuhan yang maha pengasih dan penyayang siapakah engkau
1605497 demi allah aku tidak akan pernah memerangi keluarga nabi sebab mereka memiliki kedudukan dan derajat yang tinggi di sisi allah
1605498 wahai warga kufah takutlah kalian akan azab allah aku berdiri di sini untuk menyampaikan nasehat kepada kalian sebab kalian memiliki hak untuk mendengarkannya dariku sampai saat ini kita masih terikat dalam persaudaraan seagama tali ikatan ini tetap ada selama pedang belum memisahkannya tetapi ketika pedang sudah berbicara kita akan terpisah menjadi dua kelompok yang berbeda ketahuilah bahwa allah telah menjadikan keluarga rasul nya sebagai ujian bagi kalian bagaimana kalian memperlakukan mereka allah telah melarang kalian untuk tunduk dan patuh kepada kaum durjana seperti yazid dan ubadillah bin ziyad dia pulalah yang memerintahkan kalian untuk membela anak cucu rasulullah jika tidak tak lama lagi kaum durjana itu akan mencungkil mata kalian memotong kaki dan tangan kalian serta menggantung tubuh kalian di batang korma
1605499 demi allah anak anak fathimah lebih baik untuk dicintai dan dibela daripada anak sumaiyyah jika enggan membela husein sebaiknya kalian tinggalkan medan ini
1605500 hei syimr aku tidak berbicara denganmu sebab kau tak lebih dari seekor binatang demi allah aku menduga bahwa engkau tidak memahami satu ayatpun dari tunggulah kehinaanmu di hari kiamat kelak
1605501 engkau menakut nakutiku dengan kematian demi allah kematian bersama husein lebih menyenangkan dari hidup bersama kalian
1605502 wahai hamba hamba allah sadarlah jangan sampai orang ini menjauhkan kalian dari agama allah demi tuhan syafaat keluarga muhammad tidak akan didapatkan oleh mereka yang membunuh anak cucu rasul dan membantai para pembela mereka
1605503 wahai zuhair sungguh engkau bagaikan seorang mumin berada di keluarga firaun dengan memberikan nasehatmu kepada mereka semoga allah membalasmu dengan balasan yang baik
1605504 wahai penduduk kufah allah telah mengutus muhammad untuk menunjukkan agama yang lurus beliau telah memberikan petunjuk dan mengajak umat kepada jalan allah risalahnya bagaikan pelita yang menerangi kegelapan ketahuilah bahwa mereka yang kini berada di hadapan kalian adalah anak cucu sang nabi karenanya dengan alasan apakah kalian menghalang mereka mengambil air sungai furat
1605505 hei burair singkat saja kami bersumpah untuk membuat husein kehausan dan merasakan dahaga yang tidak akan pernah dialami oleh orang selain dia
1605506 risalah dan pesan kenabian ada di tengah tengah kalian yaitu keluarganya karena itu pikirkan bagaimana kalian mesti bersikap terhadap mereka
1605507 yang kami inginkan adalah husein mau tunduk kepada perintah gubernur kufah ubaidillah bin ziyad
1605508 lupakah kalian bahwa kalian telah menulis surat kepada junjunganku husein dan menyatakan sumpah setia untuk berkorban demi beliau saat ini setelah husein bersedia menjawab panggilan itu dan datang bersama sahabat sahabatnya untuk memenuhi ajakan kalian kalian malah menjual mereka kepada ibnu ziyad alangkah buruknya perlakuan kalian terhadap anak cucu rasulullah semoga allah membuat kalian kehausan di hari pembalasan nanti
1605509 puji syukur kepada tuhan yang telah menunjukkan kepadaku siapakah kalian sebenarnya ya allah aku berlepas tangan dari perbuatan mereka tuhanku balaslah kejahatan yang dilakukan oleh kelompok ini dengan kehinaan saat mereka menghadap mu dan jatuhkanlah laknat dan kemurkaan mu atas mereka
1605510 wahai penduduk kufah antara kita ada kitab suci tuhan dan sunnah kakekku rasulullah tahukah kalian bahwa pakaian yang melekat di tubuhku ini adalah pakaian nabi tahukah kalian bahwa pedang dan perisai yang aku bawa adalah milik kakekku rasululah
1605511 celaka kalian yang telah berbaiat kepada orang seperti dia dan mengacungkan pedang ke arah kami celaka kalian yang memilih untuk menjadi pembela musuh musuh allah yang tidak akan berlaku adil terhadap kalian mengapa kalian justeru memerangi keluarga rasul di saat pedang kaum durjana menguasai kalian dan untuk selanjutnya orang orang zalim itu akan mengotori dunia dengan kezaliman mereka celakalah kalian yang telah mencampakkan kitabullah dan mengubah ubah kandungannya mengapa kalian patuh kepada para pengikut syaitan pendosa durjana dan pelanggar ajaran rasul mengapa kalian justeru mengikuti mereka serta meninggalkan dan tidak membela kami keluarga rasul demi allah bukan kali ini saja kalian melanggar sumpah setia kehidupan kalian sarat dengan pengkhianatan yang telah menyatu dengan kepribadian kalian ketahuilah bahwa ibnu ziyad telah memberiku dua pilihan kehinaan atau pembantaian kami tidak akan pernah memilih kehinaan sebab allah kaum mukiminin dan semua orang bijak tidak akan merelakanku memilih kehinaan mereka tidak akan menerima alasanku mengikuti orang orang durjana itu kini aku bersama sanak keluarga dan sahabat sahabatku yang berjumlah kecil ini bangkit untuk berjuang di jalan allah dan siap untuk meneguk cawan syahadah wahai penduduk kufah ketahuilah bahwa setelah ini kalian tidak akan hidup lama inilah yang diberitahukan oleh ayahku dari kakekku rasulullah wahai warga kufah pikirkanlah untuk selanjutnya selesaikan segera urusan ini ketahuilah bahwa husein hanya berharap kepada allah yang maha besar sebab tak ada satupun makhluk yang hidup kecuali seluruh urusan dan kehidupannya ada di tangan allah sesungguhnya tuhanku di atas jalan yang lurus
1605512 wahai kalian semua jika kami menang itu sudah tradisi namun jika kami hancur ketahuilah bahwa kami tidak akan kalah jika kami berhasil membunuh kemenangan ada pada kami dan jika kami terbunuh kami tetap menang kami bukanlah pengecut dan berhati lemah kami adalah jawara dan pemberani jika kami terbunuh berarti itulah saat kesyahidan dan pengorbanan kami ketika kematian tidak menjemput suatu kaum berarti ketika itu ia sedang merenggut kaum yang lain
1605513 inilah hari yang ditentukan bagi kami dan para pembela kami jika para tokoh dunia kekal kamipun pasti akan kekal sebab kami adalah pemuka umat manusia jika para pemimpin meninggalkan dunia ini menuju ke alam keabadian kamipun juga akan berjalan menuju ke sana
1605514 ya allah jangan kau siramkan hujan rahmat mu kepada kaum ini buatlah mereka hidup di bawah kekuasaan para durjana dudukkanlah budak dari bani tsaqif itu untuk menguasai mereka dan memberi mereka rasa kehinaan engkau tahu bahwa husein selalu berserah diri dan bertawakkal kepadamu engkaulah tempat kami semua kembali
1605515 hei umar apa engkau mengira dengan membunuhku engkau akan diangkat menjadi gubernur rey dan gurgan demi allah engkau tidak akan mendapatkan impian itu kini lakukan apa maumu tapi ingat bahwa setelah kematianku engkau tidak akan mengalami saat bahagia sama sekali aku menyaksikan anak anak kecil di kufah yang bermain main dan melempari kepalamu
1605516 demi allah aku akan menggempur kelompok itu setidaknya aku bisa memenggal kepala dan memotong tangan husein
1605517 ya jika aku bisa tentu aku akan menerima kata katanya tapi ubaidullah bin ziyad menekankan untuk menghabisinya aku tidak punya pilihan lain
1605518 hurr ada apa denganmu mengapa badanmu gemeter seperti ini padahal jika ada yang bertanya kepadaku siapakah jawara kufah aku pasti akan menyebutkan namamu
1605519 muhajir aku berada di persimpangan jalan jalan ke surga dan jalan ke neraka dan aku harus memilih salah satunya demi allah aku hanya menginginkan surga meski harus dibakar hidup hidup
1605520 ya allah aku datang untuk menebus semua kesalahanku dan bertaubat kepada mu terimalah taubatku ini akulah yang telah melukai hati sanak kelurga rasul
1605521 aku menyesali semua kesalahanku apakah taubatku bisa diterima ya allah aku bertaubat kepada mu
1605522 saat meninggalkan kufah aku mendengar suara yang memberiku kabar gembira akan surga dan kini aku berkata sendiri dalam hati celaka aku yang telah diberi kabar gembira tentang surga tapi berniat memerangi cucu rasulullah
1605523 celaka kalian wahai penduduk kufah kalianlah yang telah memanggil cucu rasul untuk datang kepada kalian kalian mengaku bersedia mengorbankan jiwa untuknya tapi kini di saat beliau datang memenuhi panggilan kalian kalian malah menyambutnya dengan pedang terhunus kalian memperlakukannya bagai tawanan perang dan menutup air untuk beliau dan keluarganya betapa buruknya kalian yang memperlakukan cucu nabi sedemikian keji semoga tuhan tidak menghilangkan dahaga kalian
1605524 di mana anak anak saudariku di mana abbas dan adik adiknya
1605525 kalian adalah anak anak saudara perempuanku aku akan memberi kalian keselamatan jangan binasakan diri sendiri tunduklah kepada yazid
1605526 semoga allah melaknatmu dan melaknat keselamatan yang kau janjikan itu semudah itukah engkau memberi kami keselamatan sedangkan jiwa husein putra rasulullah tidak selamat kau menginginkan kami meninggalkannya dan tunduk kepada orang orang terkutuk itu betapa kotornya pikiranmu
1605527 wahai penduduk kufah saksikanlah bahwa aku adalah orang pertama yang membidikkan panah ke pasukan husein sampaikan hal ini kepada gubernur kufah ubaidillah bin ziyad
1605528 bangkitlah wahai para pembela agama allah songsonglah syahadah yang telah menjadi bagian kita anak anak panah ini adalah pesan yang mereka kirim
1605529 kami tidak mengenalmu biarkan zuhair habib atau burair yang datang untuk berduel dengan kami
1605530 abdullah kembalilah ke medan dan korbankanlah dirimu untuk manusia suci dan anak rasul ini demi allah tak akan kubiarkan engkau gugur sendirian aku akan bersamamu menyongsong syahadah
1605531 bukankah beberapa saat lalu engkau mencegahku untuk berkorban demi husein mengapa kini engkau juga ingin terjun ke medan tempur
1605532 jangan kau salahkan diriku baru saja aku mendengar imam husein mengatakan sesuatu
1605533 allah membalas jasa baik kalian yang telah membela keluarga nabi nya ummu wahb kembalilah ke kemah sebab allah tidak memerintahkan wanita untuk berperang
1605534 demi allah aku tidak akan tunduk kepada kemauan kaum durjana ini sampai aku menemui tuhanku dengan tubuh berlumur darah
1605535 wahai penduduk kufah tahukah kalian dengan siapa kalian berduel mereka adalah para jawara yang tak mungkin dikalahkan hujani mereka dengan batu karena cara itulah yang paling tepat untuk menghabisi mereka
1605536 sulit bagiku menyaksikan keadaanmu seperti ini bergembiralah karena sebentar lagi engkau akan pergi ke surga
1605537 jika aku masih bisa hidup lama setelahmu aku siap menerima wasiatmu tapi aku tahu bahwa tak lama lagi akupun akan menyusulmu
1605538 habib sahabatku wasiatku satu satunya adalah jangan sampai engkau meninggalkan husein
1605539 hei kalian semua apakah dengan membunuh muslim kalian sedemikian bersuka cita celaka kalian tahukah kalian bahwa muslim sangat dihormati oleh kaum muslimin demi allah pasukan kafir gentar menghadapi pedangnya dialah jawara yang membuat pasukan musuh ketakutan
1605540 berbahagialah karena engkau kini telah terbang ke surga sana aku berharap tuhan juga memberiku tempat di surga bersamamu
1605541 kembalilah ke kemah semoga allah mengampunimu tuhan tidak mewajibkan jihad atas wanita
1605542 ya allah kuatkanlah tangannya tepatkanlah bidikannya dan berikanlah surga kepadanya sebagai pahala kebaikannya
1605543 wahai abu abdillah jiwaku aku korbankan untukmu lihatlah musuh semakin dekat demi allah tak akan kubiarkan anda gugur sebelum aku mempersembahkan jiwa ini untukmu dengan bersimbah darah namun sebelum pedang mencabik cabik tubuhku aku ingin shalat dhuhur di belakangmu untuk terakhir kalinya
1605544 engkau masih ingat akan kewajiban shalat semoga allah memasukkanmu ke dalam golongan para penegak shalat dan yang selalu mengingat nya benar sudah saatnya untuk melaksanakan shalat dhuhur
1605545 hei hushain kau kira shalat cucu nabi tidak diterima allah sedang shalatmu diterima
1605546 darah habib bin madhahir akan aku tuntut kelak di hadapan allah
1605547 engkau benar benar bebas seperti nama yang diberikan ibumu kepadamu sungguh engkau bebas di dunia dan akhirat
1605548 ya allah kutuklah kelompok pengkhianat janji ini seperti engkau melaknat kaum ad dan tsamud ya allah sampaikanlah salamku kepada nabi mu
1605549 ya bergembiralah karena surga telah menantimu tak lama lagi aku akan menyusulmu sampaikan salamku kepada kakeku rasulullah
1605550 sahabat sahabatku pintu surga telah terbuka menantikan kedatangan kalian sungai sungai surga dan buah buahnya tak sabar menunggu kalian nabi dan para syuhada berbaris untuk menyambut kalian karenanya teruskan pengorbanan kalian demi keluarga nabi semoga allah mengampuni kalian semua
1605551 demi allah aku hanya menyaksikan kebaikan dalam takdir dan kehendak tuhan dialah yang membimbingku ke jalan kebaikan sedangkan takdir telah membawamu menjadi budak kejahatan
1605552 hei burair ingatkah engkau waktu kita bersama sama di kabilah bani hawazin saat itu engkau mengatakan bahwa pemimpin kelompok yang mendapat hidayah adalah ali bin abi thalib
1605553 sampai kinipun aku masih mengatakannya aku bersaksi bahwa engkau termasuk dalam golongan mereka yang sesat kini aku tantang engkau untuk bermubahalah dan meminta allah untuk menurunkan laknat nya atas orang yang berdusta di antara kita berdua
1605554 celaka engkau yang berniat membunuh burair bin khudhair qari terkemuka di kufah biarkan dia
1605555 celaka engkau hei kaab engkau telah menghunus pedang terhadap cucu rasulullah dan membunuh pemuka para qari kufah burair bin khudhair demi allah aku tidak akan berbicara lagi denganmu selamanya betapa besar dosa yang telah engkau lakukan
1605556 hei penduduk kufah aku sungguh mengkhawatirkan terulangnya peristiwa ahzab dan perbuatan umat nuh kaum ad dan kaum tsamud karena perbuatan kalian aku mengkhawatirkan hari di mana kalian saling menyalahkan sedang allah tidak akan mengampuni kalian lagi barang siapa yang disesatkan oleh allah maka tidak akan ada yang bisa memberinya petunjuk tinggalkan husein dan jangan kotori tangan kalian dengan darahnya jika tidak allah pasti akan menghukum kalian dengan azab nya yang pedih
1605557 semoga allah merahmatimu mereka telah terjerumus ke dalam jurang dan akan merasakan azab tuhan
1605558 aku juga berpikir sama kalau begitu mari kita menghadap imam dan meminta izin beliau untuk maju ke medan tempur
1605559 wahai abu abdillah ketahuilah bahwa di muka bumi ini tak ada seorangpun yang mulia dan lebih kucintai dari dirimu andai saja aku bisa menyelamatkanmu dari pembantaian ini meski dengan mengorbankan sesuatu yang lebih berharga dari jiwa ini aku pasti akan melakukannya tanpa ragu saksikanlah bahwa aku mati dengan membawa keyakinan akan agamamu dan agama ayahmu
1605560 hei inilah si raja singa abis bin abi syaib asy syakiri siapa yang berani menghadang jalannya pasti akan terjungkal bersimbah darah
1605561 inilah saatnya kutanggalkan pakaian untuk merasakan maut dengan seluruh tubuh ini
1605562 demi allah saat abis maju menyeruak ke barisan pasukan ibnu saad sekitar dua ratus orang yang berada di hadapannya lari tunggang langgang menyelamatkan diri
1605563 wahai jaun engkau berada di sisi kami untuk mendapatkan perlindungan dan hidup terjamin sekarang aku persilahkan engkau untuk meninggalkan tempat pembantaian ini
1605564 aku selama ini hidup senang bersama anda bagaimana aku harus meninggalkan anda di saat anda menghadapi kesulitan seperti ini tuanku aku adalah seorang budak yang tak jelas asal usulnya sedangkan kulitku berwarna hitam karena itu izinkan aku untuk masuk surga sehingga badanku ini menjadi harum dan kulitku memutih demi allah aku bersumpah tidak akan pernah meninggalkanmu sampai darahku yang hitam ini bercampur dengan darahmu yang suci
1605565 ya allah putihkanlah kulit wajahnya dan berilah dia tempat bersama nabi mu muhammad dan keluarganya
1605566 ayah anak ini sudah gugur mungkin ibunya akan sangat terpukul jika anak itu maju ke medan tempur dan terbunuh suruh dia kembali ke kemah
1605567 ibukulah yang memerintahkan aku untuk bertempur bahkan dia sendiri yang memakaikan pakaian perang ini di badanku kini izinkanlah aku untuk mempersembahkan pengorbanan demimu wahai putra rasul
1605568 apa yang telah kupersembahkan di jalan allah tidak akan kuambil kembali
1605569 memang aku wanita tua yang lemah kekuatan dan kepintaranku telah lenyap sedang tubuhku juga semakin layu aku bersumpah untuk memukul kalian sekuat tenaga demi membela anak anak fathimah
1605570 hari ini aku akan segera bertemu dengan ayahmu ali yang aku yakini sebagai washi dan penerus risalah nabi
1605571 wahai putra husein kasihanilah keterasingan kami yang tak kuasa berpisah darimu
1605572 ya allah saksikanlah bahwa pemuda yang paling mirip dengan rasul mu muhammad maju ke medan tempur selama ini jika kami rindu kepada nabi kami selalu melampiaskannya dengan menatap wajahnya
1605573 hei ibnu saad semoga allah memutus tali keturunanmu yang tidak mengindahkan kekerabatanku dengan rasulullah allah swt telah memuliakan adam nuh ibrahim dan keluarga imran atas semua makhluk nya dan kami adalah keturunan orang orang suci itu
1605574 anakku tak lama lagi engkau akan segera bertemu dengan kakekmu rasulullah yang akan memberimu air dari telaga surga dan engkau tak akan merasakan dahaga lagi selamanya
1605575 semoga allah menumpas mereka yang telah membunuhmu sungguh betapa kejinya mereka yang menginjak injak kehormatan rasul dan membantai para kekasih allah anakku setelah kepergianmu dunia ini tak lagi berarti
1605576 mereka adalah kaum pengkhianat habisi dan bantai mereka sebab mereka datang untuk membantai kita
1605577 wahai saudara saudara sepupuku songsonglah kematian dengan tabah demi allah tidak ada lagi kehidupan dunia setelah ini
1605578 celakalah mereka yang membunuhmu kakekmu rasulullah tidak akan memaafkan mereka
1605579 adik adikku bersiap siaplah untuk menyerang pasukan kafir itu demi memperoleh keridhaan allah
1605580 benar tapi demi allah dadaku terasa sesak sekali izinkan aku untuk menuntut darah para syuhada
1605581 adikku pergilah dan usahakan untuk mendapatkan sedikit air untuk anak anak yang kehausan
1605582 meski aku kehilangan tangan kanan namun aku tetap akan membela agama dan junjunganku al husein putra rasul
1605583 di maka kalian yang telah membunuh adikku ke mana kalian yang telah meluluhkan lengan kananku
1605584 segala puji bagi allah yang telah memberiku kemudahan menanggung segala penderitaan ini ya allah semoga derita ini tidak memudahkan terpisahnya nyawa dari tubuh ini tuhanku aku tahu bahwa engkau telah memberikan kemenangan kepada kami dan engkaulah yang akan menuntut balas dari mereka akan perbuatan ini engkau pulalah yang menjadikan musibah yang mereka timpakan kepadaku sebagai simpanan untuk hari akhirat ya allah engkau telah menyksikan sendiri bahwa mereka telah membunuh orang yang paling mirip dengan rasul mu
1605585 husein kembalikan anak itu sebab dia telah ditunggu oleh perawatnya di surga
1605586 ingat husein adalah putra ali yang akan menjungkalkan semua jawara arab karena itu kepung dia dari segala penjuru
1605587 hei para budak abu sufyan jika kalian tidak beragama dan tidak percaya akan hari akhirat jadilah orang yang bebas dan merdeka
1605588 akulah yang berperang dengan kalian bukan wanita wanita itu selama aku masih hidup jangan sekali kali kalian mendekati mereka
1605589 mengapa engkau ingin membasahi kerongkongan dengan air itu sedangkan perkemahan keluargamu diserang oleh pasukan musuh
1605590 siapkanlah diri kalian untuk menghadapi banyak musibah besar setelah ini wahai keluarga kenabian allah adalah sebaik baik penolong kalian dialah yang akan menjaga kalian dari gangguan mereka allah telah menentukan akhir yang baik bagi kalian dan akan mengazab musuh musuh itu dengan siksaan yang amat pedih ingatlah bahwa setiap musibah yang kalian alami akan diganti dengan kenikmatan kenikmatan yang tak terkira karena itu jangan kalian lemahkan diri kalian dengan jerit tangis
1605591 hei serang dan habisi dia jika tidak dia pasti akan mengobrak abrik barisan kalian
1605592 tiada daya dan upaya menlainkan dari allah yang maha tinggi lagi maha agung
1605593 hei husein lihatlah sungai yang tampak segar itu tapi sayangnya engkau tidak akan pernah merasakan air furat sampai mati kehausan
1605594 ya allah saksikanlah apa yang dilakukan kaum ini terhadapku ya allah binasakanlah mereka jangan engkau biarkan seorangpun dari mereka hidup di bumi ini tuhanku jangan engkau ampuni kesalahan mereka
1605595 hei kalian semua betapa buruknya perlakukan kalian terhadap keluarga nabi kalian sendiri demi allah aku selalu mengharapkan kemuliaan syahadah allah lah yang kelak akan menuntut balas darahku dengan cara yang tidak kalian duga sama sekali
1605596 hei husein bagaimana tuhan akan menuntut balas darahmu dari kami
1605597 allah akan menghukum kalian dengan kejahatan di antara kalian sendiri saat itulah dia akan menurunkan azab nya atas kalian
1605598 ya allah engkau saksikanlah bahwa mereka telah membantai satu satunya cucu nabi mu di muka bumi ini
1605599 aku ingin segera bertemu allah dan rasul nya dalam keadaan seperti ini
1605600 ketika husein terduduk aku menyaksikan sekelompok prajurit kufah datang menyerang dan mengepungnya tiba tiba abdullah bin hasan yang masih sangat belia datang untuk membela pamannya saat bahr bin kaab hendak memukulkan pedangnya ke arah husein abdullah berseru hei anak wanita jalang apa yang hendak kau perbuat terhadap pamanku
1605601 bersabarlah karena sebentar lagi allah akan mempertemukanmu dengan ayah dan kakekmu yang shaleh
1605602 ohhh husein setelahmu dunia ini tak berarti lagi ohhhh andai saja langit ambruk ke bumi ini
1605603 adakah orang muslim di antara kalian lihatlah apa yang mereka perbuat terhadap buah hati rasul
1605604 last year ulster bank enjoyed a hugely successful opening to this partnership with an award winning sponsorship campaign matched by a record breaking box office and we look forward to continued success this year the ulster bank dublin theatre festival will once again be offering an exciting programme of both irish and international talent in what is set to be another great celebration of theatre and performing arts ulster bank shares the ambition of the dublin theatre festival in bringing arts and theatre to as wide an audience as possible and is proud to support a range of key arts programmes throughout the island of ireland
1605605 i am very excited about conducting the family matinee series whose focus this year is how audiences and performers can dance sing and play with music by giving the audience auditory visual and kinesthetic avenues the possibilities for learning fun and enjoyment are unending and the best part about these concerts is that they are completely interactive so dont plan on sitting quietly in your chair i am honored and humbled to stand up in front of the hartford symphony and cant wait to share these concerts with a sold out audience
1605606 ipswich has a proud sporting past and i want to see the beijing olympics and london 2012 act as a springboard for dreams of the future
1605607 in addition to the money ipswich is eligible to receive to make swimming free for those aged 60 and over 25 million has been made available to extend free swimming to those aged 16 or under and i urge ipswich borough council to bid for a share of this funding
1605608 we want to do everything we can to encourage people to do more exercise and help them lead healthier lives
1605609 we are happy to support this initiative to encourage people to go swimming who perhaps would not otherwise do so
1605610 esto es sorprendente dado que los an lisis anteriores de la superficie marciana han sido consistentes pero no concluyentes sobre la presencia de perclorato
1605611 el an lisis inicial sugiere que el suelo se parece al de la tierra pero pruebas adicionales han revelado aspectos en la qu mica del suelo que no se parecen a la superficie de la tierra
1605612 la presencia de perclorato en marte reduce las posibilidades de que sea habitable
1605613 itunes could not update the carrier settings on your iphone an unknown error occurred oxe80000001
1605614 there is going to be from mid afternoon some scattered thundery showers and it is possible the conditions will be right for a few isolated tornados
1605615 but generally in this country tornados are not that big and do not cause that much damage
1605616 there will be wind sheers in the upper atmosphere and that helps to generate the risk of thunder storms and they could create some very gusty winds that might not necessarily be classed as a tornado
1605617 we could see an inch of rain falling as a result of a thunder storm in one place while there could be only a half inch a few miles away these are going to be very localised but the ones that develop could be very heavy suffolk homes
1605618 and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations
1605619 now to the king eternal immortal invisible to god who alone is wise be honor and glory forever and ever amen

1605621 police are following up four enquires from members of the public as a result of the alleged incident all of these people will be spoken to and information will be collected and then we will decide on the next course of action
1605622 he was not very nice i was shocked because i had my daughter there and there were other kids around in the same area
1605623 from our point of view we are aware of an alleged incident if we are asked too we will give 100 cooperation to the police
1605624 we will help the police if requested too but at the moment we have not heard from them if we are contacted by the police we will act accordingly
1605625 we need all shoppers to be alert for these thieves and to call us straight away if you become suspicious of anyone
1605626 this could be someone standing closer to you trying to distract you or just noticing someone who is paying an older shopper particular attention
1605627 if you are suspicious please call officers using 999 we would rather check out the person you are suspicious of than have older residents be targeted in this way
1605628 because of the disruption and concern its caused i expect there has been a number of staff who have voted with their feet and left middle schools to look for jobs in neighbouring counties
1605629 it will have been a contributory factor but its difficult to say for sure without a detailed analysis
1605630 it would be interesting to see how schools in the first phase of reorganisation in lowestoft and haverhill had performed however not all schools in suffolk are middle schools it could be that there has been an impact at junior level as well
1605631 as about half our children at key stage 2 will be in middle schools it would be surprising if there wasnt some effect teachers are very concerned for their own jobs and are discouraged by the lack of support from the county council
1605632 as a response to this suffolk is reorganising schools so that all pupils will be taught within a two tier system
1605633 we are seeing the benefits of some good improvements in the teaching of reading which is encouraging to see
1605634 people get very excited about their causes and lack the sense to see if the information backs them up
1605635 you dont see their bodies going blotchily red and hear them howling like a banshee
1605636 if i lift my kilt on bourbon street im much more likely to get arrested than if elizabeth takes off her top
1605637 during that period we have been looking at all the ways we can of bringing it back to breaking even without affecting fares we decided to change the rates and charges per hour that people use the vehicle
1605638 ive had to make arrangements to get a taxi to pick my mother up and drop her off instead
1605639 the taxi firm will do it for 5 each way so not only is it in line with suffolk acres old prices its actually cheaper
1605640 i appreciate that the price of services is going up but this seems an unreasonable increase
1605641 mum is in a wheelchair and we really need someone there to make sure she gets in and out of the house safely
1605642 we understand that suffolk acres decision is based on a number of factors from fuel prices to increased hourly rates
1605643 however a sudden price increase like this is difficult for people to budget for and it is absolutely vital that people who need to use our services and day care centres like crabbe street still can and are not deterred by the transport costs
1605644 for this reason we have been providing assistance for these customers and we will also be reviewing our customers transports needs to make sure that they can still access the services they need and want to
1605645 were keeping all lines of inquiry open but records have shown that in cases where school fires have been started deliberately a high proportion have been started by ex pupils
1605646 we used the turntable ladder as a kind of water tower the crews worked extremely hard
1605647 the main job was to not make the incident any worse and ensure the safety of firefighters and that no one was injured
1605648 we have asked scenes of crime investigators to visit the scene which is standard practice but a fire of this severity is unusual and we are keeping all options open at this stage
1605649 i have been trying to speak to as many members of staff and the governing body and everyone is saying that the school seems beyond repair on a personal level i am devastated as both my children went to the school there is this sense of immense sadness and loss
1605650 mencari hakikat persepsional dan pengetahuan adalah sesuatu hal di luar batas kemampuan perempuan perempuan seharusnya menelaah bidang bidang keilmuan yang praktis saja kewajiban mereka adalah mengamalkan prinsip prinsip keilmuan yang telah ditemukan oleh laki laki
1605651 kebaikan di tengah kaum perempuan amerika adalah sebuah seni yang hilang mereka berperilaku bagaikan bajingan supaya mirip dengan laki laki
1605652 para sutradara dapat dibagi ke dalam dua kelompok kelompok pertama adalah para sutradara yang ingin merekonstruksi dunia melalui pola pola yang baku kelompok kedua adalah para sutradara yang ingin merekonstruksi dunia agar sesuai dengan impian dan harapannya kelompok kedua ini adalah para penyair dalam dunia sinema
1605653 tujuan saya menulis buku ini bukanlah untuk menyuruh kaum perempuan agar memakai pakaian yang tertutup buku ini cocok untuk perempuan yang tidak bisa memikirkan topik selain masalah kecantikan dirinya tidak diragukan lagi kesadaran diri seorang perempuan adalah alat terbaik bagi perempuan agar ia mampu menentukan apakah mengenakan pakaian yang terbuka dan tidak pantas di hadapan orang asing adalah sesuatu perbuatan yang benar atau tidak
1605654 buku ini memberikan pandangan yang paling jelas dan paling transparan selama tiga generasi terakhir di barat mengenai masalah kesucian perempuan
1605655 wendy shalit menulis sebuah buku untuk kita semua untuk feminis untuk anti feminis cendikiawan dan juga kelompok konservatif menurut kepercayaan shalit dengan menghidupkan kembali hijab tidak saja akan menyadarkan kita dari kelalaian diri selama ini tetapi juga meletakkan pondasi sebuah kehidupan yang sehat dan kokoh kehidupan suami isteri yang bersih dan sehat merupakan sumber kebahagiaan dan kegembiraan yang sama sekali tidak akan pernah bisa dibandingkan kehidupan menyimpang dan penuh kegelapan yang ditimbulkan oleh kehidupan yang tidak berpondasi
1605656 tidakkah merupakan sebuah hal yang aneh ketika kita tidak bisa berbicara mengenai sebuah hal yang sangat penting dan sangat kita perlukan kita terpaksa membicarakan masalah penting itu secara rahasia dan sembunyi sembunyi hijab seorang perempuan adalah salah satu topik yang telah dilarang untuk dibicarakan pada zaman ini dan merupakan salah satu dari pintu pintu yang tertutup yang ditampilkan sebagai hal yang bahaya masalah hijab tidak sekadar menjawab sebuah pertanyaan melainkan merupakan pakaian yang tepat bagi kaum perempuan sehingga topik ini bisa menguncang segalanya
1605657 di kota new york setiap tahunnya lebih dari 54 ribu remaja yang berusia 15 hingga 19 tahun mengandung di masuchusset setiap bulan ditulis lebih dari 4 atau 5 makalah dalam majalah mengenai bagaimana cara untuk melindungi diri dari kekerasan
1605658 pada dekade 90 an penyiksaan terhadap kaum perempuan meningkat tajam dari sisi cara dan tingkat kekerasannya
1605659 saya ingin berkata kepada mereka bahwa menjadi perempuan adalah sebuah kemuliaan dan karena itu tidak perlu berusaha untuk bersikap seperti lelaki setiap orang harus bersikap sebagaimana apa adanya
1605660 kini bukan zamannya lagi untuk memberi nasihat sebaliknya kita harus mengemukakan pertanyaan yang selama ini kita tidak dibenarkan untuk menanyakannya
1605661 apakah hasil dari kebebasan tanpa batas hal hal apa yang harus kita ajarkan kepada anak anak perempuan kita mengapa selepas bertahun tahun pendidikan mengenai apa yang harus dilakukan oleh anak anak lelaki perilaku lelaki dalam masyarakat kita semakin parah mengapa kita harus memerangi hijab dan kesucian
1605662 terdapat dua jenis hijab pertama hijab maknawi yang berupa sikap melindungi harga diri dan memiliki rasa malu hijab jenis kedua adalah pakaian yang menutup tubuh perempuan dengan sempurna seperti jilbab yang digunakan oleh kaum muslimah penelitian dan pengkajian saya lebih banyak saya lakukan pada hijab jenis kedua ini yang pengertiannya banyak sekali disalahartikan bahkan pakar yang menyusun kamus pun tidak memahami dengan benar maksud dari istilah ini mereka sama sekali tidak bertanya mengapa di sepanjang ribuan tahun banyak sekali kaum perempuan yang menutup tubuh mereka dengan hijab
1605663 dewasa ini hijab atau jilbab dipandang memiliki pengertian membelenggu diri sendiri tentu saja pandangan ini tidak benar tidak ada perempuan yang menghendaki diri mereka dibelenggu andai saja perempuan merupakan makhluk yang kurang bijak mungkin saja bisa kita katakan bahwa mereka menutupi diri mereka sepanjang ribuan tahun tanpa alasan tetapi dikarenakan perempuan adalah makhluk yang berakal sebagaimana kaum lelaki dan mereka mempunyai nilai dan kedudukan maka sesungguhnya hijab perempuan memiliki makna yang lebih tinggi menggunakan jilbab bukan berarti tidak memperdulikan lelaki namun bermaksud memberi perhatian kepada sisi insani perempuan dan menyimpan daya tarik alaminya untuk diperlihatkan pada suatu waktu yang tepat dan baik
1605664 malu dan kesucian merupakan sahabat akrab kaum muda dan melindungi mereka ketika melewati usia baligh yang lebih penting dari itu rasa malu dan kesucian memainkan peran penting dalam memilih pasangan hidup
1605665 budaya yang menghormati kesucian perempuan adalah budaya yang menyusun hubungan lelaki dan perempuan dalam bentuk yang halus dan tepat serta sesuai dengan kekhasan masing masing gender
1605666 janganlah kalian menghias rambut memakai pakaian yang tipis dan menampakkan perhiasan kalian sebaliknya hiasilah diri kalian dengan jiwa yang tenteram dan tenang yang bernilai di sisi tuhan
1605667 saya mendengar bahwa sebagian dari perempuan muda menganggap diri mereka sama seperti lelaki dan membiarkan orang lain secara bebas menjalin hubungan dengan mereka janganlah kalian membuang waktu kalian dengan perilaku yang rendah ini dan jangan lupakan jati diri kalian
1605668 kami adalah manusia kami juga memiliki perasaan dan jatidiri insani kami bukanlah komputer yang hanya mengikuti aturan aturan yang kering dan tiran perempuan memiliki potensi lebih dari itu yaitu potensi untuk sampai ke tingkat yang lebih tinggi pakaian dan kesucian perempuan mengisi kekosongan dalam jawaban atas pertanyaan bagaimana untuk menjadi perempuan dan apa arti kecantikan bagi perempuan
1605669 undang undang larangan berjilbab ditetapkan untuk menghalangi meluasnya pengaruh islam di perancis anak muda muslim di eropa kini menyambut jilbab dengan lebih baik dibandingkan dari waktu waktu yang lampau dan hal ini menimbulkan ketakutan pada masyarakat eropa
1605670 perancis adalah sebuah negara yang harus menghormati kebebasan individu jilbab merupakan sebuah pilihan pribadi dan setiap orang harus memiliki kebebasan dalam membuat keputusan pengesahan undang undang larangan berjilbab di perancis membuktikan adanya masalah yang lebih penting dan lebih dalam dari sekedar penggunaan jilbab yaitu ketakutan mereka terhadap infiltrasi budaya islam
1605671 anak saya pergi ke sekolah dengan menggunakan jilbab karena itulah yang diperintahkan oleh tuhan oleh karena itu tidak ada undang undang yang bisa menolak pakaian ini dan kami akan tetap melaksanakan aturan tuhan ini
1605672 sebenarnya islamlah yang menjadikan sasaran dalam pengesahan undang undang larangan berjilbab ini islam selama ini telah diperkenalkan sebagai musuh barat namun kini perkembangan islam di barat malah semakin meluas karena islam merupakan agama yang komprehensif dan mampu menjawab berbagai persoalan kehidupan perkembangan islam inilah yang membuat pemerintah barat ketakutan
1605673 secara pribadi saya menyokong penuh pengesahan undang undang yang melarang penggunaan simbol agama apapun di sekolah sekolah para imigran perancis haruslah secara menerima undang undang republik ini dan kebijakan sekularismenya secara mutlak
1605674 perintah al quran untuk menjaga kemuliaan dan pakaian ditujukan baik kepada lelaki maupun perempuan perintah ini sangat jelas tercantum dalam al quran dimana perempuan mukmin tidak dibenarkan untuk memperlihatkan perhiasannya kecuali beberapa bagian tertentu sementara itu kaum laki laki yang beriman juga diperintahkan untuk menahan pandangannya dan memelihara dirinya jilbab merupakan semacam pelindung bagi kaum perempuan untuk menjaga harga dirinya sendiri dan harga diri keluarganya
1605675 al quran juga menyatakan bahwa wanita tidak perlu senantiasa berjilbab mereka boleh tidak berjilbab ketika bersama suami ayah ayah mereka putera putera dan saudara lelaki putera putera saudara lelaki atau saudara perempuan mereka dan juga di depan anak anak lelaki yang belum baligh
1605676 penggunaan jilbab bagi wanita muslimah merupakan sebuah nilai dan sebuah pilihan yang murni
1605677 keterbatasan jilbab merupakan nilai yang lebih tinggi dari kebebasan biasa manusia karena pakaian agama merupakan kunci kebebasan dari penjara hawa nafsu bagi perempuan dan masyarakat hari ini saya memahami bahwa jilbab merupakan pelindung perempuan jilbab menghalangi penjualan harga diri dan menghalangi diri dari tatapan atau perhatian orang asing kenyataannya jilbab yang tidak memperdagangkan fisik perempuan merupakan perhiasan nilai bagi jiwa dan kemanusiaan seseorang karena itu jilbab sesungguhnya adalah pakaian yang mulia dan terpuji
1605678 manusia moderen barat telah lelah dengan materialisme dan mereka mencari perlindungan di bawah naungan agama ketertarikan mereka kepada islam merupakan suatu harapan yang manis buat mereka selepas peristiwa 11 september propaganda anti islam di barat justru meninggalkan dampak yang bertolak belakang para pemuda kristen malah cenderung dan tertarik kepada agama islam hal ini dibuktikan dengan fakta bahwa selepas peristiwa ini quran menjadi sebuah buku yang paling laris terjual di barat kini banyak wanita barat yang berjilbab dan kami menilai hal ini sebagai sebuah hal yang positif
1605679 sebagian dari analis sekular sangat gencar memperkenalkan agama sebagai kendala bagi kemajuan dan kebebasan umat islam dan kristen sesungguhnya mampu mewujudkan keadilan solidaritas dan perdamaian di antara bangsa bangsa saya sebagai seorang pemeluk kristen percaya bahwa dikarenakan nilai nilai akhlaknya yang istimewa umat islam harus diberikan kebebasan agama dan harus diberi tempat yang layak dalam kehidupan sosial perancis
1605680 jilbab merupakan sarana untuk melindungi perempuan dalam berhadapan dengan para pengejar nafsu yang ingin menjadikan perempuan sebagai barang konsumsi pakaian islam ini dihiasi dengan nilai nilai spiritual dan kemanusiaan oleh karena itu pakaian ini amatlah baik bagi perempuan
1605681 pakaian yang sesuai tidak akan menghalangi aktivitas dan pekerjaan wanita dalam masyarakat sebagaimana yang kita lihat kaum perempuan iran yang berjilbab mampu membesarkan anak anak yang sehat bekerja di berbagai bidang bahkan aktif di politik mereka tidak saja memelihara kemuliaan diri sendiri melainkan menjaga kemuliaan masyarakatnya dengan berjilbab mereka hadir dalam semua lapangan sosial dan politik dengan sukses
1605682 masalah pelanggaran hak di jerman menyebabkan muslimah kurang sekali mendapat pekerjaan dan terpaksa berhenti dari sekolah pelarangan mengenakan kerudung merupakan sebuah diskriminasi dan penetapan batas dalam urusan ini merupakan satu kesalahan pelarangan kerudung telah mengancam kebebasan wanita dan hal ini hanya akan memperumit masalah
1605683 dalam sebuah masyarakat yang menerima homosexual secara resmi atas alasan kebebasan mengapa justru menghalangi orang orang yang beriman dan ingin mengamalkan keimanan mereka itu pejabat legislatif jerman harus melakukan perubahan mendasar untuk menghalangi terjadinya perilaku diskriminatif ini
1605684 mengapa orang orang yang berkuasa tidak bisa menerima beberapa anak perempuan yang mengenakan kerudung karena kepercayaan bahwa hal itu diwajibkan dalam ajaran agama mereka bukankah kerudung tersebut sama saja dengan syal atau selendang yang dipakai oleh anak anak perempuan lain
1605685 perbedaan khusus fisik dan jiwa perempuan dan lelaki adalah satu fakta yang tidak dapat ditolak mewujudkan persamaan hak tanpa memperdulikan karakteristik tersebut merupakan suatu hal yang bertentangan dengan hukum penciptaan tuhan dan menyimpang dari keadilan di pihak lain apakah negara yang mengesahkan undang undang persamaan di seluruh bidang bagi perempuan dan lelaki bisa menghindarkan berbagai kekerasan terhadap perempuan
1605686 kebudayaan yang mendominasi isi konvensi itu memposisikan perempuan dan lelaki secara saling berhadapan bukan saling berdampingan dalam kebudayaan seperti ini lelaki dan perempuan berada dalam dua medan yang berbeda dan menjadi rival satu sama lain perempuan diharuskan bekerja untuk meraih kekuatan materi agar mencapai posisi yang lebih tinggi dari lelaki konvensi ini tidak memberikan tempat bagi konsep kesamaan hati kerjasama dan saling membangun antara laki laki dan perempuan di dalam wadah keluarga
1605687 pelayanan terhadap nafsu seksual yang akan menjamin terpeliharanya kebebasan berpikir
1605688 kebebasan mendasar dalam bidang politik ekonomi sosial kebudayaan sipil dan bidang bidang lainnya dimiliki oleh perempuan tanpa dibatasi oleh ikatan perkawinan dan berlandaskan kepada persamaan mutlak antara perempuan dan lelaki
1605689 konvensi pbb adalah sarana untuk memperluas imperialisme dan tujuan utamanya adalah untuk mewujudkan kebudayaan global yang bersumber dari amerika adalah jelas bahwa kondisi perempuan tidak sama di semua negara dalam masyarakat islam perempuan tidak dieksploitasi sebagaimana yang terjadi di barat masalah utama dalam hal ini sesungguhnya adalah adanya pandangan rendah terhadap perempuan dalam kebudayaan dan adat istiadat sebuah masyarakat
1605690 lelaki dan diberi hak yang sama di hadapan undang undang dalam hal kebebasan pulang pergi secara individu dan kebebasan memilih rumah serta tempat tinggal
1605691 serangan terhadap peran ibu agama dan kedaulatan bangsa sekali lagi mengancam kita jika kita memperhatikan dokumen pbb akan terlihat bahwa kondisi pbb saat ini sudah berubah dari waktu waktu yang lampau hal ini bisa kita lihat dalam konvensi yang telah menyerang peran kaum ibu agama dan kedaulatan bangsa dan juga bisa dilihat dalam haluan kerja pbb yang mulai berubah konvensi mengklaim bahwa sebelum kita meratifikasinya kita boleh melakukan penilaian terhadapnya dalam menghadapi poin poin yang menyerang posisi keibuan agama dan kepentingan nasional kita tetapi dalam pasal ke 28 konvensi itu dengan jelas sekali menyatakan bahwa segala bentuk penilaian atau perubahan yang tidak sesuai dengan tujuan konvensi tidak akan diterima
1605692 menurut pandangan saya hijab memberikan kekuatan yang menakjubkan kepada wanita seolah olah ia adalah tanda yang memberi peringatan kepada orang lain bahwa saya tidak ingin menjadi fokus pandangan
1605693 hari ini saya mengetahui bahwa hijab merupakan pelindung bagi kaum perempuan dalam realitanya hijab islam yang tidak memperlihatkan bentuk tubuh manusia telah menunjukkan nilai nilai spiritual dan insani seseorang dan ini adalah suatu yang amat indah
1605694 wanita dalam masyarakat barat terpaksa bersaing dengan wanita wanita lain untuk menarik perhatian suami mereka dan berupaya untuk tidak memiliki kekurangan apapun dari yang lain wanita barat senantiasa merasa khawatir suami mereka akan dirampas oleh wanita lain berkembangnya kebebasan tanpa batas di barat membuat satu dari dua keluarga memiliki hubungan seks tak sah jika melihat dengan teliti kita akan dapat membuat kesimpulan bahwa wanitalah yang selalunya dirugikan dan inilah yang mereka sebut dengan persamaan hak perempuan dan pria
1605695 bila jilbab itu wajib dipakai perempuan dampaknya akan besar implikasinya perempuan tidak bisa melakukan apa apa sebagai manusia yang diciptakan allah karena serba manusia
1605696 seperti yang dikemukakan fatima mernisi dalam buku wanita dalam islam dalam masa masa awal kehidupan islam ruang yang diciptakan nabi sepertinya tidak ada dikotomi antara ruang privat nabi dan isteri isterinya dengan kaum muslimin lainnya qs 33 53 menegaskan akan ruang privat nabi dan isteri isterinya yang berarti diduga sebelumnya tidak dikotomi publik dan privat
1605697 lho maksudnya bukan membedakan antara budak dengan merdeka toh ayat itu sama sekali tidak menyebut kata budak berarti sah sah saja dong saya memberikan kemungkinan penafsiran yang lain tapi membedakan antara yang muslim dengan yang bukan muslim
1605698 hai nabi katakanlah kepada istrimu anak anakmu dan istri istri orang mukmin hendaklah mereka menutupkan kain kerudung ke dadanya yang demikian itu supaya mereka mudah dikenal dan tidakdiganggu dan sesungguhnya allah maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang
1605699 lho yang disuruh berkata bahwa tidak ada tuhan selain allah itu cuma nabi kok bukan kita
1605700 yang jadi masalah manakah yang kita akui sebagai syariat mana yang bukan mana yang benar benar diturunkan tuhan mana yang di institutionalized oleh sebagian ulama picik
1605701 wahai abu thalib kelak kemenakanmu ini akan diangkat menjadi nabi dialah nabi yang dinanti nantikan kedatangannya karena itu bawalah dia kembali ke mekah dan jangan biarkan kaum yahudi di negeri syam menyakitinya
1605702 wahai sekalian suku quresy jika akan katakan bahwa di belakang bukit ini ada pasukan musuh yang datang menyerang apakah kalian akan mempercayai kata kataku
1605703 jika demikian ketahuilah bahwa aku membawa risalah dan ajaran dari tuhan untuk kalian semua
1605704 ya allah ampunilah kaumnya karena mereka tidak mengetahui kebenaran yang aku bawa
1605705 demi allah rasul allah saaw telah mengambil keputusan dimana tak ada satu pun dari kami yang dapat memintanya untuk mengubah keputusan tersebut
1605706 ya allah cabutlah penglihatan orang orang qureisy sehingga mereka tidak akan melihat kedatanganku kecuali dalam keadaan tiba tiba dan tidak mendengar rencanaku ini kecuali mendadak
1605707 belum tibakah saatnya bagimu untuk meyakini bahwa tidak ada tuhan selain allah
1605708 sesungguhnyalah wahai muhammad betapa lembutnya hatimu betapa mulianya dirimu dan betapa besarnya perhatianmu terhadap pertalian keluarga demi allah aku telah menyangka bahwa jika ada tuhan lain selain nya maka aku tidak akan memerlukannya
1605709 belum tibakah saatnya bagimu untuk meyakini bahwa aku adalah utusan allah
1605710 demi allah tentang yang satu ini di hati masih ada ganjalan
1605711 menyerahlah dan bersaksilah bahwa tiada tuhan selain allah dan muhammad utusan allah sebelum lehermu dipenggal
1605712 benar benar hebat mereka itu demi allah kerajaan keponakanmu telah sedemikian besar dan kuat
1605713 celaka kau hei abu sufyan ini bukan kerajaan akan tetapi kenabian
1605714 segala puji bagi allah yang telah menepati janji nya dan menolong hamba nya dan mengalahkan golongan golongan kuffar musyrikin sendirian
1605715 kami mengatakan yang baik dan berpendapat dengan pendapat yang baik pula engkau adalah saudara kami yang mulia dan anak saudara kami yang mulia dan engkau telah mencapai kemenangan
1605716 sedangkan aku mengatakan kepada kalian sebagaimana yang dikatakan oleh saudaraku yusuf
1605717 kalian adalah seburuk buruk tetangga nabi kalian telah mendustakan mengusir dan mengganggu tetapi kalianbelum puas dengan semua itu lalu kalian memerangiku pula pergilah kalian dankalian adalah orang orang yang dimerdekakan
1605718 wahai bani hasyim wahai bani abdul muttalib sesungguhnya aku adalah utusan allah kepada kalian dan aku sangat mengasihi kalian
1605719 allah telah menolong kalian dalam banyak medan pertempuran dan dalam perang hunain ketika kalian merasa bangga dengan jumah kalian yang besar tetapi hal itu tidak berguna apa pun bagi kalian dan bumi pun menjadi sempit bagi kalian padahal ia luas kemudian kalian melarikan diri dari medan perang
1605720 orang orang tertinggal di belakang dan tidak ikut berperang itu merasa gembira dengan ketertinggalan mereka di belakang rasulullah
1605721 jangan kalian berangkat perang dalam udara panas begini katakanlah kepada mereka itu api neraka lebih panas lagi jika saja kalian mengerti biarlah nanti mereka tertawa sedikit dan menangis lebih banyak sebagai balasan atas hasil perbuatan mereka
1605722 ada pula di antara mereka yang berkata ijinkanlah saya tidak ikut serta dan jangan kau jerumuskan saya ke dalam fitnah ini ketahuilah mereka kini sudah terjatuh ke dalam ujian itu dan bahwa neraka itu adalah tempat bagi orang orang kafir
1605723 barang siapa yang menjadikan aku sebagai pemimpinnya maka ali adalah pemimpinnya pula

1605973 the case for democracy the power of freedom to overcome tyranny and terror
1605974 let me say that at the time of the last election i made a mistake in the way the issue was handled
1605975 but can i also say that since the last election water has become the most important issue for australia indeed many parts of the world
1605976 wa unlike other states has the capacity to develop an integrated water supply system to provide water security for this state for another 100 years
1605977 a long term well thought out well costed and considered project
1605978 its time in wa for some genuine big thinking some big thinking some forward thinking because this generation right now is in a unique period of prosperity that weve enjoyed in recent years
1605979 there is a responsibility on this generation to provide for future generations this is the time to do it and water is one of the key issues
1605980 probably been too much too quickly for people to absorb
1605981 in wa we happen to have one of the worlds greatest water resources and we should use that for the state
1605982 in the last 50 years the pilbara has underpinned our development in the mining and resources industries in the next 50 years the kimberley will be just as important
1605983 you have to be consistent with him you have to use a reward chart
1605984 do you know how lucky you are to have a family who loves you
1605985 we were hoping mr b could help with the field trip but you know if hanging around with kids isnt his thing thats okaaaaay
1605986 in fifteen years we have never encountered a child like this
1605987 we cant have provincial unions and teams playing in a competition and not being able to afford to do so
1605988 were not prepared obviously at this stage to talk about individual teams the two teams that are going
1605989 but obviously there is some difficulty between nelson and marlborough which is best sorted out by those people

1605996 execution by shooting wont kill the convicts instantly the law states that if the first shot on the heart doesnt work they must be shot again to the head he said
1605997 the executions are one problem and the decision of the constitutional court is another problem there is no relationship human rights minister andi mattalatta said
1605998 it has nothing to do with the execution process the constitutional challenge they filed wont have any effect on the planned execution he said
1605999 it will only have an effect if the constitutional court issues a decision quickly in their favour

1606009 dithering and decide who will build its high speed broadband network saying repeated delays are costing the country up to 350 million a month
1606010 by this continued delay and dithering about making a decision on the national broadband plan were sacrificing 200 to 350 million a month dr burgess said
1606011 we ought to be out there digging holes laying cable connecting people
1606012 the biggest pair of policy bums the country has ever had
1606013 not made one valuable structural change in the 12 years he was treasurer
1606014 hes a guy without imagination and he is a guy without courage that point was proven by the fact he let former prime minister howard stay there for so long
1606015 its a liberal party so bereft of talent that they have to go to such a low grade performer as costello to come back as their leader
1606016 in national terms to have such a nong and he is in policy terms he is a mouse to have him back again speaks volumes about the liberal party
1606017 in labor party terms i sort of hope he does as he makes it a better pitch for us
1606018 peter costello stated his intentions at the end of last year and if he seeks to change those intentions hes entitled to do so but he can do so in his own time
1606019 as far as im aware his intentions are precisely as he stated them at the end of last year
1606020 it is impossible now to look after the baby boomers impossible
1606021 it was the labor government of australia that broke the back of inflation in the recession in the early 90s
1606022 in 1993 there was no risk to inflation at all but the bank gun shy shoved on the brakes and only released them after the howard government had been elected

1606024 but as with many things in life there are people who seek to take advantage of these systems and are now committing crimes on the internet that are affecting each and every one of us in different ways
1606025 the internet provides an opportunity for criminals to commit crimes undetected with a level of anonymity that previously they would not have had available to them
1606026 we really have to think about what we have online and how were protecting it
1606027 cyber criminals are becoming quite skilled in planning and executing their attacks
1606028 there is no doubt that technology has the ability to increase economic growth

1606036 a dead animals dna does not guarantee the offspring will be identical to the deceased it takes more than just genes to create an animal
1606037 we dont need new sources to compete with animal shelters and reputable breeders
1606038 the cells status was indeed bad as they had been stored for a long time
1606039 but the scientific technology has also developed compared with when we cloned snuppy there is no room for any doubt over whether they are real clones

1606042 my wife was so brave she was low down and reached up for the pistol she handed it to me and i just fired at them
1606043 the two men their faces covered by bandannas burst into the shop waving machetes one of them though came off second best after being shot in the face with one of these air pistols
1606044 he complied with the bandits requests but still they shot him and he was dead
1606045 not only did they do the right thing theyve set a benchmark dont take crap
1606046 what is different about this country that we cant allow our decent citizens to have some form of retaliatory against this kind of attack
1606047 other shop owners and people should learn to defend themselves should learn how to defend ourselves and our family and our property from now on because the government have failed

1606061 ive been to the most haunted place in britain and it was nothing compared to the flat
1606062 its been going on for years and its terrifying really but because we go up all the time weve sort of got used to it
1606063 no one seemed to be responsible the hotel didnt do anything at all
1606064 i want to know what the hotel are going to do about it
1606065 theyve not got cctv theyre not taking responsibility and havent even given us an apology
1606066 this is the first such incident to take place at the hotel which has an excellent security record and an immediate review of security was undertaken to minimise the possibility of any similar incidents occurring in the future
1606067 this is the first time ive broken a bone in my life im truly sorry for not being able to show you my magnificent dancing laugh
1606068 with sho kun to suddenly have a fracture like this he must be getting really fatigued and worn out by it right johnnys is making him work too much

1606071 soon they will reach an age where it will not be appropriate to overdo things
1606072 in one way or another everyone of us has been shaped by the stories we have read and absorbed in the past all stories including fairy tales can sometimes permeate your inner life and become part of you

1606075 hi i need someone to fix my whoozits do you fix whoozitses
1606076 okay my whoozits is blue do you fix the blue ones
1606077 hi i called two weeks ago id like to bring my car in today to get the whoozits fixed
1606078 today no we cant get you in today were booked solid through 3014 also we do whoozitses but only if they are red and accompanied by a mark of death without that we cant do it
1606079 what about the guy i talked to two weeks ago who said that you would fix my blue whoozits anytime
1606080 well maam i dont know who you talked to but we dont do that
1606081 in 1999 parliament specifically voted against dairies having the ability to sell wine and beer as well
1606082 this has been circumvented to a large extent by convenience stores that are dairies by another name
1606083 the bill makes it unlawful to supply alcohol to a minor without the permission of the minors parent or guardian
1606084 this is the closest that new zealand will have come to having a drinking age
1606085 dey should not be pwaying dat song because dey are not the beach boys
1606086 had wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1606087 excited its been a long year for me so its good to get back and play my first game
1606088 he got a clearance a couple of weeks ago but we didnt want to push it too early
1606089 cleared every hurdle its time for him to get out there now and test it in the real stuff
1606090 it was just frustrating aye when things happen and you dont want them to and you cant do anything about it so wasnt the best sitting down there
1606091 no doubt i will be a bit rusty i havent played for like a year im confident ive put all the hard work in
1606092 the only real disappointment ive got is i wont be able to play 80 minutes
1606093 i feel that he drake can be a very good tight end he and bogue need to show consistency in technique but they possess significant talent to shore up that position
1606094 you can buy our tires but you cannot run any other brand car on it
1606095 it tying is often illegal when the products are not naturally related
1606096 im coaching the football team the football team has moved forward the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
1606097 and you can talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else and we talked about that as a football team were a good football team and we have an excellent opportunity to be a very good football team in 2008 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible
1606098 well at least ive never done that so im better than him
1606099 true or not true i still support riida and arashi more than ever
1606100 arashis ohno satoshi got drunk and played around with some girls in a karaoke booth
1606101 that and we got so many emails we got a lot of emails from foreign and overseas people oddly
1606102 if they could make people happy in this way or have fans who cared this much about them
1606103 you do have those kinds of fans you fools i hope you realize how much the fans care about you because its really amazing all around the world people love you dearly
1606104 it was odd to see a bmw dealership in a communist country it was definitely for the tourists
1606105 those people need a wetsuit wimps i am so hardcore i dont need no stinkin wetsuit
1606106 well it took her an hour and 7 minutes to catch me after i prolly left her in my waves in the swim yeah i showed her
1606107 oh make all the noise you want because i am
1606108 ok i am gonna kinda need to catch up with her
1606109 you go girl beat our husbands you have to beat them
1606110 i just couldnt get cha i tried but i just couldnt do it
1606111 i knew you were back there you passed me in the bike i knew you were there thanks for the awesome competition
1606112 do unto others what you would like others do unto you
1606113 my feeling is that my role in the presidential election this time is to remain thoroughly as one of the coordinators i wont say any more in detail but i firmly believe that a presidential election involving more than one candidate will be held
1606114 there was a dumplings food poisoning case that took place in china in mid june
1606115 the chinese government places great importance on the incident the public security authorities are currently investigating with their utmost effort
1606116 as soon as he saw there was no foundation that nothing had been done at all he started vomiting
1606117 sometimes the people from the church used to disagree but now they dont say anything
1606118 we are going to redeploy troops of the two parties from where they are now stationed and will leave cambodian buddhist monks and clergywomen in the pagoda
1606119 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1606120 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1606121 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1606122 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1606123 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1606124 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1606125 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1606126 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1606127 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1606128 everything went kind of sour a few weeks or a month back but you never felt like it would get to the point or to the talks of him actually being traded
1606129 i felt once he stepped back in here he would be the quarterback him not being here today i guess management has a different route so at that point weve got to go out and do our job
1606130 i have no doubts that when i line up next week on the start line i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean
1606131 ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar
1606132 that is not sport its plain cheating and we need to be vigilant in nailing those who cross the line
1606133 we agree with tamsyn that its a problem but its a problem that the ioc international olympic committee is throwing enormous efforts at to solve
1606134 i think the best attitude for athletes here is to concentrate on their performances and leave the detection of cheats to the appropriate authorities
1606135 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1606136 unless something really weird happens i dont see the fed moving before the november election
1606137 the fed doesnt like to be in the spotlight during the heat of a presidential campaign
1606138 i think they will prefer waiting now until they can get a better view of how the economy is unfolding and see if financial markets become less fragile
1606139 weve done this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights record on tibet
1606140 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1606141 its absolutely critical that a message is sent to the chinese government to meaningfully address and end violence and repression in tibet or they will never be truly accepted by the international community
1606142 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1606143 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1606144 a close race down to the wire only one winner thanks i accept
1606145 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
1606146 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place
1606147 raise whatever he needs for his defense as any mother in this room would do
1606148 the disappointment i have is knowing theyll never be able to get those boys out
1606149 i see those bodies in that black hole totally covered in coal
1606150 fire us all it wasnt just me it was fire us all and get more players if we couldnt get it in that book the way he wanted it
1606151 my husband is a coal miner my dads a coal miner my brothers a coal miner
1606152 it does carry a why theyre paid so well but the coal mines actually are pretty safe i think what happened at crandall murray got a little greedy and was robbing coal where he shouldnt have been taking it out
1606153 his ideas remain alive he is the father or the brother of all political prisoners
1606154 we will read and listen to him for a long time to come every one of his words is steeped in his own blood
1606155 he was one of our strongest personalities a unique person
1606156 i think its such a politically charged topic what do you do with these exotic animals
1606157 theres never been any problem with them mistreating the animals or problems with the enclosures
1606158 if theres going to be more regulations put someone on the job who knows what theyre doing
1606159 allowing it to enter the enjoining enclosure and kill an adult female tiger
1606160 we feel better at least there is someone around that you can trust and knows how to help you
1606161 if you look around and see the soldiers you automatically feel safer
1606162 i believe we are on the right track to guarantee more safety for citizens to give them the feeling that the state is there and it is serious about fighting crime
1606163 the soldiers make you feel safer but its sad that we need them
1606164 i think it is a good measure as long as it is temporary
1606165 if it lasted longer it would give me a sense of militarization
1606166 no one is afraid of the military but to use them in cities is a media move to cover up the cuts to security forces

1606199 the announcement by minister harney is good news it means ireland is catching up with the 10 other eu countries along with canada the us australia and new zealand who have implemented a similar programme

1606206 the new images and additional information provided by familysearch will significantly enhance and improve the overall english and welsh census collection and its addition to familysearch org will increase awareness of the rich web resources of familysearch affiliates and the likelihood of success for familysearch org patrons doing british research
1606207 findmypast com is delighted to be working with familysearch to launch the british census collection online censuses are the core building blocks for family historians and genealogists alike and now at last here is the definitive version this has been a very exciting project for us and we look forward to collaborating with familysearch in the future to bring other important collections to an ever wider international audience
1606208 the familysearch england and wales census project is clearly a milestone initiative in the history of genealogical research it heralds a new era of easier accessibility to a mountain literally of genealogical material available hitherto only to the privileged few if at all we are delighted to be working with familysearch and proud that they have chosen for the familysearch website the 1841 and 1871 uk censuses the most accurate available which the origins network and iim jointly developed
1606209 this is a powerful addition for people exploring their genealogy through genetics
1606210 researching a paternal line with y dna enables a person to go deep into their ancestry beyond traditional research roadblocks such as missing documentation also it can help them understand how a living person with the same last name is related to them
1606211 as projects are completed images will be available for free in nara reading rooms and familysearchs 4 500 family history centers
1606212 i wonder how people that have donated their time for the indexing are going to feel about their work going to a commercial company
1606213 the 1891 census of canada is a vital resource for casual and avid family history enthusiasts alike as it provides a detailed snapshot into a specific time in canadas history
1606214 this census successfully measured the majority of canadas population at this time and so is a rich source of important information about individuals their families and the society in which they lived
1606215 the generations network inc acquired the online rights to the 1891 census of canada from the library and archives of canada lac in ottawa ontario
1606216 census records are among the most important documents the american people have to trace their genealogy and know their family history having two of our partners working together to enhance the indexes and images of these essential documents will enable an unprecedented level of access and understanding
1606217 this collaboration represents a significant step forward in making family history research more accessible the enhanced u s federal census collection that will become available through this agreement is a gold mine for family history researchers and we look forward to collaborating with familysearch in identifying other opportunities to help people discover their roots
1606218 the u s censuses are arguably the most important collection of u s genealogical records familysearch is excited to see the complete improved indexes of these collections freely available online over the next two years and we look forward to working with ancestry com to enhance access to additional significant collections in the future
1606219 as projects are completed images will be available for free in nara reading rooms and familysearchs 4 500 family history centers
1606220 we had talked to cathy and when she let us know that she was interested in coming back
1606221 she thought she and tiffany smith would do a good job together they just thought with the two of them that they could better serve our players together
1606222 were excited to have these two step forward and take over the team were looking forward to a good year
1606223 for me its just a great opportunity to bring cathy back with all the playing and coaching experience she has
1606224 to get that kind of experience between the two of them and also that winning tradition you just cant ask for much more
1606225 im just excited for the opportunity to learn from her applegate

1606231 if you leave us a bequest well put it with wayne county community foundation that just lends us tremendous credibility
1606232 we wanted to invest in wayne county rather than in some investment firm out of the area part of the reason we were willing to do so is the foundation had made such large growth
1606233 we all have one thing in common we feel very strongly about our community
1606234 we needed to make a couple plays and it was right there for us we tell our kids you have to want to be that guy in the clutch and they all want the ball hit to them with the game on the line you just have to make those plays were encouraged by the way they played but were just frustrated for the kids because of how this finished
1606235 he pitched tonight and he threw against kentucky he went into that game and thought he had to try to beat them by himself its a sign of growth in luke that he did the things he was able to do today
1606236 we took a crushing loss and came back the way we did today and played great for six innings
1606237 the mood was great in the dugout and the kids came ready to play
1606238 we just talked about the last five weeks and what weve been through together
1606239 the little things are important in this game and you have to do them to beat good teams were a good team we just didnt make the plays to beat good teams the kids know what they need to work on

1606246 ive got a lot of confidence ive always had a lot of confidence
1606247 your will to win will win out in the end
1606248 youve lost some depth rich thats all last year i went without two of my top five players every game you can beat this your talent level is still high
1606249 demand their best effort because thats what they deserve refuse their impulse to sulk and blame fill them with a desire to win in spite of the ghosts
1606250 let me leave you with one thing i know there are no excuses to be had only victories to be won

1606256 to involve innocent parties the states workers who have to pay for their mortgage payments who have to pay for their tanks of gas who have to pay for their kids going back to school i dont think we should bring them into this political fight

1606260 we posted a lot of jobs everywhere and of the three people i hired somebody from webguild we posted our job on the webguild job posting and that was one of the only ones that i actually got a resume that i thought was interesting
1606261 im here to shop the summer sales at charlotte russe i wont be buying fall clothes until september

1606267 when i opened this store four years ago i had no concept if it would succeed or if it would fail but i wanted to make sure the store did some good
1606268 i thought i need to be an ambassador for these girls nobody was there for them
1606269 our girls have been dependent on their parents and then dependent on their husbands this guarantees that in the future these girls would be independent people
1606270 most girls are the first in their family to finish elementary school
1606271 its a theme other organizations have found educate women and improve lives
1606272 doing this has just made me much more aware that id like to spend the rest of my life being of service
1606273 she knew every detail of my best friends life and it was very touching the level of connection she felt with her sponsor 10 000 miles away
1606274 obama said a couple of days ago says we all should inflate our tires i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
1606275 i plan my wednesdays so i dont have to work in the afternoons
1606276 wednesday night is my night out thursday night im packing and friday im at the shore we get here early and just drink water until the drink specials start
1606277 wednesday is the night for people who feel the nightspots dont belong to them on fridays and saturdays
1606278 when i go out on wednesday nights i see people that i know people that im friends with
1606279 its a nice way to get out and reconnect with people
1606280 we are on all the time but at the same time the social barriers are crumbling
1606281 historically weve promoted wednesday night as a late shopping night in philadelphia
1606282 but now its the most exciting night of the week
1606283 in cities like new york miami and chicago the weekends are for amateurs
1606284 one morning when the snow was particularly bad i remember pedaling and the bike barely moving
1606285 pedestrians passing me by raised eyebrows and all but i was too stubborn to suck it up and cab it
1606286 but for women there are all those other layers that are implicitly expected hair makeup general put togetherness all of which get thrown off by a windy sweaty or rainy bike ride into the office
1606287 our public transportation leaves much to be desired taxis are increasingly more expensive driving is costly with gas and parking
1606288 we have definitely seen more new cyclists getting started this season
1606289 usually i wear bright colors because it sometimes feels like the cars on the road are trying to kill you
1606290 looking through a box of dishes that my dad left me i found a stack of old postcards that ive never seen i cant figure out why ive never looked through this box before
1606291 anyway most of the postcards are old california tourist stuff but one caught my eye because i recognized my dad as a young man sitting with his father
1606292 it is the exact same one that now sits in my living room
1606293 i knew the loveseat i have belonged to my grandfathers mother who died in 1915 and i suspected the original wood was a dark cherry my grandmother had it antiqued in the 1960s oh if only it were a color picture so i could tell what the fabric looked like
1606294 one of the worlds largest and most accessible genealogical libraries
1606295 as a clergy person i teach any number of bible theology classes in which i have to read deeply in order to prepare to teach i learned long ago a long time before the net that i cant do that kind of in depth reading without underlining highlighting and taking notes none of which i can do on a computer screen
1606296 look at the number of people putting trees on the social genealogy sites and wonder how few of them have ever stepped foot into a major genealogy library
1606297 but the exchange of data through interaction with a librarian is of great value
1606298 where is the collection going and how soon will it be accessible again
1606299 grant giving tours lectures and other means of encouraging genealogical research
1606300 combining the two collections will result in an extraordinary resource for people nationwide seeking to learn about family members who were born in new york lived in new york or passed through new york on the way to becoming citizens
1606301 the g amp b collections great strength lies in its holdings for the 17th to 18th centuries with emphasis on the dutch and english the nypl genealogical collections are strongest for the 19th to 20th centuries and embrace many different ethnic groups
1606302 new york is the historic center of u s immigration together two venerable new york institutions will create one of the worlds largest and most accessible genealogical libraries as a result of this contribution the wealth of genealogical resources in the g amp bs unique collection integrated with the nypls incomparable holdings will within two years be fully accessible to anyone conducting research in this area
1606303 once we decided to sell our building and move the library to a new location stewardship and accessibility became the most important words in our vocabulary
1606304 we sought the strongest possible partner an organization that would value the g amp b collection highly because it significantly complements its own and that would make the g amp b library broadly available to researchers worldwide equally important it had to have the professional staff and resources to appropriately house catalogue and properly conserve the collection the nypl has precisely those resources and a collection that fits extremely well with ours
1606305 this series represents some of the most important research we have ever published
1606306 the earliest history of our country started with these pioneers and this compendia offers information on them that is available no where else
1606307 i have one message for these hoodlums these troops know how to shoot and kill and they are more than willing to do so if necessary
1606308 do you know what kind of people we have coming here
1606309 thats all the respect youre going to get especially when you win by one point you can look for that and you could end up not in the same place you were the year before
1606310 were not focused on anybody respecting us sometimes in this sport we can go out and take it we showed that last year it was a great accomplishment and were proud of it and its behind us
1606311 twenty five years ago we didnt have anybody good enough to wrestle and compete at the olympic games
1606312 now weve got world medalists coming back and guys that are hungry guys that have confidence behind them
1606313 if you look at it from public finance weve put 500 million pounds into elite sports public investment needs a return if we came well short of that 41 medal haul wed be very concerned it wasnt a target that we put to uk sport uk sport themselves decided thats what we should expect we will have a review looking at those sports that have been successful and those that havent

1606344 we certainly believe that whatever we do in exile will lead to policy changes inside tibet and with that support from the international community and media we hope to utilize all this for our freedom struggle
1606345 all tibetans not only in india and in the motherland of china they just enjoy full freedom all the talks between the central government and tibetan people are open
1606346 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1606347 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1606348 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1606349 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy
1606350 just because someone doesnt love you the way you want them to doesnt mean they dont love you with all they have

1606356 while adolescent african american females remain a high risk group for stds little research has examined their marijuana use sexual behaviors and incidence of std infection
1606357 although no differences in condom use were identified between marijuana users and non users results suggest that marijuana users are engaging in sexual acts with riskier partners and under riskier circumstances and had higher rates of stds
1606358 weve identified the hepcidin binding site it will allow the diagnosis of underlying inflammation to distinguish diseases of iron metabolism that stem from hepcidin versus those with other causes
1606359 this test narrows it down to active hepcidin it can help us divine the effects of inflammation on body iron stores
1606360 so as we can see from this article the evidence for providing healthy foods for children can contribute to a better school year academically physically and socially
1606361 its kind of like if you have a car on a hill you pick up energy as youre going down but you give it all back up again when you go up
1606362 what is happening here is that the acceleration of the universe is forcing the gravity wells to be less strong so over the time it takes for energy to cross the cluster the strength of the cluster has diminished
1606363 our model is proposing a way that the brain processes temporal information and how this can vary over time
1606364 positive excitatory feedback originating from recurrent connections between the cells
1606365 it seems like when youre in a more flexible brain state its easier for you to redirect your attention to new and important things
1606366 perhaps the longer couples stay together the more they grow alike
1606367 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1606368 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1606369 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
1606370 the only reason to come here was to review the tensed situation here we were told that there is a situation of civil war here i would like to inform you that no abnormal situation is prevailing in singur and work is progressing well
1606371 even if any possibility of civil war arises local police and local administration has provided all necessary security arrangements to tata motors so that that they can continue their work here without any hindrance
1606372 everything is positive and its just about making sure we achieve what we want i think my outlook as captain rather than as a player will be totally different peter likes to challenge us on a daily basis there are a lot of strong characters in the england dressing room and opinionated people im convinced we can have a good relationship i wouldnt be here as captain if i wasnt 100 per cent confident of that
1606373 we wanted a captain who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role
1606374 what i like about kevin is he has a view thats going to be important in his captaincy hes passionate hes committed about the way he goes about his cricket
1606375 david has done what he set out to do to show very clearly that he is prepared to take on the leadership
1606376 hollywood should be more conscious while handling faith related subjects
1606377 i stand with many of my hindu brothers and sisters i will not watch this movie
1606378 it exhibits the bodacious repulsive iconoclastic sophomoric insulting stereotyping and illogicality
1606379 slew of seriously wince inducing jabs at indias culture horrible even when meant in fun
1606380 all these people interested in cricket buy tv licences and surely they have a right to expect that the public sector broadcasters mount bids for the nations summer sport after all just how many people play f1 the sun quoted clarke as saying
1606381 the bbc must answer to the millions of cricket fans about how it prioritises its investment in sports rights

1606392 in banks there are lots of difficulties and formalities to be fulfilled it becomes difficult for us to go daily for the formalities we went here once and got our loan and when the time comes to return the money back they collect it from us themselves

1606397 if aafia was carrying chemicals or liquids then why didnt the us government prosecute the case in 2003 what stopped them from doing so
1606398 with the us finally admitting custody of dr aafia siddiqui one of the most brutal cases of the suppression of individual freedom has begun to unravel public pressure has at last compelled the us to admit that dr aafia is in its custody while the pakistani government has belatedly begun to admit that it had some responsibility towards dr aafia it has a lot of explaining to do as to who had been detaining her and where she has been since she was picked up from karachi in 2003 along with her three children
1606399 the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of the truth an affront to peoples common sense
1606400 in the short term nevirapine is better than nothing but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1606401 it reinforces the need to treat these women with combination therapy thereby providing better prevention for the infant while providing better treatment for the mother public health efforts should continue to expand combination therapy so that mothers and babies arent left vulnerable to drug resistance

1606425 curlin couldnt win the haskell we could curlin got beat by a filly we havent our horse is undefeated on grass curlin isnt i dont know why people think curlin is such a good horse were way better than curlin
1606426 i think its bad for racing to have trash talk
1606427 to run down another guys horse i dont think its right it demeans the industry id like to meet big brown preferably on the dirt which is each ones best surface but i think theyre considering retiring big brown before we have a chance to meet him
1606428 it depends on whether big brown wants to evade us or wants to meet us
1606429 i find it interesting that jackson doesnt like trash talk because what he said sounds like trash talk to me im not upset at all about what rick said i dont think its wrong to say my horse is better than your horse
1606430 i think building a rivalry between horses is good for the game as long as its not personal curlin and big brown both have huge followings and i would love to have the opportunity to run against curlin
1606431 you take chances with curlin because hes such a splendid animal but you dont want a horse to get beaten by the surface and its inconsistency
1606432 because hes stabled at saratoga and the race is on dirt a surface where hes a champion
1606433 it sounds like plans for curlin are all over the place
1606434 all along our plan was to run big brown in the classic and hes never run on a synthetic track either curlin is the champion older horse and hes supposed to beat big brown if they meet ill have nothing to lose and it will be great for the game

1606442 seimone was with us for the world championships two years ago
1606443 she was really very much a role player for us we asked her to improve on the defensive end
1606444 seimone is a scorer she was a scorer her whole career
1606445 she has never had to produce at the other end of the court but several conversations later seimone is not only a great scorer but she has become a mainstay for us defensively i cant say enough about her progress in terms of what we need

1606452 while these online services now have millions of records available that is still a tiny percentage of all records available on paper or on microfilm
1606453 will these companies raise their prices in relation to other increases or will they maintain or possibly lower prices to keep subscribers
1606454 online services will provide much cheaper access than any other available method

1606500 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
1606501 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics

1606530 only one thing five months ago at fall festival johnny came to kiniwata and found himself a wife he paid her father eight cows
1606531 eight cows she must have beauty that takes your breath away
1606532 but the kindest could only call sarita plain sam karoo her father was afraid shed be left on his hands
1606533 but then he got eight cows for her isnt that extraordinary
1606534 i said it would be kindness to call her plain she was skinny she walked with her shoulders hunched and her head ducked she was scared of her own shadow
1606535 and thats why the villagers grin when they talk about johnny they get special satisfaction from the fact that the sharpest trader in the islands was bested by dull old sam karoo
1606536 they say theres nothing i might want they you cant help me get
1606537 always and forever when they speak of marriage settlements it will be remembered that johnny lingo paid eight cows for sarita
1606538 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information

1606541 this is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance and for this we labor and strive that we have put our hope in the living god who is the savior of all men and especially of those who believe

1606557 kind of a behind the scenes look at the soup and how i feel about television but theres also a lot of jokes about my family and things that i find funny and i talk about who ive pissed off ill be talking a lot about that
1606558 that was one of the reasons i took the show because the pedigree is so good
1606559 they all have gone on to do huge things kinnear getting a freaking oscar nomination and being a huge movie star and aisha being a big tv star of course ill be the first to fail at it

1606573 there had been some confusion on how long a single continuous period of driving was
1606574 intended to be a limitation placed on any abusive use of the law
1606575 if we had anything close to that that would hinder us
1606576 that would really be a nightmare to fit that criterion
1606577 all through the conversation he kept warning us repeatedly that he had very close connections with the governor of nevada and that is how he managed to get the other doctors visas in the first place
1606578 he said that he would use the governors office again to make sure that we could never leave
1606579 based on my personal visits to all these sites in the past three months none of them had any signs indicating the presence of a health care facility
1606580 munir muhamed had six j 1 waiver physicians approved for his alleged underserved clinics but four of those are still practically unemployed because he does not have the money to pay them
1606581 conspired to take advantage of physicians coming to this country on j 1 waiver visas in the hopes that they will not complain for fear of losing their immigration status and medical licenses
1606582 not to grant munir muhamed dr siddiqui or whoever represents the health care center of las vegas any further j 1 waiver physicians because he is abusing them not paying them in a timely fashion and making them work in areas that are not underprivileged
1606583 i dont know of anybody who has contributed more to nevada than bob maheu he was one of the most gracious men ive known he reminded me of ron reagan
1606584 there was a kind of commanding presence about bob maheu he was very charming elegant and very sophisticated there was never any doubt that when you were talking to bob maheu you were talking to a man with a commanding presence substance and style he carried himself with a sense of authority but not arrogance
1606585 he was a big part of our history in this state in the last 50 years he was a central figure in the development of las vegas and charming a great raconteur who had a great amount of history in his head in some ways he was as mysterious as mr hughes himself he loved his role and played it well
1606586 he didnt mention it by name the bay of pigs but he said he went home that night and told his wife eve to go to bed and then he put on some classical music
1606587 bob sat in his chair all that night and through the next day and did not move or say a word he was despondent because he knew the united states was not going to back the invasion he helped put together he knew those men were going to die and he couldnt do anything about it
1606588 he was a giant this guy a giant with a heart
1606589 bob maheu had as much to do with the transformation of las vegas as practically any other person who called las vegas home
1606590 when he came here in 1966 bob spearheaded howard hughes efforts to buy up a number of mobbed up hotels on the strip only men with mr hughes money and vision and bob maheus tenacity could have succeeded in ridding las vegas of mob influence
1606591 without bob maheu las vegas would be a very different and a far less successful place today
1606592 the others in the room got so jealous because bob was howards eyes and ears
1606593 they tried to gain howards favor and pitched their ideas to him like banning smoking and the consumption of alcoholic beverages in howards casinos
1606594 my father was a pioneer in so much history not just in las vegas but around the world and he was proud of that
1606595 if you think paying 3 or 4 a gallon for gasoline today is bad you can imagine what we would be paying if my father did not play a major role in scuttling that deal
1606596 and just remember if it turns out we have to kill the bastard dont do it on american soil
1606597 strong values and ethics who always acted in a manner he felt was in the best interest of his country
1606598 my fathers legacy is his children grandchildren and great grandchildren
1606599 though im no saint i am a religious man and i knew that the cia was talking about murder they cia bosses used the analogy of world war ii if we had known the exact bunker that hitler was in during the war we wouldnt have hesitated to kill the bastard
1606600 but in my mind justified or not i would still have blood on my hands if anything went wrong i was the fall guy caught between protecting the government and protecting the mob two armed camps that could crush me like a bug
1606601 in bobs darkest days following the hughes shake up he had one true friend that was my father hank greenspun
1606602 and bob returned that friendship to my family for the rest of his life
1606603 my heart still bleeds for what happened to howard hughes
1606604 i often said after i got off the phone with him that i just finished talking to the poorest man in the world he was so unhappy
1606605 we were so moved by the californian marriage of del martin 87 and phyllis lyon 83 who have been together 56 years that we wanted to be counted on this issue
1606606 im asking you to be as honest and raw with your words and attach an emotive photograph of you if single or you and your partner
1606607 it is easy to dismiss a list of names on a black and white petition and not connect with the real human tragedy and injustice of discrimination or the sheer possibility of love
1606608 i am my fathers only daughter and it would be an honour for both he and i to walk down the aisle to my future wife
1606609 because i am gay i am not equal under australian law he may die before we share that moment together
1606610 a country who does not recognise a group as equal under the law exposes that group to ridicule humiliation and a status of less than of course we are vilified attacked and cast aside
1606611 in return gay people pay taxes become pillars of society are not violent do not run in gangs do not start hate riots do not add to racial tension unlike other groups in society we embrace others without question and yet we still suffer institutionalised homophobia
1606612 i think we have done a good job to get a broad cross section of the community
1606613 this is the time for the greens the world needs to look at sustainablity and social justice in a way that it has never needed to before the old models of the powerful running the show have not served us with the environment
1606614 weve got very strong environmental policies that we want to advance in the city of sydney weve already done some interesting things the citys decision to go to 100 percent green power was a greens initiative
1606615 we the un system need to move to comprehensive business like programs to combat homophobia directly throughout the global south
1606616 were seeing rates of hiv infection among gay men in global south countries not seen since the invisible epidemics in the early 1980s in australia north america and western europe
1606617 australias contribution to hiv funding and expertise in the asia pacific region over the last decade has been considerable but only a miniscule portion of this has been allocated to gay msm programs
1606618 we want to know if men who report satisfaction with their penis size have higher self esteem and better body image than men who are dissatisfied with the size of their penis
1606619 if men believe that a large penis is the cultural ideal then this could affect how they perceive their general physical attractiveness
1606620 there has been quite a lot of research conducted on womens body image however we know very little about mens body image and the factors that impinge on the way males think about their bodies
1606621 so lets stop feeling sorry for ourselves enjoy a break and then find the confidence to make our case afresh
1606622 absolutely disgusting that you advertised to the world youth day freaks who hate gays
1606623 as a business weve made an effort to contribute to the gay community the sglba and almost every gay charity if people think its about greed they have no idea what its like running a business on oxford st
1606624 i really think this attitude has contributed to the decline of the area there are sectors within the community that are politically active and have very strong opinions and believe this street should belong to us
1606625 oxford st has to become a destination again for something other than night clubbing its a very sick area we just wanted to invite anyone to the restaurant whoever they are so we can pay our bills
1606626 this is the sort of separatist extremism that has done so much damage to the glbt community in the minds of the broader community and fuels the campaign of the reactionary right against us
1606627 my case is simply that potential donors should be screened for the safety of their sexual activity rather than the gender of their sexual partner
1606628 due to current legal proceedings underway in tasmania we are unable to comment on this issue
1606629 the ias joins global health professionals hiv advocates and concerned individuals in asking for their immediate release

1606632 we know a number of neighbours forced entry to the flat to save the occupants
1606633 they were able to bring the baby out of the flat and he was subsequently attended to by the ambulance service
1606634 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions
1606635 i have been meeting chinese leaders for seven and a half years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
1606636 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1606637 this is an athletics event but its also an opportunity to say to the chinese people we respect your traditions we respect your history
1606638 with gulmohar we want to increase the visibility of the south asian queer community in australia voice their emotions and express their feeling through films about and made in south asian countries
1606639 we also ultimately want to become part of the global vision for providing equal rights to the south asian glbt community
1606640 our position which i said before the election is that marriage is between a man and a woman and i dont mean any disrespect to same sex relationships but we think the right thing to do is ensure the legal discriminations which exist that the attorney general is working on are put behind us
1606641 my view is that im a member of the party the party has a very clear view and its a view lets be frank that is supported by the vast majority of australians
1606642 ive been a member of parliament for six years now and ive put my view forward on a range of issues inside the party room and the party comes to a position there are obviously people in the community who dont share this view
1606643 it just goes to show that homophobia is still rife on the central coast
1606644 can we expect the same sort of numbers to participate in the 2009 mardi gras festival it would be a brave person who would answer this question in the affirmative
1606645 a degree of consolidation would seem prudent although we should continue to explore other areas where we can diversify our income base
1606646 we have come a long way in building confidence and creating a more viable financial model
1606647 however after a very big year such as this one there is an inevitable feeling of well what next
1606648 i do not believe mardi gras best years are behind it but to forge into the future we will need to demonstrate a new vision for the festival
1606649 we are working closely with government and corporate bodies to ensure the continued sustainability and growth of the organisation and the festival
1606650 there does appear to be light at the end of this long tunnel as our discussions proceed with the newly formed events nsw
1606651 we are considering various new events to add to our calendar with a particular focus on exclusive member events but we are still in preliminary planning at the moment so youll have to stay tuned for specifics
1606652 there would be people who have been practising for weeks in the lead up to this
1606653 there are couples who take it very seriously but that doesnt mean that people who are new to dancing should feel left out there are special rounds on the night where new dancers can register to dance with a more experienced person we want them to join in on the night everyone can have a go its not as hard as you think
1606654 we get a really mixed crowd particularly with the spectators
1606655 there are gay and lesbian people but there are usually a lot of straight friends there offering support it really took off after the ballroom event at the sydney gay games and we try to recreate that same atmosphere of inclusiveness and energy each year
1606656 the most enjoyable part of the night and of the sport though is the fact that it is same sex couples it allows you to dance with your partner and make a very public statement about your relationship and commitment to each other even more so than other glbt sports it really does make a public declaration of being together which i think can be quite a liberating thing for the couples involved
1606657 despite some dire predictions uk television advertising held up relatively well over the first half of the year and through the summer
1606658 itv estimates that total net advertising revenue for the eight months to august will be down one per cent year on year with itv plc net advertising revenue flat
1606659 however on current estimates the television advertising market has weakened significantly in september where trading is impacted by tough comparisons with the successful rugby world cup in 2007

1606683 weve done this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights record on tibet
1606684 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1606685 its absolutely critical that a message is sent to the chinese government to meaningfully address and end violence and repression in tibet or they will never be truly accepted by the international community
1606686 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1606687 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding

1606703 they are unique in that they are not just the authors of their own works they have produced something else the possibilities and the rules for the formation of other texts in this sense they are very different for example from a novelist who is in fact nothing more than the author of his own text

1606834 i am not going to travel frequently just this once lemme pay
1606835 i dont know that theres ever been this level of unified support for the concept of olympic golf
1606836 if you look at the celebrity of our athletes the commercial appeal of the sport the long time culture and integrity and value system of the sport is very consistent with the olympic ideal
1606837 i dont know if ill still be playing by the time it came in but if im still competitive it would be nice it would be a nice feather if you like to keep me working ive always loved the olympics
1606838 we condemn this intimidation by the police they are flagrant violations of press freedom
1606839 we call on the government to put an end to these attacks on journalists journalists are trying to do their job professionally and peacefully and should be supported

1606841 we beweren niet dat terroristen dit al vandaag de dag bij alle paspoorten kunnen doen of dat dit ze morgen lukt maar het laat zien dat beveiliging op een publieke en open manier moet worden aangepakt
1606842 het resultaat van het al dan niet bewust niet implementeren van alle beveiligingsmaatregelen
1606843 om in de toekomst de veiligheid van het elektronische paspoort te kunnen garanderen is het noodzakelijk dat dergelijke belangrijke publieke systemen open ge valueerd kunnen worden in het verleden is onder meer met de stemcomputers en de ov chipkaart gebleken dat gesloten systemen uiteindelijk niet goed beveiligd hoewel een gedeelte van de paspoort specificatie beschikbaar is tegen betaling is de uitlees apparatuur niet open gedocumenteerd en ge valueerd het is noodzakelijk dat niet alleen het document maar het gehele systeem kan worden bestudeerd
1606844 dit geval laat zien dat malware niet alleen voor financieel gewin wordt gebruikt maar dat ook voyeurs het kunnen gebruiken iedereen moet het belang van computerbeveiliging zien om te voorkomen dat ze niet het slachtoffer van afpersers of voyeurs worden
1606845 risalta in maniera evidente la sfasatura tra pericoli reali e interventi concreti per fronteggiarli il luogo di lavoro e la strada mancano ancora di presidi efficaci per garantire la piena sicurezza dei cittadini
1606846 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
1606847 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1606848 in my country and in many other countries in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode
1606849 public opinion and political opinion was moving toward an actual boycott of the games and it was only the earthquake tragedy that diverted attention from what could otherwise have been something very very serious
1606850 this should not have been in the glare of press discussions in august 2008 as we have all known that this could be a problem ever since beijing were elected and we should have taken whatever steps necessary
1606851 there will be though a review of what happened when we come to audit the games when they are over
1606852 let he who is without sin cast the first stone
1606853 as far as his ability to compete we wont make any decisions until the last possible moment
1606854 no one is panicking right now were pretty optimistic about whats going to happen and brandons ability to be able to compete
1606855 its still pretty swollen but he was able to put some weight on it this morning
1606856 i think the biggest rival in beijing will be myself but i really dont want to think about it
1606857 i honestly do not know if i can ever be the same runner again
1606858 but mind you if there is any person on the planet who is capable it is him
1606859 they wanted more green space says a 53 year old man who did not want his name used fearful of reprisal for speaking to a western reporter
1606860 my family has lived here for more than a hundred years over three generations the man continues
1606861 we are not squatters we pay 30 yuan 4 56 a month in rent the government said theyd pay us 30 yuan a month to move but the cheapest housing i could find anywhere else was 60 yuan a month
1606862 we all are proud that the games have come to china but they have made life even more difficult for many of us to me it feels like the government is robbing us of the little we have
1606863 but what can we do we only hope the wall will come down after the olympics are over i dont think so though i think we will have to leave
1606864 i was happy to have lived here all my life but theres not much left of this place any more nearly everyone has gone

1606866 what they actually make a farmers bible what its dumbed down for the farmers well incredible
1606867 in the futility of their thinking they are darkened in their understanding because of the ignorance that is them
1606868 some people get caught up with the patriotism aspect of it but im going to enjoy it and do the best i can to represent russia
1606869 i love our country i love what we stand for this is an opportunity to fulfil my dream of playing in the olympics
1606870 i still dont know what makes me so fast and so successful
1606871 i know that when i see a hurdle in front of me i just go tackle it
1606872 the olympics are a great thing we definitely have to hang out a flag to show we too love our country

1606875 one curious thing that separates the social from the natural sciences is that the natural sciences with much fanfare immediately communicate to the general public their most exciting new ideas the social sciences tend to nurse their significant insights in scholarly oblivion as a result people feel that the social sciences are not doing anything important or exciting but the opposite is true probably the most thrilling and potentially liberating discoveries have been made in the fields of anthropology sociology psychology and pyschiatry the result is that we are today in possession of an excellent general theory of human nature and this is what i want to reveal to the reader
1606876 if it wasnt for one of my teammates letting me use one of his sleeping pills i definitely wouldnt have gotten to sleep that night and it might have even ruined me for the next day
1606877 i know that for the olympics im going to get some wada world anti doping agency approved sleeping pills its nerve wracking it sucks
1606878 i usually fall asleep quite easily but its sort of a restless sleep where i get up once or twice and struggle to fall back asleep
1606879 i try not to think about it and just fall asleep but you cant help it knowing that tomorrow is the day tomorrow is the day that ive been waiting for the past four years then you start sleeping then you wake up because you have funky dreams or weird dreams
1606880 but sometimes for me when i dont sleep that good it gives me an extra little something im on the edge during the whole day because i didnt sleep very good its not a bad thing necessarily
1606881 my brain goes like crazy and i think about the race and i think about the outcome which i shouldnt be doing
1606882 theres a rule you get as much sleep as you can two nights before because the night before you generally have a hard time sleeping
1606883 i dont work myself up over that kind of thing
1606884 theres nothing im going to be able to do the night before to change how im going to do that day except to get a good sleep
1606885 id suggest we havent done our job it if becomes an issue just the night before they compete at the games
1606886 we try to persuade athletes to put in place a number of different strategies
1606887 the only trouble i have is dreams i have wild and wacky dreams
1606888 before the sydney olympics i had dreams that i was crossing the fencing room and that my coach was on the other side and i was wearing flip flops and there were all these horned beetles and their horns were coming through the flip flops and i woke up in a panic

1606893 the blokes see it that if you are unlucky you get wounded and go to the uk at the mercy of the nhs but if you get a head wound you get sent to ramstein in germany where the us has an outstanding medical facility
1606894 it also does not do morale much good knowing that within 18 hours of being wounded you could wake up in a nhs hospital with a mental health patient on one side and an incontinent geriatric on the other

1606938 you made this mess heres a pick and a bloody shovel get on with it
1606939 there are in india certain wild asses which are as large as horses and larger their bodies are white their heads dark red and their eyes dark blue they have a horn on the forehead which is about a foot and a half in length the dust filed from this horn is administered in a potion as a protection against deadly drugs the base of this horn for some two hands breadth above the brow is pure white the upper part is sharp and of a vivid crimson and the remainder or middle portion is black those who drink out of these horns made into drinking vessels are not subject they say to convulsions or to the holy disease epilepsy indeed they are immune even to poisons if either before or after swallowing such they drink wine water or anything else from these beakers other asses both the tame and the wild and in fact all animals with solid hoofs are without the ankle bone and have no gall in the liver but these have both the ankle bone and the gall this ankle bone the most beautiful i have ever seen is like that of an ox in general appearance and in size but it is as heavy as lead and its colour is that of cinnabar through and through the animal is exceedingly swift and powerful so that no creature neither the horse nor any other can overtake it
1606940 the orsaean indians hunt an exceedingly wild beast which has a stags head elephants feet and a boars tail the rest of its body being like that of a horse it makes a deep lowing noise and one black horn two cubits long projects from the middle of its forehead this animal they say cannot be taken alive
1606941 this animal is as large as a full grown horse and it has a mane tawny hair feet like those of an elephant and the tail of a goat between its brows there stands a single black horn not smooth but with certain natural rings and tapering to a very sharp point
1606942 god brought them out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of the unicorn
1606943 his glory is like the firstling of his bullock and his horns are like the horns of unicorns with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth
1606944 save me from the lions mouth for thou hast heard me from the horns of unicorns
1606945 he maketh them the cedars of lebanon also to skip like a calf lebanon and sirion like a young unicorn
1606946 but my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of the unicorn i shall be anointed with fresh oil
1606947 and the unicorns shall come down with them and the bullocks with their bulls and their land shall be soaked with blood and their dust made fat with fatness
1606948 will the unicorn be willing to serve thee or abide in thy crib
1606949 canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow
1606950 wilt thou believe him that he will bring home thy seed and gather it into thy barn
1606951 christ is meant be this animal and the horn denotes christs cross
1606952 there is an animal called dajja extremely gentle which the hunters are unable to capture because of its great strength it has in the middle of its brow a single horn but observe the ruse by which the huntsmen take it they lead forth a young virgin pure and chaste to whom when the animal sees her he approaches throwing himself upon her then the girl offers him her breasts and the animal begins to suck the breasts of the maiden and to conduct himself familiarly with her then the girl while sitting quietly reaches forth her hand and grasps the horn on the animals brow and at this point the huntsmen come up and take the beast and go away with him to the king likewise the lord christ has raised up for us a horn of salvation in the midst of jerusalem in the house of god by the intercession of the mother of god a virgin pure chaste full of mercy immaculate inviolate

1607019 now they want to tax me for driving back in i dont like the idea of government sticking their hands in our pockets every time they need a solution to a problem caused by poor planning
1607020 there are power and gas rates that also put a premium price on use during peak demand why not roads too
1607021 they should be encouraging people to use motorcycles to reduce congestion and pollution
1607022 we feel drawing an arbitrary line around part of the san francisco to charge a fee doesnt make sense
1607023 io che non aspiro alla gloria non ho torto di passare la mia giornata disteso sul sof senza battere una palpebra e trovo molto ragionevole lusanza dei turchi e degli altri orientali che si contentano di sedere sulle loro gambe tutto il giorno e guardare stupidamente in viso questa ridicola esistenza

1607026 david has done what he set out to do to show very clearly that he is prepared to take on the leadership
1607027 it sits on the shelf there as one of the 50 projects that i have to deal with
1607028 its very hard to come up with stories for that thing you know its really impossible because it has to be real it has to be something that actually happened it has to be something people know about it has to be supernatural its a really difficult research project which theyre researching now you know and last time it took 14 years
1607029 spielberg is more amenable to the idea of a further installment than he was last time around
1607030 with the writers strike it took so long to get underway and roger avary the writer had a commitment that was in line before working the wolfenstein stuff but ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
1607031 he would love to reprise his role as the former secret service agent
1607032 no i think he was true to his word he didnt want to guard celebrities anymore
1607033 preferisco restare nuda che mettere un animale morto sul mio corpo
1607034 normally based on my past experiences it has been the night before the game when we have quarterback meetings so we will find out then
1607035 as far as how much weight goes into it who knows youll have to ask the guy thats making the decision
1607036 its important to all of us to go out there and have a good showing
1607037 its going to be an overall evaluation and i dont know how games are weighted but they evaluated everything we do whether its in the classroom out here on the field one on ones routes versus error everything if its on film or they can film it coach evaluates it
1607038 i try not to pay attention to where chad is at i root for him just like i root for anybody but for myself i understand that there was a string of practices where there were some interceptions and they needed to be put to an end
1607039 i think as veterans once the preseason rolls around you know that the dog days of training camp are slowing winding down
1607040 we are excited to try to take what we have learned and practiced on the practice field and take it and apply it in a game situation
1607041 ik miste nog wel wat kracht om mijn oefening lekker door te komen
1607042 ik sliep slecht en voelde me niet fit maar over het algemeen gaat het wel aardig het is jammer dat ik mijn oefening tijdens de podiumtraining niet lekker kon neerzetten gelukkig kon het publiek mijn oefening wel waarderen want ik kreeg nog wel een mooi applaus
1607043 e n hersteldag was blijkbaar nog niet voldoende om in topvorm te zijn ik was wel weer fitter dan dinsdag en heb nog een paar goede beurten kunnen maken de komende twee dagen zal ik wel wat rustiger aan doen zodat ik zaterdag weer fit ben
1607044 i know youre great but there are a lot of other books out there i could be reading right now
1607045 i wanted to be free of you so badly but now that youre gone i cant help but think of all the impossibly rich detail and hilarious anecdotes you contained or the way you nailed dialects and were just generally infuriatingly well wrought in about every way and the way you made me feel like a shittier writer but made me want to be a better one also you said some pretty beautiful things about irony and how its a lot like poison sometimes and you said some pretty beautiful things about a ton of other stuff too
1607046 traditionally britains standard definition is 30 per cent better than our standard definition
1607047 it sure didnt look like he ran into him on purpose
1607048 it seems they are very sensitive about anyone seeing anything to do with the rehearsals for friday nights big show the opening ceremony
1607049 there was nothing going on but when i started taking pictures of workers inside the stadium two chinese police officers came over individually to get me to stop
1607050 one wanted to take away my camera the other said the words delete pictures of course i refused i got off with a warning and he escorted me out of the stadium
1607051 where is the man responsible for this where is the director of electricity ill track him down
1607052 we dont push too hard against the taliban or the government
1607053 we say general things to avoid trouble security is not good electricity is not good people are moving away from kandahar the municipality does nothing about the garbage in the streets but we dont say anything about specific leaders
1607054 why arent you building factories to employ our young people
1607055 if we make factories for young people who will fight how will i get my money from foreign governments
1607056 everything is more expensive now even spoiled pakistani fruit is selling for high prices the ngos try to help by giving us wheat but people steal it and smuggle it out of the country
1607057 he always covered his sorrow with a smile and his pain with a joke
1607058 i decided to make myself famous and get some money

1607062 tim burton would have killed me if i hadnt done it because hes such a terminator fan ive been in big movies before like apes and fight club was big in a different way and charlie and the chocolate factory and sweeney todd were big but ive never been in this kind of big popcorn action movie a male one an action one
1607063 i still dont know how it will play out with this one they showed me some footage but i dont have a feel for the movie i didnt see enough i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star of the hero these are the things that determine the success and how the stong the movie
1607064 ive seen very little footage so i dont really have a feel for it i hope they do well and i hope it is a huge hit i do hope it creates a spectacle on the screen that is what james cameron created
1607065 this is a 90 minutes presentation time is up i gotta go

1607071 het is veel te vroeg om daar zo over te spreken reageerde woorvoerder gennadi sjvets van het russische noc woensdag in peking op de uitlatingen van arne ljungqvist hoofd van de medische commissie van het internationaal olympisch comit ioc
1607072 maar het is vreemd dat iemand dan direct van systematisch dopegebruik spreekt aldus woordvoerder sjvets
1607073 is not this the fast that i choose to loose the bonds of wickedness to undo the straps of the yoke to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke

1607076 our business plan is not so much about the movie business its really to build a global digital distribution business its based on the expectation that in the not too distant future most content will be delivered digitally and on demand
1607077 dat klopt inflatie zegt alleen iets over verandering van prijzen niets over de hoogte ervan als grondstofprijzen nu stabiliseren gaat de inflatie straks omlaag bij beleggers maakt de inflatieangst dan ook weer plaats voor recessieangst dat is minder erg want dat geeft uitzicht op mogelijke renteverlagingen door de ecb
1607078 in de komende maanden zien we nog een piek in inflatie de olieprijs in euros nu 78 euro per vat is nu 41 hoger dan een jaar geleden als de olieprijs gelijk blijft zien we vanaf november 2008 een steeds minder effect hiervan op de inflatie dat is net op tijd net voordat het een echt effect op onze lonen krijgen
1607079 graffiti is a non violent crime and these men represent no threat to society
1607080 i stood there completely baffled for about an hour outside of the tate to tell you the truth i quite like it but it really confused me a lot i know that half if not all of the graffiti that is on the tate modern building is done by people who do illegal graffiti or have done illegal graffiti and have made their name doing that it is like theyre saying yeah were on the edge of the law yet were being shown by one of the biggest galleries in london and its sponsored by nissan

1607087 we will continue working with talented youth after the summer camp as well including helping participants with follow up activities such as organizing roundtable debates and creating their own ngos or initiative groups
1607088 when i was going through my hard time recently she was immediately on the phone asking me how i was doing and saying i hope youre well

1607092 jesus mary and joseph trace this thing weighs a ton i thought you were writing a novella
1607093 it was a novella but when i told you a month ago that i was having problems padding out the plot you told me put a girl in it
1607094 thats what i did sir i put a girl in it and boy did that gum up the works
1607095 put a girl in it as you suggested which i did well then things start going haywire and the plot gets out of hand and the damn page count grows what the hell else happens when you introduce a woman into the equation
1607096 believe me i understand but excise the woman from the plot and ill bet youve got nothing ill have a look at it tonight are you having the steak or the halibut

1607100 wall street maakte dinsdag de op vier na sterkste stijging van het jaar door er was sprake van shortcovering sectorrotatie een stijgende dollar en een dalende olieprijs kortom er gebeurt nogal wat
1607101 dat wordt uitgelegd als een hint voor het uitblijven van een renteverhoging het is lastig met de huidige inflatieniveaus maar de risicos voor de economische groei in de vs liggen duidelijk aan de onderkant
1607102 de perikelen rondom hypotheken huizenprijzen en kredieten zijn even naar de achtergrond verdwenen de aex moet woensdag boven de 400 punten blijven en een slot boven de 408 is een sterk koopsignaal
1607103 omv revokes its intention published on september 25 2007 to make an offer to shareholders of mol of 32 000 hungarian forints 136 2 euros 211 35 dollars per share
1607104 the european commission has indicated that it would not accept commitments that omv had proposed since other commitments would be unacceptable to omv omv has decided to withdraw the merger notification filed with the european commission on january 31 2008
1607105 de sectoren die het hardst werden geraakt door de gestegen olieprijs doen het nu het best
1607106 de lange en korte rentefutures blijven positief maar zullen woensdag naar verwachting hun winst beperken
1607107 er is duidelijk opluchting dat de olieprijs daalt de nationale rente zijn piek heeft bereikt en de fed wat tijd heeft genomen om te zien of de inflatie daalt
1607108 het probleem is dat de rentepiek historisch gezien de markt vaak met vertraging beinvloedt
1607109 for the period 1 july 2007 to 30 june 2008 inclusive ebitda before significant items was 652 9 million dollars in line with ascianos previous market guidance
1607110 the decision on which businesses to monetise hasnt been reached yet
1607111 all businesses are going through an intensive capital planning process and on the basis of finalising those well have a clearer picture in terms of which businesses well look at
1607112 all options remain open for enhancing the value to our securityholders
1607113 the board will keep an open mind of course for an offer of the whole company that reflects fair value
1607114 my my my can you imagine what we all thought two or three years ago what a shocking circumstance
1607115 quande dumane ti mitt in cavalle di schioppettate ars ne la valle
1607116 this takes you through the handbook of what not to do
1607117 we support our employees who we believe took appropriate actions at the time of the incident
1607118 we continue to review our practices and protocols in the wake of this tragedy and will respond further at the appropriate time
1607119 the disappointment i have is knowing theyll never be able to get those boys out
1607120 i see those bodies in that black hole totally covered in coal
1607121 fire us all it wasnt just me it was fire us all and get more players if we couldnt get it in that book the way he wanted it
1607122 my husband is a coal miner my dads a coal miner my brothers a coal miner
1607123 it does carry a risk thats why theyre paid so well but the coal mines actually are pretty safe i think what happened at crandall murray got a little greedy and was robbing coal where he shouldnt have been taking it out
1607124 well glance at the news in the morning and see that our country is at war well observe the death and destruction shake our heads collectively and mumble isnt that terrible and then well turn back to our morning cereal
1607125 now it is my career and i have to face it
1607126 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1607127 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1607128 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
1607129 but its between this government and joey as a private citizen
1607130 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1607131 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1607132 of course i would have liked to have been there advocating for a peaceful resolution
1607133 theres more emphasis in the league on defense and running the ball now than when i first came in
1607134 theyre invoking a classic catch 22 there cant be an appealable flaw if the specification is approved because weve defined it out of existence
1607135 de beste manier om deze ongerustheid weg te nemen is door middel van toetsing
1607136 ik ben een kritisch ioc lid en als het nodig is zal ik hierover zeker de microfoon pakken dat doe ik wel vaker mijn argument is niet alleen de traditie maar ook de zeer hoge kosten
1607137 de realiteit is dat dit mooie symbool van de hoop doelwit van protest is geworden door de enorme mediabelangstelling is de tocht hier ideaal voor door het herstellen van de oude traditie voorkom je tevens dat dit olympische symbool kapot gaat
1607138 sport gaat altijd voor politiek dat wil niet zeggen dat ik de wereld zwart wit zie de olympische gedachte is er een van verbroedering en daarvoor is nodig dat atleten uit alle landen zonder problemen naar de spelen kunnen reizen op de achtergrond speelde eind 19e eeuw ook dat men hoopte nooit meer een grote bloedige oorlog mee te maken de verenigde naties roept niet voor niets alle strijdende partijen in de wereld op tot een wapenstilstand zodat sporters vrij en zonder gevaar naar de olympische spelen kunnen komen die wens stamt al uit het oude olympia
1607139 ik herinner me verder dat tijdens de openingsceremonie van de spelen in sydney 2000 red voor het eerst beide koreas het stadion binnen liepen er ging een rilling door me heen miljarden tv kijkers waren getuige van dit historische moment verder ben ik blij dat irak op de valreep toch meedoet in peking hun onverwacht succesvolle olympische voetbalteam zorgde tijdens de vorige spelen in athene voor verbroedering in de straten van bagdad
1607140 it was the first day in pads and to be honest it was the first day i have been disappointed with the energy effort and enthusiasm that we had
1607141 it wasnt great working in an office and looking at everybody and thinking is this really what i want to do i was really missing the camaraderie and the guys and all that i wasnt ready to be done
1607142 its too early to think its all going to stay that way theres still a lot of games left and season left so were just going to stay on doing what works
1607143 to my knowledge this is the first time qbs has been mandated by law by a provincial government
1607144 the government of quebec seems to truly understand how to achieve value and sustainability
1607145 they have shown that they understand the importance of properly investing in engineering and architectural services
1607146 well be targeting municipalities next which are governed by a different law
1607147 the legislation raises the bar and sends a message to other governments that the best way to achieve long term value to taxpayers and realize savings over the life cycle of a project is to invest in quality upfront design
1607148 the quebec government has sent a message that it is not going to do things on the cheap it is going to do things right
1607149 mary kate heeft niets te maken met de medicijnen we hebben justitie na de dood van de heer ledger alle informatie gegeven die er te geven viel dit hebben we in chronologische volgorde gedaan zodat er geen misverstanden konden ontstaan daarnaast hebben we ook verteld dat mevrouw olsen ook de herkomst van de medicijnen niet weet
1607150 we felt that salt and caramel is a good pairing
1607151 the ice cream is nice and pure with a savory taste
1607152 it has a rich saturated caramel flavor without being too rich like the others
1607153 the crunchiness of the chocolate the saltiness and the rich texture is a tongue taste pleasure
1607154 de nederlandse transportsector staat onder druk naast de hoge brandstofkosten zijn er nog veel meer problemen zo kan het niet verder
1607155 truckers worden door allerlei regels veredelde boekhouders zonder het salaris dat daarbij hoort
1607156 een chauffeur die door files een paar minuten te lang doorrijdt om thuis te komen kan daarvoor tot 28 dagen later in een ander land alsnog een boete krijgen van wel 1500 euro nederland is hierin coulant maar frankrijk spanje itali en oostenrijk niet
1607157 in een vrachtauto zitten nu al vaak meer dan vijf systemen
1607158 de arbeidstijden moeten ruimer om het einde van de west europese transportsector te voorkomen straks rijden er alleen nog oost europeanen
1607159 hij is altijd een mooie tegenstander om tegen te racen het is echter zijn keuze om zijn focus elders te leggen

1607161 when the bobcats hired him it showed me they were committed to making the franchise better
1607162 hiring larry brown an elite coach you have to take notice of that
1607163 larry brown he brings a certain dynamic and insight to the game that would make most teams better
1607164 people seem to recognize me everywhere and its been great
1607165 when i go to the black neighborhoods people relate to me and when i go the jewish neighborhood they relate to me too
1607166 the floodgates have been opened by the federal and alberta governments
1607167 its now clear that the ever increasing use of exploitable guest workers has become a central plank in the tories strategy to deal with the tight labour market in alberta
1607168 the alberta government has lately been attempting to paper over some of the big holes left in the temporary foreign worker program by the federal government but these are little more than band aid solutions
1607169 the real problem is that guest worker programs are bad public policy no matter how you dress them up
1607170 i dont find this surprising at all given the state of the economy in both provinces in the last five years
1607171 for b c and alberta there is more of an appetite for bringing foreign workers in to complement the workforce i think that we are seeing a peak in the number of temporary foreign workers in 2007 with the plateau in residential construction and the completion of major infrastructure projects

1607175 this is far superior to my own strip in every regard oh wait this is my strip well now im just confused

1607178 you have had childhood experiences that have made you different which you hate yet cannot deny but you try to bury them for all sorts of reasons

1607187 im going home right now and make a fresh bean salad just lemon good olive oil parsley and garlic i can hardly wait
1607188 oh those beans look terrible with those shriveled damp looking pods
1607189 chefs are looking for larger beans they are less work to shell
1607190 cocos cocos get your fresh cocos for soupe au pistou
1607191 whats funny about these shelling beans is that theyre so simple to make taste good all the work is in getting them out of their shell
1607192 empire has more than tripled its field installation and shop fabrication capacity over the past two years and is in an excellent position to fulfill these types of contracts
1607193 we started assembly in october of this year and the work will be undertaken over a period of about 15 months
1607194 about 20 modules will be worked on at the same time and there will be a continual flow of modules being built and shipped to the site
1607195 this is the first time a b c division of the company has been involved in upgrader construction
1607196 this is a strategic move by empire industries to get more involved in the upgrader construction market
1607197 we are pleased to have reached a balanced long term agreement with the teamsters
1607198 this project has been on the books and underway since 2005
1607199 we are now turning our attention back to the gateway which we have done since early 2008
1607200 we are in the pre regulatory phase and need to establish a proposed pipeline route
1607201 we are doing a number of engineering and environmental studies to establish the most appropriate proposed route
1607202 we are on a timeline to file our application for regulatory approval in 2009
1607203 if the project is approved construction will start in 2011 and the completion is scheduled for 2014
1607204 the project will create tremendous opportunities for b c based general contracting companies who are interested in excavation and clearing the right of way
1607205 there is a strong economic rationale behind the project and we dont put much credence in discussions surrounding the american election
1607206 the principle sounds great but there is a difference between standards and barriers
1607207 what does this mean for a program like red seal we have to wait for the fine print to see how it all works out
1607208 the issue they are looking at is right but their focus is wrong in my view
1607209 the lowering of standards is a real negative impact for the trades it does not just lower the quality of work but a better trained worker is a safer worker
1607210 tradespeople across canada have faced archaic and inconsistent rules when seeking work in another province for too long
1607211 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
1607212 in conclusion its merely slopping and wishful thinking to believe both to be true moreover i dont think someone will go deep into what either tradition has to offer by trying to straddle both how could one both traditions in themselves have so much to offer there are more than enough practices in each respective tradition to keep an aspirant busy for many lifetimes christians and buddhists need to learn to mine their traditions more carefully rather than picking and choosing according to their personal fancies

1607214 youve written a pretty damn good piece of work here one that in my view will find a publisher worth having it reads relentlessly and ends very well

1607217 chris williams microsofts director of product development explained his attitude to software piracy in the far east were just flooding the market with copies the goal is that when people actually end up having to buy software they will already know our software and its the one they will have to buy when the laws get passed were basically getting market share as soon as we start to get a return on that investment it will be humongous
1607218 but microsoft and our co sponsors intel and hewlett packard went further and have agreed that our patents essential to implementing c and cli will be available on a
1607219 id like to explain why ive never felt emphasis mine the two are in conflict
1607220 but lets not waste our time on this discussion on the mailing list forlegal matters you should get legal counsel have your lawyers engage microsoft on this topic that is the only way of getting a solid answer

1607228 you know the one thing we went back and shot was a lot of shots of people loading guns and stuff because we knew we could just put them anywhere and they were good cutting pieces
1607229 youve officially been referenced these shots are directly referencing your movie and it only came out a year ago
1607230 the wildcard in pineapple express is david gordon green a director known for offbeat beautiful semi improvisational indie films like george washington and all the real girls hes an unconventional directorial choice for a mainstream action comedy but his impeccable eye defies the indifferent visual style of most judd apatow productions and he has a glancing touch that keeps the violence from mucking up the fun

1607242 and to ryan i heard about this before the pr mess and negative propaganda was spread on the net and all it caused was me and others reconsidering if we should even try to get involved or just ignore it but after seeing that at least a part of the community here is actually interested in improving things and working on this me carl and others have decided to try and support them dont think this only happened cause of your whining and complaining on the contrary i recommend you some anger management training and hope you will think about what your trying to achieve and how you can achieve it first next time next time if you cant open a door you might want to try ring the bell or try another door instead of using explosives to blow the doors and windows open and cause a mess for everybody on the entire block all you achieved is discrediting yourself and unfortunately a part of the open source community to foxconn the press and even the ftc congratulations thats quite an achievement in only one or two weeks you know what microsoft should hire you and more people like you to do just what you did here if they really want to sabotage the open source community
1607243 youre welcome and i thank the several hundred thousand of you it obviously took to get weasel con to listen

1607249 rather than a problem to be dreaded and combated falling prices through increased production is a wonderful long run tendency of untrammeled capitalism the trend of the industrial revolution in the west was falling prices which spread an increased standard of living to every person falling costs which maintained general profitability of business and stable monetary wage rates which reflected steadily increasing real wages in terms of purchasing power this is a process to be hailed and welcomed rather than to be stamped out

1607253 i want my hat and coat please i find i have to go away at once
1607254 if i choose to give you gold why should you complain
1607255 i want to threaten you with the worm that dieth not and the fire that is not quenched
1607256 it was represented to me that the same could be done at the cafe anglais nothing like it sir
1607257 i have great apprehensions your fish plates they are cleared away with the knife and fork on them
1607258 you see the waiter who took them away you know him
1607259 i know not when or why he come i send my waiter to take away the plates and he find them already away
1607260 always count em as i come in they look so queer standing up against the wall
1607261 there never have been more than fifteen waiters at this place and there were no more than fifteen tonight ill swear no more and no less
1607262 only you did not for one of zem is dead upstairs
1607263 that fifteenth fellow was a thief down at once to the front and back doors and secure everything then well talk the twenty four pearls of the club are worth recovering
1607264 perhaps i have got what you are looking for gentlemen
1607265 valuable things to deposit in a cloak room arent they
1607266 but i know something of his fighting weight and a great deal about his spiritual difficulties i formed the physical estimate when he was trying to throttle me and the moral estimate when he repented
1607267 that a thief and a vagabond should repent when so many who are rich and secure remain hard and frivolous and without fruit for god or man but there if you will excuse me you trespass a little upon my province if you doubt the penitence as a practical fact there are your knives and forks you are the twelve true fishers and there are all your silver fish but he has made me a fisher of men
1607268 i caught him with an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long enough to let him wander to the ends of the world and still to bring him back with a twitch upon the thread
1607269 he must have been a clever fellow but i think i know a cleverer
1607270 but i am not quite sure of what other you mean
1607271 i dont want to get the fellow jailed make yourself easy about that but id give a good many silver forks to know exactly how you fell into this affair and how you got the stuff out of him i reckon youre the most up to date devil of the present company
1607272 i mustnt tell you anything of the mans identity or his own story of course but theres no particular reason why i shouldnt tell you of the mere outside facts which i found out for myself
1607273 i was shut up in that small room there doing some writing when i heard a pair of feet in this passage doing a dance that was as queer as the dance of death first came quick funny little steps like a man walking on tiptoe for a wager then came slow careless creaking steps as of a big man walking about with a cigar but they were both made by the same feet i swear and they came in rotation first the run and then the walk and then the run again i wondered at first idly and then wildly why a man should act these two parts at once one walk i knew it was just like yours colonel it was the walk of a well fed gentleman waiting for something who strolls about rather because he is physically alert than because he is mentally impatient i knew that i knew the other walk too but i could not remember what it was what wild creature had i met on my travels that tore along on tiptoe in that extraordinary style then i heard a clink of plates somewhere and the answer stood up as plain as st peters it was the walk of a waiter that walk with the body slanted forward the eyes looking down the ball of the toe spurning away the ground the coat tails and napkin flying then i thought for a minute and a half more and i believe i saw the manner of the crime as clearly as if i were going to commit it
1607274 is like any other work of art dont look surprised crimes are by no means the only works of art that come from an infernal workshop but every work of art divine or diabolic has one indispensable mark i mean that the centre of it is simple however much the fulfilment may be complicated thus in hamlet let us say the grotesqueness of the grave digger the flowers of the mad girl the fantastic finery of osric the pallor of the ghost and the grin of the skull are all oddities in a sort of tangled wreath round one plain tragic figure of a man in black well this also
1607275 this also is the plain tragedy of a man in black yes
1607276 the whole of this tale turns on a black coat in this as in hamlet there are the rococo excrescences yourselves let us say there is the dead waiter who was there when he could not be there there is the invisible hand that swept your table clear of silver and melted into air but every clever crime is founded ultimately on some one quite simple fact some fact that is not itself mysterious the mystification comes in covering it up in leading mens thoughts away from it this large and subtle and in the ordinary course most profitable crime was built on the plain fact that a gentlemans evening dress is the same as a waiters all the rest was acting and thundering good acting too
1607277 i tell you that this archangel of impudence who stole your forks walked up and down this passage twenty times in the blaze of all the lamps in the glare of all the eyes
1607278 his worst moment was when the waiters stood in a row but even then he contrived to lean against the wall just round the corner in such a way that for that important instant the waiters thought him a gentleman while the gentlemen thought him a waiter the rest went like winking if any waiter caught him away from the table that waiter caught a languid aristocrat he had only to time himself two minutes before the fish was cleared become a swift servant and clear it himself he put the plates down on a sideboard stuffed the silver in his breast pocket giving it a bulgy look and ran like a hare i heard him coming till he came to the cloak room there he had only to be a plutocrat again a plutocrat called away suddenly on business he had only to give his ticket to the cloak room attendant and go out again elegantly as he had come in only only i happened to be the cloak room attendant
1607279 i think i understand his professional trick but i dont seem to have got hold of yours
1607280 ive been looking for you everywhere the dinners going again in spanking style and old audley has got to make a speech in honour of the forks being saved we want to start some new ceremony dont you know to commemorate the occasion i say you really got the goods back what do you suggest
1607281 i should suggest that henceforward we wear green coats instead of black one never knows what mistakes may arise when one looks so like a waiter
1607282 reverend sir your friend must have been very smart to act the gentleman
1607283 it must be very hard work to be a gentleman but do you know i have sometimes thought that it may be almost as laborious to be a waiter
1607284 can zoom in and see whats happening here and press the government to take the necessary corrective action

1607289 i had a great time working at cetrella but i live in oakland and wanted to be more connected to oakland
1607290 i love the diversity of italian food and have traveled to italy quite a bit for me its perfectly natural
1607291 people who were going out three or four times now were only going out once not ordering wine or dessert
1607292 one need not have a natural inclination for the religious life on the contrary a divine vocation is compatible with a natural repugnance for the state

1607314 im a strong proponent of the restoration of the wetlands for a lot of reasons theres a practical reason though when it comes to hurricanes the stronger the wetlands the more likely the damage of the hurricane
1607315 but its the common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and i on you
1607316 no a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she is waiting now in the sitting room now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance
1607317 my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything
1607318 my name is sherlock holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha i am glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the fire pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you are shivering
1607319 we shall soon set matters right i have no doubt you have come in by train this morning i see
1607320 no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dog cart along heavy roads before you reached the station
1607321 the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a dog cart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the left hand side of the driver
1607322 i started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues i have no one to turn to none save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful
1607323 ah yes i recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara i think it was before your time watson i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend as to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter
1607324 the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but i have heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me
1607325 my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey
1607326 the family was at one time among the richest in england and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west
1607327 but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time
1607328 last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure
1607329 you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has
1607330 she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position we had however an aunt my mothers maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a half pay major of marines to whom she became engaged my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but wlthin a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion
1607331 it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory the manor house is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sitting rooms being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms the first is dr roylotts the second my sisters and the third my own there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain
1607332 the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn
1607333 tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night
1607334 i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep
1607335 because during the last few nights i have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle
1607336 no i have not it must be those wretched gypsies in the plantation
1607337 very likely and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you did not hear it also
1607338 well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock
1607339 was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night
1607340 i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked
1607341 i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew that it was my sisters voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen as i ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it horror stricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by the light of the corridor lamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not recognized me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was the band the speckled band there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctors room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing gown when he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister
1607342 are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound could you swear to it
1607343 that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived
1607344 no she was in her night dress in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a match box
1607345 showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did the coroner come to
1607346 he investigated the case with great care for dr roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by old fashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end besides there were no marks of any violence upon her
1607347 what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then
1607348 it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine
1607349 ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a band a speckled band
1607350 sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gypsies in the plantation i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used
1607351 two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage his name is armitage percy armitage the second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dog cart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice
1607352 miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather
1607353 there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action yet we have not a moment to lose if we were to come to stoke moran to day would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather
1607354 as it happens he spoke of coming into town to day upon some most important business it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way
1607355 then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself
1607356 i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town but i shall return by the twelve oclock train so as to be there in time for your coming
1607357 and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some small business matters to attend to will you not wait and breakfast
1607358 no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon
1607359 it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business
1607360 yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end
1607361 what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman
1607362 when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gypsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines
1607363 and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of the devil
1607364 my name sir but you have the advantage of me
1607365 i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i have traced her what has she been saying to you
1607366 it is a little cold for the time of the year
1607367 i know you you scoundrel i have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler
1607368 when you go out close the door for there is a decided draught
1607369 i will go when i have said my say dont you dare to meddle with my affairs i know that miss stoner has been here i traced her i am a dangerous man to fall foul of see here
1607370 i am not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own
1607371 fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter
1607372 to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the total income which at the time of the wifes death was little short of 1100 pounds is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than 750 pounds each daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds in case of marriage it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent my mornings work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket an eleys no 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a tooth brush are i think all that we need
1607373 yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott
1607374 but if you want to get to the house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the foot path over the fields there it is where the lady is walking
1607375 yes i think we had better do as you suggest
1607376 that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business it may stop his gossip good afternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as our word
1607377 all has turned out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening
1607378 we have had the pleasure of making the doctors acquaintance
1607379 he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what will he say when he returns
1607380 he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him tonight if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine
1607381 this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to dr roylotts chamber
1607382 exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one
1607383 pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall
1607384 there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room
1607385 ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there are windows in it of course
1607386 yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass through
1607387 as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters
1607388 my theory certainly presents some difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter
1607389 yes it was only put there a couple of years ago
1607390 no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves
1607391 indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell pull there you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor
1607392 no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is
1607393 there are one or two very singular points about this room for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air
1607394 yes there were several little changes carried out about that time
1607395 they seem to have been of a most interesting character dummy bell ropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment
1607396 only once some years ago i remember that it was full of papers
1607397 no we dont keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon
1607398 ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine
1607399 its a common enough lash but i dont know why it should be tied
1607400 that is not quite so common is it ah me its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn
1607401 that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect
1607402 the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may depend upon your compliance
1607403 in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room
1607404 yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the village inn over there
1607405 you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night
1607406 we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you
1607407 i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind
1607408 then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters death
1607409 i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak
1607410 you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright
1607411 no i do not think so i think that there was probably some more tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain good bye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you
1607412 i have really some scruples as to taking you to night there is a distinct element of danger
1607413 you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me
1607414 no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more i imagine that you saw all that i did
1607415 i saw nothing remarkable save the bell rope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine
1607416 yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through
1607417 i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran
1607418 oh yes i did you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylotts cigar now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroners inquiry i deduced a ventilator
1607419 well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies does not that strike you
1607420 it was clamped to the floor did you ever see a bed fastened like that before
1607421 the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope or so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bell pull
1607422 i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
1607423 subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful
1607424 we must sit without light he would see it through the ventilator
1607425 do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair
1607426 and perhaps after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylotts room
1607427 the deadliest snake in india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened
1607428 come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data
1607429 i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it
1607430 this event is one of its kind where you will hear real world stories from industry peers amp experts with scheduled breaks amp an informal setting there will never be a dull moment on the cruise
1607431 rather than people coming and telling us what we have
1607432 respond swiftly to any public health threat in the country
1607433 that we can master and phase in the other things
1607434 but what dna does is that it checks for the actual virus and so it is able to diagnose the child much earlier than the eighteen months
1607435 the dna equipment would also have a platform for hepatitis b and hepatitis c viruses
1607436 but that test for hpv is something still in discussion but the equipment that we are buying has a platform for that but we would have to look at the cost factor
1607437 we would continue to do all the chemistries for the hiv population we would continue to do all the haematology for all the persons in that population and in that programme
1607438 a lot of training will be happening to ensure that we can accomplish everything
1607439 we would monitor ourselves in house and also the other labs and we would be part of an international proficiency testing body so we would ourselves be monitored by an international body
1607440 there is a lot of overlapping things and one of the things that we would have to do is to have clear definition as to when it is that the reference public health lab is needed and when it is that the other agencies are needed so that would be a continuous discussion to come up with who does what when
1607441 access to the man in the street would be restricted for the mere fact that it is a reference laboratory so we dont want people to be running in and out the complexity of the tests and the complexity of the facility would require that the man in the street not to have direct access to the facility however should the man in the street have a concern he would be referred through one of the peripheral laboratories to the reference lab so if there is something he needs to have tested they would take the sample and so we would have communication with them so you cant walk into the lab and say you want to have a test it is highly secured
1607442 w hen we cease to consider what the criminal deserves and consider only what will cure him or deter others we have tacitly removed him from the sphere of justice altogether instead of a person a subject of rights we have an object a patient a case

1607447 music for relief was established to respond to natural disasters to help victims recover and rebuild
1607448 we hope our efforts in china will provide assistance to people affected and continue to raise international awareness about the reconstruction related projects
1607449 ticketmaster is extremely proud to be part of this significant project
1607450 we will work closely with the artists and china development marketplace to ensure the music for relief china concerts are a great success and significant contributions are made to the cso projects

1607460 est rodeada de una gran falta de planificaci n organizaci n y presupuesto situaci n que no permite lograr el objetivo para el cual fue creado que es esclarecer la mayor cantidad de delitos en menor tiempo
1607461 aunque hayan pasado dos a os consecutivos de venir peleando por esta situaci n no bajaremos los brazos
1607462 la corte no puede hacerle firmar a nadie instrumentos que atenten contra el derecho laboral argentino

1607464 no veo c mo puede ser v lido un contrato firmado que diga que el 1 de mayo no tiene que devolverse como feriado
1607465 nosotros advertimos de esta situaci n cr tica ser a bueno que en la paritaria del pr ximo martes la corte lleve soluciones concretas
1607466 si bien esto se estaba tratando en paritarias ese tratamiento ya lleva dos a os
1607467 por un lado la corte pretende eficacia y eficiencia en la gesti n pero a la vez demora dos a os en solucionar estos temas lo que digo es que cuando la corte es invitada a debatir formalmente en la paritaria sobre las condiciones de trabajo no lo hace sino que dilata los tiempos
1607468 da la impresi n de que les cuesta much simo negociar pero sobre todo les cuesta mucha reflexionar sobre las cosas que est n mal planificadas con el nuevo c digo procesal penal

1607473 like everyone bill rewrote his life the recollections of an older man are different from those of a younger man what seemed vital at forty may lose its significance at seventy we manufacture stories after all from the fleeting sensory material that bombards us at every instant a fragmented series of pictures conversations odors and the touch of things and people we delete most of it to live with some semblance of order and the reshuffling of memory goes on until we die
1607474 dad what are we going to do theres nothing to watch on tv and i cant get to myspace what are we supposed to do
1607475 well thats why we come here you have to settle into a simpler kind of living
1607476 you can draw you can read you can feed chipmunks you can go for a walk you can play cards or dominos you can i dont know make up stuff to do find stuff to do people used to do that all the time
1607477 uh okay or maybe we could just dig our own graves
1607478 well there is a vcr and a television the tvs not hooked up to cable or an antenna so you cant watch television shows but i think there might be a couple of movies if you need a little help getting adjusted

1607490 in 1994 we applied to get games played here on a permanent basis but in december 1994 there was a big devaluation of the money here
1607491 i wrote a letter immediately to the major leagues to tell them to retire my proposal because the country was not in a condition to host a team
1607492 aber das sind eindeutig keine guten nachrichten und k nnte sorgen bei den anlegern wecken
1607493 palfinger konnte im 1 halbjahr organisch und durch akquisitionen weiter wachsen das schwierige marktumfeld geht auch an uns nicht spurlos vor ber aber wir sind gut aufgestellt und sehen gleichzeitig in einigen unserer m rkte enormes wachstumspotenzial f r das gesamtjahr 2008 rechnen wir daher mit zweistelligem umsatzwachstum
1607494 die heutige ank ndigung markiert den n chsten schritt unserer strategie ein bedeutender spieler auf dem platin markt zu werden

1607496 im zuge des trends zum zweit pc ist dies ein entscheidender vorteil
1607497 el sistema gubernamental del pa s estaba paralizado por las injerencias judiciales
1607498 wir legen unsere it seit ber zehn jahren in die h nde von eds
1607499 f r uns als bank ist es enorm wichtig einen it partner zu haben der die zuverl ssigkeit unserer prozesse und transaktionen sicherstellt
1607500 die entscheidung von sal oppenheim ist eine best tigung f r unsere hervorragende zusammenarbeit in der vergangenheit
1607501 ich bin fest davon berzeugt dass wir auch in zukunft einen entscheidenden beitrag f r den erfolg von sal oppenheim leisten werden
1607502 now they generally contend that going beyond pre doha bound rates will be retrograde and should only occur in the most serious situation they therefore contended that to go beyond bound rates volume must increase 140 of base imports developing countries india and china in particular have contended that by the time these volumes are reached poor farmers will be out of business starving or dead
1607503 we are interested in ssm but i suspect that there would have been a carve out for sves that would have allowed them to go beyond pre doha rates along the lines suggested in the text
1607504 the caribbean and others has been arguing for the recognition of sves for some time and our countries are prominent members of this group just as we are prominent members of the acp group which deals with the problem of preference erosion that is a major concern of ours
1607505 we have been told that the ec will declare 2 rice lines as sensitive and if this is applied to husked rice then a greater protection of our preferential margin will result
1607506 it must be obvious that unless the entire philosophy of world trade changes radically the movement towards continuous liberalization of which the current negotiations is but a stage cannot simply end the current world is set on a liberalizing path that may pause but will certainly continue again even if with a different emphasis
1607507 hay trabajadores judiciales clase 14 del m s bajo escalaf n del r gimen del poder judicial que est n haciendo trabajos que deber an hacer los fiscales
1607508 el c digo procesal penal cpp es una gran mentira de la justicia al pueblo mendocino tal como se encuentra actualmente
1607509 en definitiva el responsable siempre termina siendo el fiscal o el ayudante de fiscal porque son los que ponen la firma
1607510 reclaman mayor seguridad en su lugar de trabajo y est n en una comisar a piden refrigerio cuando los polic as no lo tienen protestan por la limpieza de los lugares de trabajo y a lo sumo son seis personas en el lugar

1607512 we have met and in fact exceeded our financial targets again this year
1607513 at the same time we were able to make some crucial investments to grow our economy
1607514 in addition to the funds budgeted in 2007 for debt reduction we have a crown share agreement that will further reduce the debt this year
1607515 we have also committed to applying the rest of the crown share settlement to the surplus in the years ahead
1607516 twenty homes for 20 families is a wonderful opportunity for all of us
1607517 if it hadnt been for a habitat house id still be renting

1607519 guys are selling drugs in broad daylight and you are afraid to walk out the door
1607520 the children cant get in to use the parks because of drug activity
1607521 our neighborhood organization is trying to put an end to all of the crime but its hard to keep up
1607522 its showing us in a different perspective than when we are going around arresting people
1607523 it gives people a chance to talk to us and for us to give them a better insight into what we do
1607524 we are hoping that the free food will bring people out to have some fun
1607525 ive met a lot of folks for the first time today
1607526 were here to educate kids on fire safety and prevention
1607527 youve got to manage the to do list dont just stick it in your pocket and forget about it
1607528 my goal with all of this is to show where we are what we have accomplished and what we have left to do
1607529 we had to get everything organized because it would become kind of a mess if we didnt have a structure
1607530 for the vast majority of them its a decision for the police chief to determine how he uses the resources under his control
1607531 this difficult decision comes as a direct result of the ongoing crisis in the housing and financial industries
1607532 the management would like to express our sincere thanks to our dedicated employees our vendors and the thousands who have trusted our company to build their homes in the triad
1607533 certainly sales are not what they were 18 months ago to 2 years ago
1607534 in most cases a builder borrows a certain percentage of the construction of the house including the land value
1607535 theyre anticipating a turnaround on the sale of that property within six months of the completion of the property
1607536 unfortunately it was a bit of a trend where builders were still building at the same pace and purchasers were not purchasing at the same rate
1607537 some of it is just plain economics that occur when you have builders that are building a lot of houses they have more on the line with the banks and banks have been a little less friendly with everybody
1607538 our fuel costs have gone from being 14 percent of our costs to 24 percent
1607539 but ladies and gentlemen thats about like putting a band aid on an open wound
1607540 i think mr mccain has a more comprehensive solution to this problem than we got from mr obama
1607541 partly its how good are they at following through with whatever approach they take
1607542 we were told by the consultant that we werent overstaffed at all
1607543 its determining what the priorities are and its what the community says the priorities are
1607544 if a government is impatient and they want really big savings really quickly thats tough
1607545 they can just slash costs but in all likelihood that will have a damaging effect
1607546 try to find a way to spend those first few months with your child give your child time to feel safe and bond with you it could potentially save you many problems later

1607572 reds has been supporting numerous sports successfully in guyana and this is a tangible way of reinforcing this
1607573 i recall however that gecom personnel went out of the way to perpetually emphasise that a host of mechanisms were in place to prevent multiple voting
1607574 mr klass colin cannot shed some light on our accommodation up to today yesterday whilst the general secretary is on his way to beijing china and mr hudson has no knowledge on our accommodation
1607575 they the gff need to know that this is not just about the digicel tournament or even the world cup qualifier but with a broader scope in mind carifesta which is just around the corner
1607576 when we hosted guyana in june for the first leg of our world cup qualifying encounter we ensured that the accommodation they received was of a high standard thus we were anticipating the same on our visit here for the return encounter but sad to say such was not
1607577 even for this digicel tournament efforts were made to contact the executives of the guyana football federation including its president colin klass general secretary noel adonis and even guyana manager rawle hudson which were all in vain
1607578 there are some concerns by the officials in suriname about security to which the gff have not given any response either
1607579 mr kumar called me this morning yesterday and told me that he saw what happened the last time our team was here and does not want a reocurrence of same and to this effect he has promised to arrange not only accommodation but also security transportation and even priority crossing with the ferry at new amsterdam and rosignol for the team to which we are entirely grateful
1607580 we will be putting all challenges behind us and focusing on the job at hand as the digicel cup is an important part of the rebuilding process of guyanas football this is so as there are cadres of players who are at the evening of their careers e g charles lily pollard collie hercules and richard reynolds whilst another cadre of players are waiting to get their international careers going including devon millington kanata manning and kester jacobs just to name a few
1607581 even the coaches myself included must make way for people like wayne dover dennis france and joseph wilson who are quite capable and with the right exposure can take guyanas football forward
1607582 we must do well in this tournament including getting a good result against our nemesis suriname and advance to the next round of matches in november and to this effect we had one session yesterday monday and another this morning yesterday with the final session being scheduled for this afternoon tuesday at the national stadium
1607583 we had the full squad yesterday morning and the guys were very enthusiastic about the session but i must say that i am not impressed with the level of fitness displayed by them and i would have liked for it to be higher than where it is right now
1607584 we are trying to get howard newton to join the squad and there is a possibility that he will be here in time for the second game against suriname but we will include a couple of locally based players and even though randolph jerome has a ticket issued to him by the gff for some unknown reason he is not here and if he does not want it devon millington dwight peters and kevin beaton want it and these youngsters are thirsty for football and such a thirst can only be quenched with international exposure
1607585 our guys are motivated to play and we welcome the challenge of playing under the lights as we are a bunch of professionals and we are placed in a position to give of our best with the two sessions that we have had so far we had to rely a lot on what we have done in the past and the effort and determination are two deciding factors in us getting a good result against dominica
1607586 we cannot guarantee anything else but a total effort going into this match allah will decide if guyana deserves to go forward whilst our job is to do everything possible to bring the result
1607587 i am pleased with what i have been given on the technical side of it these guys are professionals now and people in guyana must appreciate that players like hercules pollard mc kinnon and reynolds are full time professionals and i am happy with the commitment they have shown not only to guyanas football but their football lives in general

1607950 ill go get it from my room it may be a tad wrinkled but i was in such a hurry to make sure it was put away safely
1607951 after all i simply couldnt wear your dress when my parents had to take such time and effort to get me one plus i hear from them so rarely

1608037 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1608098 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days mccain and im not promising change like that other guy obama im just hot
1608099 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1608100 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1608101 and now i want to present my energy policy for america just after i finish reading this article on where i can fly to to get the best tan oh maui
1608102 barack wants to focus on new technology to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling
1608103 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
1608104 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which would then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved

1608106 i being a punjabi can play the role i portray in mere pind more emphatically than anyone else
1608107 but when manmohanji offered me a role in mera pind i could not decline because i found my role to be very close to my heart
1608108 but not right away well be doing it next year ill produce a film and its not really a period film it would be a period film but it wont feel like one
1608109 by that i mean itd be very contemporary in terms of actions and emotions but in order to make those actions and emotions credible the plot will be set in the past part of my character might have some thugi traits but i dont play a thug as defined in the history books
1608110 id love to make films for kareena and my sister soha but i dont have to star in all my productions see initially the whole idea was to give myself a chance to produce films and do the roles i wasnt being offered
1608111 now when im in my first three productions being directed by imtiaz ali sriram raghavan and homi adajania i dont mind playing just the producer in future
1608112 it was a big headache getting proper permissions i got a wonderful architect renu cheniani doing up the place she had earlier done up my office and i loved what she had done i needed a larger home the kids keep coming home to stay
1608113 i think this hall is marvellous and offers a large variety
1608114 i think the major reason is that people can watch indian movies on the big screen and can see the original print instead of the poor quality pirated cds
1608115 it provides the perfect atmosphere for film viewers indian movies have added real colour to the artistic building
1608116 i believe the exchange of movies can prove instrumental in sustainable peace between the two countries
1608117 this is a welcome step and both countries should liberalise their policies of exchanging movies dramas and songs its always good to see pakistani singers like atif aslam in kismat konnection singing for indian movies
1608118 he was the icon of peace and love among the people of the two countries
1608119 i think its a beautiful place and movies here are very attractive i think now the screening of indian movies should continue
1608120 though its a masala movie i think kismat konnection is number one among the five movies being screened here
1608121 none of the playback singers voices match that of shahid kapur and i wish i could have such a lavish lifestyle and drive a racing car like the hero does in the movie without any job and money

1608126 i asked him tell me im wrong that youre playing again for all the right reasons
1608127 i thought he was extremely emotional last spring i thought his decision to un retire was emotional he told me that wasnt the case so i have to respect that
1608128 i never thought through this whole process that he was going to play this year if im wrong then im wrong
1608129 i just know we were at practice today and favre wasnt there and im the starter
1608130 i think weve been pretty united throughout this whole thing its definitely been difficult for all parties involved but weve tried to stay focused as a team
1608131 its gone on long enough the franchise needs to say one way or another we want brett or we dont want brett if they dont do it then brett needs to say he wants to be here or not be here
1608132 for them to keep us in the dark and have us answering a bunch of questions we cant possibly have a good answer for that isnt fair to us something needs to be said yea or nay for brett favre
1608133 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction
1608134 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons

1608138 america is sitting on top of a super massive 200 billion barrel oil field that could potentially make america energy independent and until now has largely gone unnoticed thanks to new technology the bakken formation in north dakota could boost americas oil reserves by an incredible 10 times giving western economies the trump card against opecs short squeeze on oil supply and making iranian and venezuelan threats of disrupted supply irrelevant
1608139 leigh price a scientist with the u s geological survey published a study in 1999 that estimates the bakken shales formation which underlies much of several western and northwestern counties may hold up to 400 billion barrels of oil by comparison the arctic refuge oil reserve is estimated at 16 billion barrels
1608140 the goal is to have every aircraft using synthetic fuel blends by 2011
1608141 by 2016 we hope at least 50 percent of this fuel will be produced domestically
1608142 americans will never hear about huge oil and gas reserves in the united states which if ever tapped would bring todays fuel prices at least as low as 1 50 per gallon and make america more energy independent

1608186 ich wurde aufgrund meiner doppelkompetenz als religionsp dagoge auf der einen und als wirtschaftspraktiker und manager auf der anderen seite eingeladen mich zu bewerben
1608187 zugleich gab ich zu erkennen meine bewerbung zur ckziehen zu wollen wenn sie nicht gewollt w re
1608188 er dr ckte nach dessen pr fung den wunsch aus ich solle doch meine bewerbung bitte aufrecht erhalten
1608189 am tag meiner wahl lud mich der bischof mit meiner frau zu einem entspannten abendessen ein das in guter atmosph re verlief
1608190 im gegenteil unmittelbar nach der wahl beantragte der gleiche bischof der mich sp ter ablehnte in rom f r mich das nihil obstat dies entsprach wohl der bisherigen gepflogenheit
1608191 tats chlich baute sich ein gutes arbeitsverh ltnis mit den engsten mitarbeitern aber auch mit der universit tsleitung auf
1608192 ein nihil obstat ist f r den pr sidenten nur bei p pstlichen universit ten n tig w hrend bei katholischen universit ten das wort des gro kanzlers also des zust ndigen bischofs z hlt
1608193 tats chlich kam aber kein einziges gespr ch mit einem der bayerischen bisch fe zustande
1608194 gleichzeitig wollten ger chte nicht verstummen erst die harte haltung von bischof m ller aus regensburg bischof mixa aus augsburg der dies dementierte und erzbischof marx aus m nchen h tten die sache im negativen sinn ins rollen gebracht
1608195 gerade erst war kardinal wetter in ruhestand gegangen und kardinal lehmann vom vorsitz der deutschen bischofskonferenz zur ckgetreten
1608196 ich werde sie nicht ernennen und daf r auch keine gr nde nennen diese entscheidung ist definitiv
1608197 ich lehnte dies ab die sache ist schon den ganzen tag ber das radio gelaufen ich sehe keinen sinn darin die entscheidung zur ckzuhalten
1608198 diese behauptung ist definitiv nicht richtig was mir der bischof pers nlich am folgetag best tigte
1608199 auch wenn man es dreht und wendet ein einseitiger wunsch ist noch lange keine zweiseitige vereinbarung
1608200 auch dies ist schlicht nicht wahr so traurig diese aussage ist
1608201 es passiert ja nicht jeden tag dass hinter dem r cken unzutreffende pressemeldungen ber einen verbreitet werden
1608202 denn ich habe mich fr h dazu entschlossen mir durch diesen vorgang weder meine glaubens noch meine lebensfreude nehmen zu lassen
1608203 denn es w re falsch das eigene kirchenbild am verhalten einzelner bisch fe festzumachen

1608231 the fact that miracle working belongs to the historical jesus is no longer disputed
1608232 we are convinced and hold it for historically certain that jesus did in fact perform miracles the miracle reports occupy so much space in the gospels that it is impossible that all could have been subsequently invented or transferred to jesus
1608233 jesus the nazarene practiced magic and deceived and led israel astray
1608234 the chaste ethical and redemptive nature of the miracles of christ
1608235 jesus was manifested to your race and healed those who were from birth physically maimed and deaf and lame causing one to leap and another to hear and a third to see at his word and he raised the dead and gave them life and by his actions challenged the men of his time to recognize him
1608236 it is false to think that jesus contemporaries considered him to be a magician
1608237 pagan miracles lack the dignity of biblical miracles they are frequently grotesque and done for very selfish reasons they are seldom ethical or redemptive and stand in marked contrast to the chaste ethical and redemptive nature of the miracles of christ nor do they have the genuine attestation that biblical miracles have

1608285 esto qued como una postura firme de este ministerio y ahora esperamos la respuesta de esta entidad sindical
1608286 una vez que esto se defina si hay acuerdo del sutef se conformar n las comisiones t cnicas para ver de qu manera se redistribuye este monto en funci n de lo que estipule el gremio
1608287 del ltimo esfuerzo que hace el gobierno provincial para el mejoramiento del salario docente as que esperamos que la entidad sindical la entienda de esta manera para que podamos comenzar a trabajar en la grilla que represente la distribuci n que el sindicato defina para los trabajadores de la educaci n
1608288 necesariamente debe haber un marco de armon a con los pibes en las aulas y los edificios p blicos liberados para que la gente pueda realizar sus actividades cotidianas
1608289 de que el sutef levante las medidas de fuerza desocupen los edificios p blicos tomados y no discutir salarios de ac al 31 de diciembre
1608290 desde la oposici n vemos que la propuesta es concreta
1608291 y creemos que ser a conveniente que el sindicato cese con las medidas de fuerza y que los chicos vuelvan a clases
1608292 de que las cuatro horas que dur el debate hayan sido fruct feras y que los chicos puedan tener clases nuevamente
1608293 satisfaga las expectativas del sutef y que ma ana los chicos puedan volver a las aulas

1608302 the average pay differential between the public and private sector was between 17 percent and 21 percent
1608303 in addition public sector workers appear to benefit much more from a warm glow belief that in their job they can help others and that their job is useful to society
1608304 in competitive labour markets people would be willing to work for less to feel so good about themselves and their jobs
1608305 so the fact that public sector workers actually get paid 20 percent more is evidence of how out of line wage setting has been in the public sector

1608314 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1608315 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1608316 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

1608319 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1608320 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

1608357 i call on the belarusian authorities to suspend any further examination of this draft and its entry into force
1608358 once this legislation comes into force it will restrict freedom of information in the country even further especially when it comes to electronic media and will extend the power of the authorities to interfere with media activities in a way which is contrary to european standards
1608359 what is more even before its entry into force the new draft law is bound to have a chilling effect of self censorship on the media given the forthcoming parliamentary elections this gives particular and acute cause for concern

1608389 i dont have any plans as of yet for the weekend so a movie sounds nice but it does suspiciously sound like a date i have not been on one in years but
1608390 i have been asked out on a date before and it sounds a lot like that
1608391 you like seafood i know a good seafood shop wait a minute your a 5 foot 3 freaky gay scientologist and your telling me youve been asked on a date before
1608392 i think will wright has said that the first level was pac man the second level was diablo the third level was populous and the fourth level was civilization
1608393 obviously spore comes from a very strong pedigree and the title itself looks dynamic
1608394 certainly the expectations are very high sales of several million units but i wouldnt put it in the realm of
1608395 amongst gamers theres this expectation that spore is going to be good in many ways he gets a free pass
1608396 i think they dont need to appeal to anybody outside the hardcore wright and sims fans
1608397 needs to sell in the millions and last a few years to pay back the investment but you know we were probably going to spend the money on something it might as well be on spore
1608398 we dont provide financial breakouts for individual titles or any formulas we use in determining financial performance
1608399 that said i can tell you that no one at ea is measuring spore with the yardstick created by the sims theyre two totally different animals spore is a game that has a lot to offer players long after they make the original purchase a much different business model than traditional video games
1608400 while its important to have an actual game within the game
1608401 i think gamers are so fascinated already with the creature creator and the ability to make buildings and spaceships that their expectations are going to be a lot lower than what ea would need in another game
1608402 i think part of it will result from word of mouth and viral marketing
1608403 is it something that people want to talk to their friends about friends and family taking notice and saying gee i want to do that as well its a little bit premature to say definitively whether spore will do that or not
1608404 until i sit down and play the game end to end i just cant judge
1608405 its like the four blind men trying to describe an elephant ive had a chance to play various parts of the game but until i get a chance to play it all i just cant say
1608406 tapping into a new mood in government of lets share
1608407 there is a growing recognition that no organisation including the state can do everything and a willingness to say lets see what happens if we put information out there
1608408 more and more departments seem to understand that they need to let go and see what people can do
1608409 it was our subscribers who said we like patient opinion but we are also seeing information on nhs choices so we now have to go to two places
1608410 we thought that should not be necessary given the way the web works
1608411 the mash up is useful for users and for subscribers because they get information about all the comments that are being made in one place
1608412 what we are really interested in is getting information and turning it into something of real benefit to the nhs and its users we felt that nhs choices could do more with the information it had
1608413 our subscribers include trusts patient groups interested in particular conditions and mps who want to know what is happening in their constituencies people who can really use information to make a difference
1608414 we are definitely looking at doing more because there are some very interesting things on there
1608415 but not right away well be doing it next year ill produce a film and its not really a period film it would be a period film but it wont feel like one
1608416 by that i mean itd be very contemporary in terms of actions and emotions but in order to make those actions and emotions credible the plot will be set in the past part of my character might have some thugi traits but i dont play a thug as defined in the history books
1608417 id love to make films for kareena and my sister soha but i dont have to star in all my productions see initially the whole idea was to give myself a chance to produce films and do the roles i wasnt being offered
1608418 now when im in my first three productions being directed by imtiaz ali sriram raghavan and homi adajania i dont mind playing just the producer in future
1608419 it was a big headache getting proper permissions i got a wonderful architect renu cheniani doing up the place she had earlier done up my office and i loved what she had done i needed a larger home the kids keep coming home to stay

1608428 presedintele oricum va sustine in curand o conferinta de presa de totalizare in cadrul careia se va referi la toate problemele de actualitate
1608429 nu avem inca un raspuns trebuie sa mai asteptam putin
1608430 am sunat la presedintie pentru acreditari in 2008 ni s a spus ca s a renuntat la acreditari iar pe viitor accesul in presedintie se va face pe baza de legitimatii am mers la conferita si ne am pomenit ca serviciul de presa al presedintiei nici nu a facut un comunicat despre conferinta a facut invitatii nominale

1608434 how can you stare at another mans hairy ass and find that attractive
1608435 just a warning it could get worse before it gets better
1608436 i think this hall is marvellous and offers a large variety
1608437 i think the major reason is that people can watch indian movies on the big screen and can see the original print instead of the poor quality pirated cds
1608438 it provides the perfect atmosphere for film viewers indian movies have added real colour to the artistic building
1608439 i believe the exchange of movies can prove instrumental in sustainable peace between the two countries
1608440 this is a welcome step and both countries should liberalise their policies of exchanging movies dramas and songs its always good to see pakistani singers like atif aslam in kismat konnection singing for indian movies
1608441 he was the icon of peace and love among the people of the two countries
1608442 i think its a beautiful place and movies here are very attractive i think now the screening of indian movies should continue
1608443 though its a masala movie i think kismat konnection is number one among the five movies being screened here
1608444 none of the playback singers voices match that of shahid kapur and i wish i could have such a lavish lifestyle and drive a racing car like the hero does in the movie without any job and money

1608450 barack wants to focus on new technology to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling
1608451 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
1608452 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which would then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved

1608645 israel is not a country delist it from facebook as a country
1608646 this was one of the most vile most anti semitic most pro jihad and most disgusting and most importantly most active hate groups on the internet

1608700 die familienunfreundliche und blockierende vp nieder sterreich soll sich an ihren steirischen parteikollegen ein beispiel nehmen und auch in nieder sterreich den gratiskindergarten am nachmittag unterst tzen die sp n wird weiterhin daf r k mpfen dass kinderbetreuung am nachmittag nicht von der finanziellen leistungsf higkeit der eltern abh ngig ist bis zu 80 euro sind f r viele familienbudgets einfach eine nicht zu untersch tzende ausgabe
1608701 nieder sterreich sollte sich ein beispiel an der sp gef hrten steiermark nehmen dort wird nicht nur der kindergarten ganztags kostenfrei sondern alle kinderbetreuungsformen sollen durch ein neues f rdermodell unterst tzt werden gerade f r junge nieder sterreichische familien im l ndlichen raum ist die vereinbarkeit von familie und beruf oft ein schwieriges unterfangen dies zeigt auch die tatsache dass in unserem bundesland nur 2 55 prozent der kinder in einer betreuungseinrichtung so untergebracht sind dass den eltern ein vollzeit job m glich w re mit dieser quote liegt unser bundesland am vorletzten platz in nieder sterreich gibt es also noch viel zu tun vor allem die anbieter von kleinkinderbetreuung werden seitens des land noch immer sehr sparsam gef rdert was wohl in der ideologischen ablehnung solcher betreuungsformen seitens der vp begr ndet ist f r viele eltern werden die elternbeitr ge in kleinkinderbetreuungseinrichtungen zur immer gr eren belastung auch hier ist das land gefordert zus tzliche unterst tzungen zu leisten
1608702 die wirtschaft begr t die beschlossene vollprivatisierung der austrian airlines als schritt in die richtige richtung
1608703 die vereinbarte sperrminorit t von 25 prozent plus einer aktie tr gt wesentlich zur absicherung des wirtschaftstandorts sterreich und des flughafens wien als drehkreuz im herzen europas bei das beispiel der swiss hat uns gezeigt dass die restrukturierung einer airline mit einem starken partner machbar ist
1608704 wir w rden uns auch w nschen dass die operativen entscheidungen weiterhin in sterreich getroffen werden und ein neuer partner auf der osteuropa kompetenz der austrian in kooperation mit dem flughafen wien aufbaut statt die verkehre auf hubs ins benachbarte ausland umzuleiten denn der focus east ist nach wie vor das kerngesch ft der austrian das im internationalen wettbewerb unter neuer strategischer ausrichtung noch weiter ausbauf hig ist
1608705 das projekt hat allen betrieben direkt einen positiven wirtschaftlichen impuls gegeben die kompetenzplattform die zurzeit gerade aufgebaut wird st rkt dar ber hinaus die gesamte branche und schafft ein neues st rkefeld f r n
1608706 der vorschlag von justizministerin maria berger die im september drohenden mieterh hungen zu verhindern hat meine volle unterst tzung v llig unverst ndlich ist die haltung der vp die wie gewohnt blockiert und damit zulassen will dass bei den von der t glichen teuerungswelle geplagten menschen erneut abkassiert wird denn der index von dem die mieterh hungen abh ngen wird in erster linie von den hohen lebensmittel und treibstoffpreisen dominiert da zahlen die menschen ohnehin schon viel zu viel es ist absolut nicht einzusehen dass sie jetzt doppelt zur kasse gebeten werden
1608707 bei tagt glich neuen preisschocks und hohen inflationsraten ist es den menschen einfach nicht mehr zuzumuten dass ihnen jetzt eine weitere schmerzhafte erh hung aufgebrummt wird wie es geht zeigt die stadt linz vor sie hat die stadteigene gwg bereits angewiesen die heurigen erh hungen auszusetzen
1608708 jetzt gilt es vielmehr mit einer ausreichenden lohnrunde und angemessenen pensionserh hungen zumindest die h rtesten auswirkungen der preislawine bei lebensmitteln und energie abzumildern da kann man nicht auch noch beim wohnen verst rkt abkassieren betroffen w ren vor allen einkommensschwache familien denen die mietkosten heute schon bis zu 40 prozent vom monatseinkommen wegfressen

1608715 zahlreiche internationale unternehmen aus dem westen geben in china viel geld f r traditionelle werbung aus

1608718 der vorsto von justizministerin berger zur verhinderung der erh hung der kategoriemieten ist leider nicht ernst zu nehmen der zeitpunkt zum handeln wurde verschlafen alles was jetzt kommt ist wahlkampf
1608719 statt wahlkampf populismus muss nach den wahlen eine umfassende reform ausgearbeitet werden die den rasanten anstieg der mieten und betriebskosten stoppt
1608720 justizministerin berger hat damals keinen handlungsbedarf gesehen offensichtlich haben erst die bevorstehenden nationalratswahlen einen umdenkprozess bewirkt

1608724 nicht nur nationalstaaten verfolgen ihre konomischen und geopolitischen interessen in form von milit rischen interventionen auch und vor allem f r private firmen von sicherheits bis zu infrastruktur und r stungsunternehmen stellen kriege ein sonst kaum zu erreichendes gesch ft dar
1608725 2007 wurden weltweit 1 34 billionen dollar f r r stung ausgegeben die usa wendeten mit 547 milliarden dollar mehr geld f r r stungsprojekte auf als in jedem anderen jahr seit dem ende des zweiten weltkrieges
1608726 trotz vielseitiger appelle zur atomaren abr stung war die gefahr eines atomkrieges laut expertinnen noch nie so hoch wie heute die gro m chte allen voran die usa verf gen ber ein riesiges depot an atomaren vernichtungswaffen
1608727 und der hiroshima tag ist anlass sich mit jenen kriegen auseinanderzusetzen die gemeinhin als vergessene kriege bezeichnet werden jene kriege und bewaffnete konflikte also die ohne die aufmerksamkeit der westlichen ffentlichkeit zigtausende menschenleben fordern
1608728 er ist aktuelle mahnung sich f r eine welt ohne atomwaffen und krieg einzusetzen und er ist mahnung die gesellschaftlichen verh ltnisse die kriege hervorrufen grunds tzlich in frage zu stellen und f r deren ver nderung zu k mpfen nie wieder krieg

1608807 since coming to the games as a little kid ive wanted to play here grymes said
1608808 he s got a real love for the game said west seattle coach
1608809 he works hard and he s also a good student
1608810 we always like to look at the strongest players we have in a system and feature them and bring out their strengths because its more mental pressure to the opponent he said
1608811 but since ive been coaching weve had setbacks all the time right now its like hes sprained his ankle and he cant play
1608812 everybody thought he was the greatest thing theyd ever had then he decided not to play football and they said oh no we cant line up without this guy and they had this tall skinny guy take his place 208 pounds his name was
1608813 so we are looking at it as an opportunity to develop depth and if he makes it back we will have those things ready for him if not we will go another direction
1608814 well give all the means of support if you choose it turkish cypriots are facing unfair economic isolation
1608815 there was a fire in a small office on the second floor of the building but it was quickly extinguished
1608816 apparently after any visit of iranian officials to different countries the issue of mediation is raised but these statements are wrong
1608817 naturally several issues one of them being the nuclear issue are raised in diplomatic talks
1608818 erdo an invited him assad and they have issues to discuss such as peace talks
1608819 in the 1980s i was against turkeys full membership however when i took over my post turkey changed dramatically
1608820 there are factions both in europe and turkey that are determined to impede the process it can be real difficult to run this boat when obstacles come from both sides
1608821 therefore the determination of the negotiation timeline came as a surprise to these circles
1608822 i think europeans biggest mistake is their cyprus policy i also think that greek cyprus eu membership before a settlement was reached was a big mistake
1608823 turkey cannot be a player by itself against china or the u s
1608824 the timeline previously set by the president is very realistic
1608825 it is apparent that turkey brings forth several preconditions for normalizing relations with armenia and these preconditions include the withdrawal of armenian troops from mountainous nagorno karabagh and armenias rejection of the policy of genocide recognition but it is clear that armenia cannot meet these preconditions
1608826 this results in armenias formal view that mutual relations with turkey must be established without any preconditions
1608827 armenias newly elected president serge sarkisians invitation has caused broad discussions also in armenia
1608828 but considering the fact that armenia still is under the post election crisis which followed this years presidential elections and that this situation influences the foreign policy of armenias leadership it is fairly difficult to predict how beneficial this invitation will be for bettering armenian turkish relations and to know sarkisians true motives behind this invitation
1608829 a new phase of dialogue with the government and people of turkey
1608830 a large majority 76 percent believed relations with turkey must be established but without forgetting the past or the recognition of the genocide while the other group was completely against the establishment of any relations
1608831 the problem seems irresolvable a meeting between the presidents of the two countries or the discussions to that effect at the very least makes the examining of potential resources for partnership become an order of the day
1608832 however i have never succeeded being a guest of my president in my own country for five and a half years i wish we could have had a dinner together with our families i would prefer to have talked about national problems in a cozy atmosphere
1608833 i like taking advice i respect each opinion coming from the bottom to the top of my party in those days mr g l and i were the key figures in all the advisories and the opinion surveys
1608834 please imagine yourself in my position i am a politician if i dont follow this path how can i guarantee my future as a politician there was an alliance for both my candidacy and that of mr g l
1608835 this is out of the question mr g l is an internationally well known figure he has acquired a wide range of experience at the foreign ministry
1608836 turkeys progress in infant mortality rates is not so promising despite a decrease in recent years
1608837 the infant mortality rates are even higher in the east and rural areas the economic development level of turkey remains among the highest in the world while the infant mortality rates are high a striking contrast
1608838 all these are part of a chain to reduce the high figures and organization in all these fields is better in the west

1608841 considering the enormity of the army its very interesting for the supreme military council ya not to discuss a single dossier of anti secular activities i think there is a very warm relationship between the government and the chief of general staff
1608842 there are reports in the media on certain negotiations between the government and the military and furthermore some web sites argue that the president threatened not to approve ya decisions if it contained dismissals
1608843 this change in the program suits the justice and development partys targets and background very well

1608845 they enter the banned area and have picnics despite the ban women with headscarves go swimming in the banned area without anyone stopping them

1608865 its a mistake to say the story of russian dissidents is over
1608866 its a good thing for solzhenitsyn that hes not living in china right now
1608867 there was a moment when the public opinion of the greatest empire in the world involved in the largest war in their history was changed by a few poets
1608868 and solzhenitsyn changed the story of the story of the soviet union he changed it from this difficult march to utopia to the decline of a brutal totalitarian state and his version of the soviet union lived longer than the official account that is a kind of social and cultural power that is special to writers
1608869 we file a suit but the main firm easily manages to escape the sub contracting firm is punished
1608870 the songs that i write are in the core of the band
1608871 so i can say that i am strict about the participation of other musicians on songs i must admit that i take it like a solo record i find the singers i bring the bass player
1608872 your job is not that hard if you are working with a singer like antony
1608873 you tell him what you want and he comfortably does just that
1608874 i think he likes to explore newer vocal ranges he works enthusiastically so it was easy to record with him
1608875 i believe that will create more possibilities in our music
1608876 the vehicle went off the edge of the road and flipped several times
1608877 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery

1608879 im vanessa from m xico city since i come from a big city being in another city where there are lots of museums and things to do is amazing ive been learning more about myself and growing up ive met really interesting people mostly other foreigners living here has been pretty hard because i dont speak turkish but i try my best to talk and order my food and pay but there is always somebody in the shop or restaurant that speaks english so often i cant practice the few words that i know for me the most enjoyable thing about being here is the people i love the hospitality in the towns and the honest kindness of many people there are also the beautiful landscapes ive been in some places in turkey where i cant stop taking pictures and looking all around turkey is a place to see definitely what i dont like i am not sure why but i feel that turkish men cant have female friends i think they dont believe in this kind of friendship also we cant see some video web sites here its quite annoying because they are useful for teaching ive been happy here ive tried to fit into the society and understand the people i love the views and the people but i find it difficult to make friends because of a difference between my culture and theirs
1608880 memet you are too young memet forgive yourself forgive us forgive the world
1608881 there seems to be a little respite for the service sector with the overall business activity index bouncing back unexpectedly
1608882 but it remains in weak territory and certainly in our view does not mark a turning point in the sectors fortunes
1608883 while services activity fell at a slower rate during july the risks to future trends in the sector remained clearly skewed to the downside
1608884 the record contraction in new business severe cost pressures and deteriorating sentiment all point to the continuation of difficult times ahead
1608885 this bowl i would give 85 points out of 100
1608886 the auction houses and buyers often cant tell the difference
1608887 a large number of fakes are finding their way into auctions everywhere
1608888 in france one of the areas where this has really hit the business theres a laundering of these fake ceramics because traditionally france has always had a large number of private collections and in the old days that was where all the great finds and discoveries were made
1608889 it has spoilt the whole industry because people have no confidence
1608890 although the uncertainty was removed by the verdict this is a temporary relief
1608891 in order to establish a permanent stability economic reforms are crucial
1608892 in order to render fdi permanent establishing an anchor through a deal with the international monetary fund would be welcomed by global markets
1608893 the verdict of the constitutional court is important in terms of enabling investors to establish forecasts but it alone will be enough for a short term
1608894 turkey should get back to its economy policies such as economy management reforms and monetary and fiscal policies
1608895 while fdi has a key importance in financing the current account deficit the united states based credit crunch dating back to the middle of last year has reduced fdi inflow
1608896 in order to attract foreign investors again establishing confidence in the economy is crucial in this context constituting an imf anchor will strengthen investor confidence and will support capital inflows

1608903 wood and steel yacht construction is also ongoing at our zone luxurious yacht production which started with the yacht production firm notika has taken a significant distance in eight years
1608904 there is an intense demand to produce yachts in the antalya free zone however we are unable to give hopes to investors due to lack of sufficient space the land behind the antalya free zone should be transferred to the zone after the houses there are nationalized and collapsed
1608905 annual yacht production capacity of the zone reached 50 to 60 units yacht production capacity is rapidly increasing in our free zone antalya has started to become a brand in luxurious yacht production now
1608906 despite the slowdown in global growth and the increase in fares designed to absorb a part of the rise in oil prices the passenger activity achieved a 3 7 percent rise in traffic and a high load factor of 80 3 percent premium traffic remains dynamic
1608907 we believe that the houses in our project will satisfy the differing expectations of the customers we have put the houses in our project up for sale at prices ranging from ytl 3 000 to ytl 3 750

1608927 la buena noticia es que podemos mejorar la salud creo que eso es m s importante que extender la vida

1608937 impulsar un nuevo acuerdo para que los valores por caja sean superiores
1608938 en el tema vinos hay un avance de una gran complementariedad de los sectores privados porque se est n realizando conversaciones que implicar an la participaci n con apoyo t cnico y estructural de parte de los sectores productores de vino argentino con sus pares brasile os
1608939 otro tema de consulta por parte de la delegaci n brasile a fue el del trigo y la delegaci n de la secretar a de agricultura ganader a pesca y alimentos confirm que en este momento est abierto el registro para anotar hasta 902 mil toneladas y se est analizando la posibilidad de que en los pr ximos meses aparezca otro cupo adicional de alrededor de otras 500 mil toneladas y as sucesivamente a medida en que los productores van informando disponibilidad

1608944 there can therefore be little doubt that the construction sector is now firmly in recession
1608945 the sector looks to be in for an extended very difficult time this reinforces our belief that the overall economy is more likely than not to contract in the second half of 2008
1608946 the perception the global economy is slowing is damping demand said park sehick a fund manager at hanwha investment trust management in seoul which manages the equivalent of 1 billion in equities
1608947 increasingly concerned about the outlook for global growth darren gibbs chief economist at deutsche bank in auckland said in a report today
1608948 speculation had been driving these markets and they were due for a correction as so many prices had gotten overdone said peter sorrentino who helps manage 16
1608949 there are moderating growth expectations that are going to hurt industrial commodities going forward you have to be very selective
1608950 we are even more confident that the turkish central bank will keep rates on hold yarkin cebeci an economist at jpmorgan chase amp co in istanbul said in a note to investors
1608951 the bank is not concerned about the rise in inflation in july
1608952 inflation may enter a trend of measured slowing if oil prices continue to follow a more positive path than base case scenarios the bank said
1608953 remains challenging due to food and energy and a probable rise in service he said
1608954 this strong result has been realized on the back of strong revenue growth of 39 percent controlled growth of cost of 26 percent and effective risk management despite a more challenging environment
1608955 this market will continue to grow russia will become turkeys largest market in tourism by the end of 2010 the number of those arriving from russia and cis will surpass germans
1608956 cost and profit balance is important consolidation will be ongoing in the upcoming period despite noteworthy package sales and number of passengers profitability is low
1608957 the acquisition of ger is critical and should be monitored however turkeys growth in russia will be ongoing
1608958 we have a five year strategic investment plan we expect the turkish subsidiaries to grow increasingly in terms of product portfolio turnover and operating results we aim to rank among the largest 20 pharmaceutical companies in turkeys market by 2013
1608959 daiichi sankyo constantly develops projects to purchase proper companies or license more products we are working on the near future projects regarding field activities in turkey however we are unable to make statement on the issue at present
1608960 im 12 years old and i already know what sadness is
1608961 it pays politically to say lets get rid of the roma not only in italy but in europe in general
1608962 there need to be policies that promote cultural integration that insert children into the educational system and put families in homes
1608963 criminality doesnt have any kind of connection to race and ethnicity
1608964 the most discriminated people living in europe are romany people and the situation in italy is the worst ive seen
1608965 took a census of the jews in 1938 and that was the beginning of a process that put me and my family in auschwitz five years later
1608966 launching the change in credit cards as well as the corporate image we have chosen worldcard to cooperate with due to its brand recognition and company network in order to raise our quality of service
1608967 we aim to double our turnover and the company network members within two years through providing innovative products and services via the advantages of the worldcard
1608968 considering competition in the sector the strength of the existing brands and the required amount of investment we decided to cooperate with worldcard which is one of the strongest players of the market instead of enlarging our member company network
1608969 thus we will be able to use the financial source which could have been allocated for the new investment for providing better service quality
1608970 raise a number of issues such as the permanent status issues checkpoints and prisoners
1608971 we decided and promised to make all the efforts to reach the peace treaty until the end of the year we are making all the effort to do so
1608972 but what is more important is now the understanding between israelis and the palestinians that we are on the right track the timeline is less important
1608973 the fire is spreading though about 150 hectares 371 acres of forest though not all of them have been burned down
1608974 the message delivered today tuesday is not irans response to the six countries
1608975 what was given to solana was the telephone conversation transcript and not a response to the proposed package
1608976 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1608977 in the absence of a positive response we have no choice but to pursue further measures
1608978 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1608979 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1608980 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1608981 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1608982 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1608983 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1608984 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1608985 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1608986 security for the olympic games is of paramount importance the more we give the safer and more secure the residents will feel
1608987 we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away
1608988 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to meet the challenges we face or isnt giving the american people straight talk
1608989 if senator mccain is willing to pass a compromise that provides immediate relief to consumers in the form of a 1 000 energy rebate and makes a serious investment in renewable energy senator obama would be happy to join him in calling on congress to return
1608990 but if he continues to reject any compromise that takes away tax breaks for the same oil companies that have given millions to his campaign wed rather not waste the american peoples tax dollars
1608991 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1608992 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power
1608993 the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea two months ago is a slide in his poll numbers
1608994 after the long talks we held it was clear for us that what happened on july 22 was a big conspiracy and very dangerous for the democratic and constitutional process of iraq in particular against the kurds
1608995 i believe this new proposal will be agreed by all the parties because we have reached a dead end and there must be a new solution
1608996 were very proud of the work our news and design staff put into the boston herald every day and are pleased to see it recognized in these awards

1609007 please dont write against the koran course our girls did not die naked on the beaches they did not die because they were electrocuted by a faulty machine at a foam party in a luxury hotel they did not involve in any sinful event they woke up performed ablution and got ready for prayers and died while performing prayers or as they were about to start prayers thats the will of the god they have become martyrs we do not have complaint against anyone
1609008 i consider arguments including little details such as format and location of the visit inappropriate in such an important period and before an important visit i think we should focus on the core of the visit
1609009 i acted with the responsibility of a husband and father i drove my wife and child to the family of my wife in zmir
1609010 in a way that the constitutional courts decision to keep the campus ban on the turban in effect may be good news for the akp contrary to what many people predict the ruling may not have boosted the chances of a political ban for the akp and its politburo but may actually have reduced it legally speaking the turban verdict in theory should strengthen the indictment that might be true if the entire legal deliberation was legal only as the turban ruling shows the supreme judges tend to make political considerations too
1609011 that being the situation is it too unlikely if the court went for a third way in the twin disputes of the turban and the closure case a third way that might avoid two extremes endorsing the turban and not banning the akp vs banning both the turban and the akp in the hope of a not causing too many storms on either part of the ideological green line and being responsible for whatever international disasters for turkey that may follow and b taming the akp and discouraging it from following an islamic agenda that thinking may result in a minor punishment for the akp not closure and political bans for its leadership
1609012 we believe the akp should take the necessary messages from this verdict
1609013 the guilty will be put behind bars if he re offends
1609014 i am powerful i am a beautiful independently wealthy woman
1609015 we must take the necessary steps to build out network capacity or potentially face internet gridlock that could wreak havoc on internet services
1609016 as you know the ergenekon is the enemy of the u s isnt it most likely that they are behind this attack
1609017 i am confident that the air quality will not pose major problems to athletes and visitors here
1609018 it is hourly data and we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may take some action
1609019 those standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does
1609020 the misty air is not a feature of pollution but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1609021 there wont be problems for someone who lives in sao paulo like me
1609022 beijing is not worse than the city i live in im not worried
1609023 and we will have to walk around with masks if it gets too polluted
1609024 i could not foresee collecting such a big amount of aid this shows how charitable our people are
1609025 our security forces have done great damage to the armed members of the terror organization till now then how does it happen that the terror organization still exists the answer to this question is naturally very complicated today however i will mention only two fundamental reasons for this continued existence the first is the failure to completely prevent new adherents from joining this organization that duty befalls all state institutes and institutions if new members keep joining the organization as security forces put others out of action the fight against terror will take much longer than planned one of the biggest mistakes that were made each time there was a decrease in terror was to assume that the terror organization was finished of course another important reason is the absence of a professional structure that will enable the state to deliver a parallel concurrent and effective fight against terror in the economic socio cultural and psychological areas as well as that of security
1609026 we needed to set the tone we run a business like practice everybody is treated the same here it doesnt matter if youre an all american quarterback or an all american linebacker or the last string kicker or last string receiver youll be treated the same
1609027 we have no stars we just have a bunch of guys who are going to represent hawaii and the university of hawaii the right way
1609028 at the end of the first practice of training camp yesterday soares the no 1 left side linebacker was ordered to roll the length of the field twice as punishment for failing to meet a team requirement

1609030 its a little more uptempo were moving around all of the time its going to be good for the team were going to be conditioned and ready to go when we go down to florida for the aug 30 season opener
1609031 unlike the previous nine training camps under june jones now head coach of southern methodist yesterdays practice was a vision of perpetual motion the rapid fire reps were a rude awakening for day dreamers
1609032 if you go on the field youre learning theyre all getting repetitions theyre not standing around listening to someone orate
1609033 mcmackin to be sure was mindful of the heat during the late morning practice
1609034 he is a nice guy but this is time to get down and get to business we need to do the things we need to do and discipline is very important
1609035 make that discipline and adaptability the concept of sudden change was a point of emphasis yesterday and will be throughout camp and the season it means at anytime during practice the entire team may be assembled for as monty python used to say something completely different like basketball style suicide sprints which mcmackin believes are of more value than the 220 yard conditioning test jones preferred to mack furlongs are for horses
1609036 you dont know when that horns going to go off youve got to be ready to go run those sprints come back and do drills again
1609037 different situations in the game all of a sudden turnovers fumble interception boom be ready to go
1609038 were doing a lot of things we did last year and a lot of different things the main thing is to get these guys ready to play
1609039 balls were thrown good guys were catching the football i think were ahead of where we thought wed be
1609040 im going to keep the same plan that we had were looking at the jc guys well make a decision in two weeks and all three of them are going to get reps its just cut down by one so theyre going to get more reps
1609041 it was very effective running from what i heard it seems like were going to be running like that throughout camp not just the 220 test and then kind of ease off its good even though i complained during the running i know its good for us
1609042 oh man its tough theyve got us doing crunches while rolovich is asking us about our reads youre trying to think about the play but what youve got in your mind is how painful it is and how you want to put your leg down
1609043 ive never been in the military but it reminds me of those movies when someone has to do pushups while being yelled at
1609044 he said giving a pop quiz mirrors game conditions in which quarterbacks need to be alert despite fatigue and physical discomfort
1609045 alexander and rausch said they are adjusting to the accelerated pace of division i a football particularly in deciphering defensive coverages
1609046 its just the nuances of the offense knowing what the receivers splits have to be just being exactly on the same page with everybody its a half second difference between throwing it behind a guy or throwing it for a touchdown
1609047 both of the new guys really put in a lot of hard work in the summer along with inoke so theyre further ahead than they would be just coming out blindly they both do some nice things
1609048 they have really strong arms and they have what you cant teach height theyre both really cool humble guys very teachable always willing to learn
1609049 we didnt know if he would be in camp it was going to depend on if they had room i was home for three weeks but i wanted to come back early and talk to coach and see if i could get into camp
1609050 since ive been here i was always looking to colt or looking to tyler now im the most experienced here so definitely i have more responsibility now
1609051 i feel a lot better than i ever have coming into fall camp i was told it looked like i was more energized i wasnt thinking about it but i feel like its because coaches have shown confidence in me im the one the offense is looking at and how do you think theyll feel if they look at me and my knees are shaking and super scared so its contagious
1609052 he is very mild mannered there are a lot of the local boy traits in him for the first few years he was here he didnt want to step on anybodys toes but out here now at this position he knows what is expected of him and he has a fire within him
1609053 hes prepared himself for this and we have full confidence in his abilities to get the job done
1609054 i hope he takes care of what he has to take care of but until hes here were moving on
1609055 thats one spot that was unsettled from spring i thought kia did a good job during spring but thats the one spot where we really want competition thats one spot where theres the least experience so thats where we want to create the most competition as someone really earns that spot well spread the other two out
1609056 the position was vacated after 2007 starter keith ahsoon was moved to left guard kia received the most reps during spring ball while letuli recovered from a hamstring injury which he said was up to 95 percent healed
1609057 as far as practice today i was a little rusty because i missed all of spring
1609058 i think i did all right it was more mental than i thought it would be because of the heat the heat makes the helmet an oven so it made it tough to remember your plays and assignments other than that i think i did pretty good today this is how its going to be in florida but worse
1609059 laupepa is smart and ray is smart and theyll learn fast they are all three going to get a lot of reps in the first couple of weeks before we make a decision and start seeing if we have to move guys to other spots
1609060 i think coming from where i have i progressed a lot theres definitely a lot more room for improvement but its something im going to work on during the season and during camp competition is really thick aaron is a utility guy he knows all the positions pepa is a utility guy he knows all the positions they are both great technicians and great athletes
1609061 like last summer i decided to stay in hawaii instead of go home i went to all the morning workouts and morning running and i went on a diet to lose weight nothing right now is set in stone but i did all right i knew my plays the running could have been better but im not going to make any excuses
1609062 i think we can get them in shape and get them ready
1609063 both tackles are important because were a half roll team so if they are rolling right they are rolling away from the left tackle and hes got a little more time to work so i think both tackles here are equally important
1609064 it doesnt matter if youre first second third were all going to improve its great i think were the best players to play that spot because were mobile and athletic and technique wise were all legit
1609065 the announcement was made during an emotional team meeting sunday night maka received a standing ovation
1609066 im proud of him im glad he can help us and im glad he will graduate
1609067 maka is a math major who is on track to earn a bachelors degree in december
1609068 they need some speed guys over there and im speedy might as well put me over there
1609069 the sun made me do the hair its going to be pretty hot out here
1609070 im up for the challenge anything i can do to help the team out im willing to do hopefully good things will come out of it
1609071 i like that hes 6 1 210 pounds runs 4 5 seconds over 40 yards and will hit you like everything else youve got to start somewhere after spring he was the guy
1609072 thats a competitive battle thats probably going to go down to the wire
1609073 silva displayed his quickness during yesterdays ladder drill in which players had to run sprints of 10 20 30 and 40 yards silva finished first
1609074 i played the back nine i was 44 over its fun
1609075 my friend used to call me detour because i used to always run out of bounds detour to the sidelines
1609076 im still a walk on its up to the coaches if im worthy of a scholarship
1609077 it was tough ive got to get back in shape
1609078 after spending a year in corvallis ore the 6 foot 1 205 pound silva returned home to be closer to family he sat out the entire 07 season but had a strong spring despite the long layoff
1609079 it was kind of humbling when i saw my name on the depth chart at no 1 coming out of spring i was the first but i wasnt sure if they would still have me there shows that the coaches got trust in me
1609080 we dont run at oregon state coach had a philosophy where we get ready at practice by going full speed
1609081 over here were fighting goliath when we go to florida weve got to be ready
1609082 we got florida first the big sec i always get up for everything
1609083 its a good feeling its like i worked this hard and its paid off but i just have to keep working i dont want to be satisfied with what ive got
1609084 i just like being part of the team again more than anything i battled through it i got it all fixed up and im excited to be back its my first practice in eight months
1609085 i feel if youre going to play outside you have to be fast and thats something i definitely feel i can bring to this team is speed i feel confident about that
1609086 how come hes moved 5 when ive only moved one

1609090 if youre having fun with your baby shes having fun if you create what i call a connected childhood that is by far the best step to guarantee your child will be happy
1609091 he loves to build things and to help his dad build special projects it makes him feel good about himself we try to help him focus on what he has a natural talent for where we can tell hes really having fun
1609092 parents try to make it better for their children all the time to make them happy all the time thats not realistic dont always jump in and try to fix it
1609093 children need to learn to tolerate some distress some unhappiness let them struggle figure out things on their own because it allows them to learn how to cope
1609094 among all my friends thats what we want to know
1609095 a sensitive mother can pick up on different kinds of cries and facial expressions
1609096 the eyebrows the mouth and vocalizations are all signaling systems for the baby
1609097 the child will show signs of distress if that noise or light continues to increase the feeling turns to anger
1609098 theyre content or not content based on something in their immediate environment
1609099 its normal for kids to become oversensitive or clingy or nervous at times because of something in their environment but its not unhappiness
1609100 some parents worry any time their children suffer a little rejection they dont get invited to the birthday party or they cry because they didnt get what they wanted
1609101 parents who tend to be depressed are often not good at being consistent with their discipline and providing structure or at providing consistent praise and having fun with their children all of this can contribute to emotional problems
1609102 the helicopters are unsuitable for rescue work as they are too heavy many manoeuvres cannot be performed with them
1609103 with the change in the helicopters not only a rescue squadron is to be eliminated but ten years of training are to be thrown away besides lot of money is to be squandered
1609104 the pilots training is specific making a transport pilot from a rescue pilot is like making a general practitioner from a surgeon
1609105 apparently the generals promise something and insist on their plans irrespective of the risks involved

1609119 as a team we adapted to that tempo and we will pose problems to our opposition if we continue like that
1609120 we train too hard but the drills make us dynamic
1609121 we dont stop even for a second and it will help us a lot

1609127 the tourists who come to our country on all inclusive holidays are not aware of any of the beauties in our country they travel only between the airport and the hotel they enjoy only the sea sand and sun our lands possess the historical richness of all the civilizations that have passed through this must be promoted this project will highlight the historical culture in our area which is the meandros basin
1609128 this project will revive the aegean the waters of meander will revive the aegean
1609129 of the surveyed countries czechs complained the most of the traffic in their towns
1609130 the hybrid rebate program reflects envistas continued commitment to the environment and offers our team members a way to make a difference while cutting down on their transportation costs
1609131 just as our company helps clients eliminate waste and improve efficiencies across their enterprise we value the importance of doing the same for our environment
1609132 rising fuel prices are causing people to look for alternatives to lengthy commutes and working from home or at locations closer to home are attractive options
1609133 technology has also made it easier for employees to work remotely when traveling for business
1609134 for professionals whose jobs require a great deal of face time with colleagues or customers working remotely might not be practical
1609135 we will start trial runs with two wagons as of dec 31 we are quite assertive in this project
1609136 our citizens craftsmen and shop owners are having difficulty during the construction works going on at different points of the city however we do our best to shorten this period and keep the difficulties to a minimum level

1609138 the experts continue giving advice regarding the welding process which i believe will facilitate our friends to complete the rail line works in the shortest possible time without leading to further delays
1609139 so we have launched an endeavor to restore this historical and architectural structure
1609140 projects prepared by our municipality have been approved by the ayd n cultural and natural heritage protection committees meeting held on july 7 now a committee from the ministry of culture and tourism will assess the restitution and restoration projects when this process is completed restoration will be launched and pigeon island will regain its former identity as a historical and cultural wonder
1609141 it was such a terrible fire that we barely saved our lives but lost all our animals the basic means of our living
1609142 the municipality gave us a tent where we live now we have nothing except this tent
1609143 i saw the smoke on my way to the village
1609144 there were some people from the forestry directorate at the entrance of the village and they did not let us enter the village however i managed to escape from their sight and rescued our animals by dragging them to the nearby village along the water canal
1609145 yes it is true that the firefighters were here but they just watched how our houses were being eaten up by the fires
1609146 they said that they could not step in unless they were given the legal permission when they got it it was too late as you see around
1609147 after we lost everything the vehicles began operating it was in vain so we threw stones at them to send them away they have nothing left to do in our village
1609148 the fire teams and vehicles sent here were not organized enough
1609149 i saved my house myself with 400 liters of water carried by my tractor while the fire teams were watching me
1609150 the fire teams did not intervene at the right time if they had everything could have been different now
1609151 we have never had a doctor or any other medical staff in our village so far although we had the building
1609152 but now they have sent a doctor here just because the prime minister will come
1609153 they could have been saved if we had what a medical center should have
1609154 the fire died down by itself at the end of four days
1609155 it was not extinguished by the fire teams or vehicles
1609156 i suggested mediterranean countries to set up a mutual fleet to fight against forest fires our interviews on the subject still continue
1609157 since the seasons in northern and southern hemispheres arent parallel countries of the northern and southern hemispheres may also cooperate with each other on the issue
1609158 we sympathize with turkey fighting bushfires is difficult and they can do terrible damage australia has similar difficulties
1609159 we will start our works to establish a national fire fleet soon
1609160 well not let anybody build up anything there and an area 42 times larger than the burned off zone will be reforested
1609161 last year a fire erupted in greece and i know that foresters deserted efforts to extinguish the fire
1609162 this is up to mr klaban it is an organisation standing close to social democracy
1609163 i do not doubt that he zeman would manage the presidential function
1609164 i would not go on hunger strike if he zeman were elected
1609165 a majority of the political spectrum agreed on his candidacy
1609166 nevertheless now and then there already exist or are emerging oases of intensive and radical spirituality such as the carmelitan sisters the trappist fathers and now also the trappist sisters

1609181 while those abba songs are still there they now have to fight for our attention against overstuffed production numbers that wear us out rather than entertain
1609182 that cheesy abba musical has now become an even cheesier film
1609183 mamma mia is one bitch of a kitsch but its irresistible
1609184 with its frenetic pace and its many concessions to blockbuster formula the dark knight is by no means a complete success but the more it reveals its dark heart the better it gets and at times it seems just a step away from achieving something extraordinary in the end its no leap forward but its certainly a step in the right direction an action blockbuster extravaganza thats sadder than sad and never pretends otherwise
1609185 some of the special effects are disgusting and disturbing enough to justify something more severe than the pg 13 rating this movie is certainly not for children nor for anyone whos afraid of clowns
1609186 how does halo 3 keep bouncing back to top the charts once again
1609187 this wont be simply a matter of drought busters driving around the city trying to monitor behavior

1609194 its not just going to affect poor people but also moderate to middle class households people are going to become more impoverished to pay for heating this winter
1609195 we are trying to avoid having angry customers having angry customers before the start of winter well thats not good business
1609196 this is going to have a huge impact it will start to pinch people in september and october and could influence this falls elections remember it is much easier for people to drive less than it is to heat less
1609197 the deteriorating demand picture reinforces our belief that oil prices are approaching a tipping point

1609237 the resignations are under the active consideration of the governor
1609238 some days ago the three of them came to me and asked me to resign they were very angry and told me that some of my remarks had upset their political partners i told them that prime minister dr manmohan singh as a sikh has done the nation proud if that has upset their political partners then i dont have anything to say i would say the same about dr singh again he is honest and a true sikh
1609239 the moment they got the letter they left appointments are done and cancelled i have no quarrels but i was pained at the manner in which it was carried out
1609240 we are willing to distribute copies of the resignation letter to the media to prove that it was written in his own handw
1609241 i never made such statements you can browse newspapers in the us during that period what i said was that wherever the sikhs go they carve out a separate state for themselves and our homeland has no boundaries i still stand by that statement
1609242 india should also make some compromises at the nsg to ensure the consensus
1609243 as you know even at the iaea quite a number of countries besides pakistan and china had expressed reservations and so its going to be an uphill battle in the nsg to get the kind of clean exemption the us is trying to deliver
1609244 the state department made us fully aware of the challenges in the nsg and thats why we believe that india also has to make some small compromises and play ball to make this happen because even after it comes here the state department has a lot of work with the presidential certifications and drafts before the agreement is sent to congress and then of course there will be a series of hearings
1609245 its not an easy task at all its a tough road ahead particularly because of the logistics of the congressional calendar and the 30 day clause which by itself could result in the clock running out
1609246 weve stated often our support for this deal and the belief that its important not only for the bilateral relationship but also for nuclear security in the rest of the world
1609247 but now that the international atomic energy agency has voted were going to look to discuss this issue with the members of the nsg
1609248 were hoping to get a positive result out of that some time in the next
1609249 and then hopefully well be able to represent this to congress on september 8
1609250 were going to be working with our contacts on the hill to explain why we believe this is important and hopefully weve be able to have a positive outcome of this
1609251 in this particular case it is not so much the grassroots because we believe the votes are there the majorities are there in both the house and senate but it has much more to do with the leadership of the congress bringing it up for floor action so we are not so much concerned about the voting we know its there what we are concerned is if we can bring it to the floor on time in the very small window that is there in the congressional calendar
1609252 it is not easy because it is now a logistical issue and there is no guarantee that it can be moved in this congress and it could very well spill over to the next administration and congress no question about it there are absolutely no guarantees its going to be very very tough
1609253 if anybody predicts that this can happen definitely in this session and when exactly it will be taken up they are lying there are so many in between things which are unknown and different lawyers are looking at all of this and theres a lot of disagreements on the parliamentary procedures than can or cannot be used
1609254 its finally going to come down to the political will of the leadership
1609255 there is zero chance if there is no political will
1609256 what we are all doing right now is working very hard to try to generate that political will but its not very easy because right now with congress in recess its not on the radar and thats going to be the challenge getting it back on the radar
1609257 its highly unlikely that the senate foreign relations committee and the house foreign affairs committee is going to suspend the rules that exist in the hyde act for consideration of the 123 agreement which must lie on the table for 30 days and then the two committees should hold hearings on the agreement and that could take quite a long time
1609258 it is sometimes tough for congress to focus on things that are not directly before them and so until the 123 agreement comes to the hill its not entirely clear to me that theyve gone though each and every aspect of the 123 agreement or the safeguards agreement thats going to come later

1609288 as im sure that you are aware there are guidelines that have been put in place for international media coming to beijing china in 2008 and there are politically sensitive topics that the government has asked the foreign media not to cover
1609289 is a company that has as its majority shareholder as the beijing government
1609290 relies on the support and assistance of many chinese government departments
1609291 if bmc was seen to be supporting an international programme whose intentions were to cover any of the 5 forbidden topics the repercussions for bmc and its clients could be disastrous for the olympic project and any further support for the remaining 26 years of the joint venture
1609292 should you be coming to beijing to cover olympic related topics then we would be only too happy to assist you with your requirements but should you be coming to beijing to produce segments and stories on any of the forbidden topics then im sorry but we are not going to be able to offer our support this time around
1609293 we are purely in a partnership as a facilities provider and facilitator in china
1609294 we can only reiterate that we dont know the five forbidden topics i suspect we didnt know them when the e mail was sent five months ago and we still dont know
1609295 our broadcast base here is an independent broadcast base we dont provide any assistance on what stories you might want to cover its up to the journalists themselves
1609296 that the reporting regulations issued in 2007 for all foreign journalists coming to report on the games expressly allowed freedom for foreign journalists to report on any matters they saw as necessary to be reported on
1609297 this suggestion against covering sensitive topics does fly in the face of those policies that the chinese government has been making in fact right back to when the olympic games were granted in 2001 the secretary general of the beijing olympic bid committee wang wei said we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
1609298 despite the introduction of new media regulations increasing the freedom of foreign reporters to cover news stories in china
1609299 concerns remain that authorities may seek to block broadcasting of anything deemed sensitive or inappropriate during the olympic games
1609300 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1609301 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1609302 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1609303 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1609304 tens of thousands of dollars at a time from atms
1609305 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1609306 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1609307 philip and leona have a dinner booked in later this month

1609309 the reason lewis doesnt wear diamonds is because she doesnt know how they have been sourced it was for this reason that she is determined to set up her own ethical fashion range and sell the goods at high street prices

1609319 heres what ive decided the very least you can do in your life is figure out what you hope for and the most you can do is live inside that hope not admire it from a distance but live right in it under its roof what i want is so simple i almost cant say it elementary kindness
1609320 grab your shoes your coat throw on some socks the eclipse the eclipse is tonight
1609321 i beg your pardon aint they one in the same
1609322 well time is going to pass whether you do something about it or not better to be doing something than to look back and wish you had
1609323 y know i was thinking maybe we should cut away another part of the yard yknow make that garden a little bigger this year
1609324 however we cannot control the economic environment in which we operate as a result of the recent slowdown in the television advertising market the board has taken some tough decisions
1609325 we can live with the impairment charge of 1 6 billion pounds its often very sensible to write off goodwill and there was plenty of it in the balance sheet
1609326 the fact remains that itv does not seem to have improved its program schedule perhaps this is an unfair indictment but the change is taking too long also the flagship itn news at ten program does not seem to have captured the imagination of viewers
1609327 the bid for lonmin is timely in terms of both lonmins operational performance and softening platinum group metal pgm markets which have allowed the bid to be pitched at a sensible level
1609328 the proposal will stir the interests of a number of potential suitors largely gold majors we suspect
1609329 the xstrata deal is a shot in the arm that the market has been waiting for

1609338 it is strange that someone has said there is systematic doping these situations are very unpleasant but to say it is systematic is premature
1609339 when in the united states they discovered the balco laboratories it was sad but they didnt say that the whole of us sport was involved in doping
1609340 this does seem to be an example of systematic planned doping and under the new wada code that would mean an expanded ban of four years
1609341 the federation have done a very good job in revealing a very bad doping story which is just frustrating to find
1609342 thoroughly pissed off with god who knows of our need for a break and our financial situation
1609343 i really hate this of course i hate it for baby because he is miserable and cant eat yummy things like scrambled eggs but i am having a pity party for myself too because i dont want to be that kind of mom i like to think of my parenting style as relaxed
1609344 take your potato and egg taco outside and eat your breakfast before you arrive next week
1609345 the visit has been cancelled but i cannot tell you immediately the reason for it
1609346 the cancellation of the china visit by president musharraf is an important development
1609347 given our special relationship and friendly ties with china it is unimaginable that a pakistani leader would cancel his visit and that too for a very important occasion for our ally
1609348 the two sides have agreed to draw up a joint charge sheet against the president on the basis of available evidence and ask him to defend himself before the parliament

1609353 i am not so sure hes capable of backing off
1609354 i think hes kind of got a mind set which i think is the best way to race for a championship to go after it every week we wouldnt want to have him do anything other than try to win every race
1609355 im not a happy person when im not running well
1609356 to facilitate the reconstitution of the shri amarnathji shrine board sasb the present members have tendered their resignations to governor n n vohra who is also the chairman of the shrine board
1609357 the resignations are under the active consideration of the governor
1609358 we will be directly recruiting about 60 per cent of field staff mainly at the level of police sub inspectors for intelligence gathering through state recruitment board
1609359 the direct recruitment for intelligence operations means these staff will be deputed for intelligence gathering only they cannot be transfered for policing duty
1609360 its a routine thing athletes undergo dope tests before any event its not about we as a country being shamed but the issue is that there is no question of protecting anyone who has erred
1609361 if you see the newspapers they say seven russian athletes have been withdrawn and many more such news items are there in print so the main thing is that we dont protect the guilty
1609362 the sports ministry had only said that there should be a fair selection trial for the athletes
1609363 with regards to the pakistani intelligence services i think thats been historically an issue in that country there are signs that it remains so and we our collect our two governments are working to deal with those problems
1609364 very very small numbers of us special forces are operating in a training capacity in pakistan not out on joint missions but on a fixed site training pakistani forces at the invitation of the pakistani government
1609365 we have seen and continue to see pakistani military operations in the fata and we are pleased to see that but this needs to be a concerted and consistent effort to go after the militants to prevent them from either creating training grounds and safe havens within pakistan or going into afghanistan and causing trouble there
1609366 so there clearly are increased military operations weve seen that we are pleased by it we need to continue to see it and we need to see probably even more robust efforts on the pakistans part
1609367 we apprehend that the revoked order might be amended during the all party meeting convened by the prime minister as a mark of protest against any such move i appeal to the people of kashmir to observe a complete strike
1609368 we want a peaceful bandh incidents of stone pelting giving a chance to the police to use force against the protesters should be avoided
1609369 for years the chinese government has tried to use the olympics to legitimise its illegal occupation of tibet
1609370 at this very moment tibetans are facing the most severe and violent repression they have seen in decades at the hands of the chinese government and we have taken non violent action at this critical time to draw the worlds attention to the crisis gripping tibet

1609389 we believe the seabird deaths the scientists recorded might be just the tip of the iceberg
1609390 it suggests that around 18 000 seabirds may be killed annually in this fishery alone
1609391 most mortality relates to the dumping of fishing waste behind the boat this attracts seabirds which can either hit the warp lines or become entangled in the nets
1609392 the impact of this one local fishery has very widespread geographical repercussions
1609393 potential mortality at this scale for the albatrosses is unsustainable
1609394 watching birds drown accidentally on the trawl warps is a very sad sight as these magnificent birds are just trying to feed themselves with no harm to any of us
1609395 one would hope that further data like these will now become available through appropriate collaborations involving fishery managers
1609396 and now mrs brown would you like to get your make up bag and weigh it in
1609397 at the same time we must ensure that all environmental and socioeconomic concerns are addressed in our analysis and this takes time
1609398 us demand wont recover soon tropical storm edouard should bring a short term support but demand outlook weighs on prices
1609399 slowing demand and the hope for more supply is weighing on the market even as the geopolitics and the weather is getting wild
1609400 this increased cost estimate is reasonable given inflation and the expected increase in the amount of spent nuclear fuel from existing reactors with license renewals
1609401 we have marked significant project milestones this year and look forward to nuclear waste currently sitting at 121 temporary locations around the country being safely stored at yucca mountain
1609402 often a catastrophic event like water dripping from the ceiling can launch home improvement projects into high gear but there is a lot you can do beyond fixing leaks and replacing worn exterior siding
1609403 a well designed exterior retrofit will lower energy bills and improve the comfort of your home by eliminating drafts
1609404 homes built 20 years ago are under insulated by todays standards since fuel was cheap then
1609405 builders of that time didnt devote much attention to insulation and air tightness high energy bills drafty indoor climates and ice dams on the roof are all costly symptoms of these subpar designs
1609406 at first this process may seem simple just strip off the old siding from the walls replace any failing trim and put up new siding
1609407 but this limited vision can lead to lost opportunities to increase the insulation in the walls
1609408 payback can be very hard to calculate since it depends on how much money is spent on improvements and a host of other factors including climate existing levels of insulation and fuel costs
1609409 calculations on savings for adding insulation to the walls of a standard ranch house predict a five to 10 year payback
1609410 nuances latest iteration of its pdf converter product takes aim at adobe acrobat by being cheaper faster and better
1609411 when it comes down to brass tacks nuance has done an admirable job at creating an affordable tool which should help to bring pdf creation to the masses and the product is well worth considering over adobes high end acrobat professional 8 1
1609412 packs in features that you wont find in adobes more expensive acrobat 8 standard
1609413 absolutely the best converter on the market excellent value for the money no other product comes close to the performance or the value
1609414 weve always liked the accuracy of omnipage and our testing of this latest version produced a 100 accuracy rate on the thirty some documents we scanned for this purpose it wins our editors choice award
1609415 omnipage blows me away the recognition accuracy is phenomenal it allows me to do things i have always wanted to do with ocr but couldnt before
1609416 over the years omnipage has literally saved me thousands of dollars and hours of time scanning and converting documents to editable text and the pdf format i would guess that using it saves me on average 8 to 10 hours a week and sometimes 2 to 3 hours a day
1609417 omnipage is really spot on omnipage significantly enhances the workflow process at my practice bringing cost effectiveness to the otherwise long and tedious document repurposing process
1609418 omnipage is now an integral part of my business activities i dont think i could function to such a high standard without the use of such a good document conversion and storage solution
1609419 omnipage is successful for me because of its accuracy if it wasnt accurate i would have to spend too much time correcting documents instead of working it saves me at least 15 minutes a page when i work on creating and editing new contracts

1609423 are these plants really going to be there when we need them
1609424 like most things in this world theyre all on collision courses
1609425 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1609426 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1609427 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1609428 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1609429 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1609430 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

1609436 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
1609437 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
1609438 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1609439 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1609440 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1609441 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
1609442 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

1609460 for the past 10 years the binkerts sausage platter has been a staple and a customer favorite and were out of sauerkraut too
1609461 the sausages were made traditionally and they were always very fresh they worked particularly well for what we are doing
1609462 binkerts impresses me because its a local family run business

1609467 we buy our meat deboned in 50 pound boxes if the animals are stressed when they are being transported the meat will be full of moisture and the sausages will turn out soggy we do not use that type of meat
1609468 the program was run wrong my staff should have caught it we were wrong
1609469 he loves his daughter kidnapping doesnt apply it was his own kid
1609470 criminals will no longer fear being executed in maryland no matter how heinous their crime
1609471 there is no question now about the innocence or guilt in this case
1609472 three separate baltimore city juries 12 members each men and women black and white have sentenced this man to death
1609473 consequently the defense never raised important facts like that hunt was high on pcp when the shooting occurred which might well have countered the prosecutors case that the murder was premeditated and thus death eligible
1609474 there will always be an error rate because this isnt a system thats run by infallible human beings and its impossible in the long run to run a system like this without making serious mistakes
1609475 adesso buzzanca deve ritirare quella generosissima convenzione fatta da genovese ai franza
1609476 sono venuti meno i presupposti che hanno portato lamministrazione allapprovazione dellaccordo con i franza per cui risulta necessario rivedere le posizioni assunte ponendo in essere tutte le iniziative possibili affinchp lamministrazione receda unilateralmente laccordo al fine di incentivare la rinascita del calcio a messina

1609480 we know so much more about our guys than we did a year ago
1609481 theres not as much competition as there was a year ago for the last spots and depth chart movement were in a different place than last year
1609482 ricky being banged up and not out here is a big reason for that
1609483 i think a lot of guys are getting their shot
1609484 i asked him tell me im wrong that youre playing again for all the right reasons
1609485 i thought he was extremely emotional last spring i thought his decision to un retire was emotional he told me that wasnt the case so i have to respect that
1609486 i never thought through this whole process that he was going to play this year if im wrong then im wrong
1609487 i just know we were at practice today and favre wasnt there and im the starter
1609488 i think weve been pretty united throughout this whole thing its definitely been difficult for all parties involved but weve tried to stay focused as a team
1609489 its gone on long enough the franchise needs to say one way or another we want brett or we dont want brett if they dont do it then brett needs to say he wants to be here or not be here
1609490 for them to keep us in the dark and have us answering a bunch of questions we cant possibly have a good answer for that isnt fair to us something needs to be said yea or nay for brett favre
1609491 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction
1609492 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1609493 the overall majority of people buy these diplomas to use in the everyday working world
1609494 theres a lot of potential harm here from a homeland security standpoint of someone getting a chemical engineering degree or just someone doing damage in a company because theyre a dodo
1609495 kept his name on the superintendents list at almost every quarter
1609496 the fact that hes emeritus speaks to the fact that he was held and is held in an extremely high regard
1609497 my faculty members all left and it was too hard to set up a new committee
1609498 if people think this referendum is going to save the maryland racing industry i think theyre sadly mistaken
1609499 if the referendum passes then it will be easier to encourage people to bring top stallions to the state of maryland
1609500 i know people who reluctantly left the state i think some of them will come back
1609501 shows that folks dont have enough information yet about what the cost of the amendment is
1609502 this is a multimillion dollar giveaway to out of state gambling executives
1609503 the study is just pointing out that it involves out of state interests in the horse racing industry as well
1609504 by far the most innovative and taxpayer friendly proposal set forth in the 50 states
1609505 i dont have my son why should those people have theirs
1609506 shes slowly forgetting him and thats the way its going to be by the time shes 10 shes going to forget all those hugs and kisses
1609507 we still believe the facts of this case do not merit the ultimate penalty of death
1609508 we feel confident on the issue of guilt and innocence

1609539 we accomplish this by standing shoulder to shoulder with our isf brothers defending the people of rashid together we conduct relentless offensive operations designed to kill capture or drive from rashid anyone who threatens the safety and security of the people we have sworn to protect
1609540 theres been a measurable improvement in the security in the rashid district since our arrival here in march
1609541 when we arrived we averaged five attacks per day in the rashid district by july weve reduced that average to 1 5 attacks per day
1609542 we built on this success and have seen a dramatic reduction in violence in the past four months
1609543 when we look at direct fire attacks we saw 30 in april and five in july
1609544 it is my firm belief that the decisive defeat of the special group criminals and militias in may and june of this year has opened a window of opportunity for us to make substantial and lasting improvements in the rashid district
1609545 ive seen substantial improvement in the performance of the isf
1609546 they are well equipped well led and very aggressive they performed exceptionally well during offensive operations against the militias the fact is the iraqi security forces are increasingly carrying the load in southern baghdad
1609547 its a real honor for me to serve as the commander of the raider brigade combat team

1609554 for all of you watching on television rest assured that i am working for you
1609555 the issue is bigger than mohamed dheeres dismissal i personally believe that the intention is to disrupt prime minister nur addes reconciliation process
1609556 mohamed dheeres firing cannot result with 10 cabinet ministers resigning but the president yusuf is attempting to bring down the government of prime minister nur adde
1609557 any minister who leaves his post will be replaced and the government will not collapse
1609558 if they had been conceived by ivf we would have been happy to discuss it

1609564 this one lingering issue is but a glaring illustration of the kinds of problems russia poses to the rest of europe it is therefore time for the eu to agree at least on principle to a common response to these shows of russian aggression the eus population is more than three times the size of russias its economy is 15 times larger but its biggest strength lies in interdependence solidarity and consensus when the next crisis comes all european states will need to be prepared

1609580 we have been lucky enough to be in a position to repair our dirt track but not everyone who has been singled out is in that position
1609581 some of the people dont own the access road so they cant repair it even if they want to
1609582 i am not just doing this for myself i am doing it for all the other people who have been affected by this decision i cant believe how the royal mail can treat people like this
1609583 i am absolutely amazed at the royal mail the roads are no different to what they have always been
1609584 i want to investigate this and cannot see how the royal mail has the power to just stop services without consultation
1609585 because of concerns raised by our postmen and women a health and safety assessment was carried out and it concluded there was a risk to our people and vehicles delivering to a small number of homes in the skelton in cleveland delivery area
1609586 we notified customers of the issues and are in discussions with them to find a solution to improve access to their properties or make alternative arrangements for delivery their post

1609590 i was absolutely stunned and i was very angry i just dont know why they didnt divert the plane
1609591 i had been talking to him all the way through the flight and he eventually told me when we touched down
1609592 he just seemed to collapse in his wifes arms and we all got off the plane
1609593 there must have been about ten fire trucks there we were right out on the tarmac away from the terminal they had to get buses to bring us in
1609594 this man was actually called back to the plane and the last we saw of him he was walking back up onto it
1609595 he would have thought to himself its a hoax i know its a hoax but i am afraid so i have got to go back anyway
1609596 im not privy to how much experience airlines have of receiving notes on board or if this happens on a frequent basis and they will never tell you but it would have been a consideration
1609597 there is usually a checklist which you would follow to assess the situation and decide what to do
1609598 i have been in situations like that myself and you just dont take the risk however small it might be
1609599 at about 6pm one of the crew was overheard telling another not to put the meals out because we were being diverted but the diversion never came and we just carried on
1609600 if we had been diverted it would have been an added trauma to the day and even if it was a hoax you would think at least the pilot had our safety in mind
1609601 airport staff immediately initiated the airports emergency orders and requested attendance from the emergency services in accordance with procedure
1609602 at school i always had both left and right hand sides of the brain working taking art and economics then i went to reading university to read typography and graphic communication it was a weird combination of the creative and the analytical i got into the minutiae of type spaces and layouts and discovered it was as much about psychology as aesthetics
1609603 heinemann were just about to launch a new reading scheme for primary school children and i had to come up with the typography to match their developing reading ability i would spend hours sitting in primary school classrooms getting kids to test the typefaces i designed
1609604 that was my own digital switch over and there was no looking back
1609605 when we merged with sbc swiss banking corporation we were setting up intranet sites for the merger mirroring the same content in both companies as soon as the redundancy programme was announced we put up this complex spreadsheet from hr which worked out how much you might get for voluntary redundancy it became one of the most highly trafficked pages on the banks intranet
1609606 in the mid nineties hill amp knowlton had a couple of people including now cmo tony burgess webb to whom cook reports who saw the digital train coming at the time everyone else thought they had lost the plot but looking back they were actually incredible visionaries
1609607 we had some fantastic projects with some amazing clients we spent 5 years working for the shell ferrari team doing their f1 sponsorship website each year we would rebuild their site from the ground up trying to make it better than the previous season we went from a java racing game that seemed cutting edge at the time to a full e commerce site big brands were throwing money at the web to create properties i spent 9 months on a health site for dupont containing some of the most detailed medical animated illustrations youd ever seen i did a european focus group tour with mori researching in two different countries every week it was great fun but i dont think well ever get back to those days again
1609608 they created an online currency using viral branding selling beenz to companies with websites who gave them away to visitors in returning for doing stuff like subscribing or purchasing
1609609 it was more business process re engineering than anything although you can never say words like that in a pr agency or theyll lock you in a dungeon working in a pr company i learnt the benefits of communicating what i was doing in a language that my audience would understand the biggest challenge is changing behaviour its not about technology thats always the simple bit the two other components in any technology project are process and people process is about communication but the barrier is people they are the ones you have to change most it helps if you are solving the right problems in the first place or meeting needs that people dont know they have then its down to how you do it i like to deliver value to the individual first the value to the company comes from that thats a theme i revisit in the book
1609610 i wrote a post about blogging communities and why they are more valuable to businesses than a series of loosely connected employee blogs its the archetypal network effort each new blog disproportionately adds more value to the community and the hill amp knowlton brand benefits
1609611 the stats are pretty incredible people dont believe how well read we are in march we topped 100k page views a week for the first time thats much more traffic than our corporate website when ferrabee wrote in 06 on ceo comms the blog post took him straight to the no 2 slot out of 60m for that search term
1609612 ampersand and collective conversation are great examples of knowledge marketing but like knowledge management it does not belong to one person in an organisation it has to be integrated into existing workflow so rather than thinking its friday afternoon must be time to create some knowledge we capture it at source as it happens
1609613 advocacy and campaigns for the removal of all constitutional legal electoral administrative economic security and any other form of obstacle to the full realisation of free and open democratic multiparty governance in uganda
1609614 we cannot sign an alliance with other parties the best we can do is to cooperate in order to remove hindrances to democracy in this country
1609615 if we dont cooperate to democratically remove this oppressive regime ugandans may have to resort to other means to liberate themselves
1609616 the community assistance week is an important event on the zdf calendar the spirit and purpose of the community week is to foster cordial civil military relations
1609617 we will prior to the commemoration of the defence forces day on august 12 take the opportunity to engender self reliance and educate the public about the role of the zdf during peacetime that it is not to fight alone but to contribute in nation building
1609618 i am pleased to note that our defence forces have embarked on several projects tailored to assist our various communities some of the projects are ongoing while others are specifically designed to highlight the zdf assistance week

1609678 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1609679 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1609680 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1609681 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd

1609724 many gaming in indonesia companies go pel mel spending money when there is a good cash flow while there is nothing wrong with wanting to expand it has to be done in accordance with accounting standards and detailed record keeping this is especially true for public companies private gaming in indonesia firms can sometimes let this aspect of the business slide alittle
1609725 ive seen companies with nearly everything perfect budget great it good distribution but a terrible working dynamic between the employees though the gaming in indonesia product makes it to store shelves the people working within the company feel miserable unappreciated and unmotivated
1609726 if you walk up to someone and say ive got a great gaming in indonesia business idea would you contribute 100k theyll probably laugh and consider you a lunatic but if you approach someone and say look i have this great idea and my plan is the following it will reassure an anxious investor that things will move forward with thought and purpose

1609793 it was good for paul parry to get on so i could look at the partnership with bothroyd because during the season that might be a partnership somewhere along the line
1609794 you need players who can come on and change games or change games while theyre on
1609795 our first idea was to get a helicopter in to lift them off the rocks
1609796 we called a helicopter in but it takes 45 minutes for it to arrive in st davids from chivenor down in devon and it was becoming clear to us that there was a high risk they would be washed off the rocks before the helicopter arrived
1609797 so the crew on the inshore lifeboat decided that they would have to act to get the three girls off
1609798 when the need arises we have got the equipment and the crew have got the abilities if needed
1609799 there is quite a high risk of people being washed on to the rocks or being injured on the cliff face there
1609800 if they had been washed up onto the gully it is difficult to see how they could have got out uninjured
1609801 both country heights damansara and borneo highlands resort clinch the coveted accolades after competing with the best property developments in asia pacific
1609802 however we see the commercial sector small and medium businesses and individual consumers still going strong we are excited about the market in malaysia
1609803 there is a possibility that it can be extended with the caveat that one has to look at the market condition
1609804 people will do things that they see other people are doing
1609805 it was your mother shell be home in about an hour or so
1609806 oh she thinks that im stupid so she told me how to make eggs on toast for later
1609807 it was my fault sir i had to turn back for the weevil spray
1609808 you told me to stay with her to make sure nothing happened
1609809 because were a team we take care of each other
1609810 im support im supposed to take care of you all
1609811 what i wouldnt make you go for this it was an accident it wasnt your fault
1609812 then why are you acting like he wouldnt care about you
1609813 ill just be over here with tosh okay you two can have your jack harkness fan club meeting on your own
1609814 youll have a headache for a couple of days and those stitches wont hold if you get too adventurous
1609815 i dont think youre giving either of you enough credit
1609816 jack loves us all we ground him to this world this life but ianto
1609817 ive seen the light in his eyes when he looks at you he cares more than you know
1609818 i know youve had a rough time of it here you let us you took everything we threw at you and never complained never demanded we treat you as an equal it was so easy with you here
1609819 we never had to think of the mess the lives that were damaged or ruined because it just went away no matter what happened you just cleaned up took care of the blood and the death so we never had to think of anything outside our own mission we could pretend things were always clean and uncomplicated because you let us
1609820 you act as if you deserve to be treated like that and i dont know why all im asking is that you give me something make me understand you
1609821 i have to have something when you leave me behind
1609822 youll go to a place i can never go all of you do ill be a part of you for as long as you live and i dont know if ill remember you
1609823 after a thousand lifetimes a million what will i remember what will i be
1609824 i want to stay here i want to be part of this of torchwood because i dont have anything else
1609825 no one has every treated me like i mattered even lisa it took her ages to go out with me ages more to love me
1609826 how could i even think that someone like you would want more than a bed warmer youve given me purpose a direction and i i love you i want you to be proud of me i want you to think i count to to see me because no one ever does
1609827 i wouldnt have hired you if i didnt think you were worth it
1609828 or if i didnt think i could someday get you to wear those jeans again but i knew
1609829 you were special ianto what happened with lisa at the time i would have killed you without a second thought but i understood i know how powerful love is how desperate a man can be to hold onto it that much love that much passion
1609830 when will imagery for my street my neighbourhood or my town be available on street view
1609831 i needed privacy and a lot of room so i could care for lisa before
1609832 i lost almost everything at canary wharf had to leave the rest
1609833 all i have left is our photo album and my bible
1609834 the first one after you gave me the job i bought the others
1609835 i couldnt see it i was so focused on getting her here on getting her well that i couldnt see anything else
1609836 i crawled through the wreckage and i could hear the screams i found people bits of people all over
1609837 i found her and all i could think of was getting away she told me how to set up the unit how to keep her alive until i could find help
1609838 i knew torchwood three would have the resources and i knew where to look
1609839 each piece got me nearer each scrap of information brought lisa a little closer to me again i couldnt see anything but helping her just get her safe just get here into torchwood just get the information just heal her
1609840 she was a researcher like me only only she was the best we had she was brilliant photographic memory intuitive knew the archives like the back of her hand
1609841 she use use to beg me she hurt so much but i i kept thinking i kept hoping
1609842 she was gone that was only a tiny shred of her inside the cyberunit just a memory
1609843 its hard to let go of someone you love but
1609844 sir could you would you make sure lisas family gets the photo album
1609845 its just they were nice people and would you keep my bible i its a family heirloom is all
1609846 you came here to make sure im not a threat to torchwood
1609847 you wont retcon me will you sir please dont i all i have are my memories lisa my friends at torchwood one my family please sir i want to die as myself not live as as a shell
1609848 i would never know why i was alone why i was so unhappy
1609849 somewhere inside my head would be those memories but i would never know why i
1609850 i never thought i would thank the person about to execute me
1609851 i know a place where they could be altered he really needs to dress like a professional hes too old to for the uni look
1609852 myfanwys going to molt in a month make sure she has plenty of food and ive written all the codes in my diary which is in a secure vault under the name gwydyon
1609853 oh and i ordered new signage for the tourist office
1609854 i am not going to execute you and im not going to retcon you
1609855 your betrayal hurt because i thought i thought someday we might
1609856 from the first moment we met i i felt it
1609857 i respect and admire you i wish i could have been part of your work
1609858 i am not going to retcon you i am not going to kill you
1609859 youre part of torchwood youre an important part ianto and i plan on taking full advantage of that
1609860 right now im taking you out to eat youre skin and bones then were going to see about getting you a better flat
1609861 of course with all this room we could move myfanwy out here and do without all the pterodactyl shit at the hub
1609862 its going to take time ianto but one day the pain will begin to fade and youll feel other things
1609863 according to the u s department of defense private lavena lynn johnson killed herself on july 19 2005 eight days before her twentieth birthday exactly how did she end her life she punched herself in the face hard enough to blacken her eyes break her nose and knock her front teeth loose she douched with an acid solution after mutilating her genital area she poured a combustible liquid on herself and set it afire she then shot herself in the head despite this massive self inflicted trauma she somehow managed to drag her then fully clothed body into the tent of a kbr contractor leaving a trail of blood along the way and set the tent ablaze in a failed attempt to cover up her crimes against herself if this story sounds plausible to you you may have missed your calling as an officer in the u s army because army officers speaking with a straight face would have you believe that such a thing is not only possible but actually happened
1609864 this takes you through the handbook of what not to do
1609865 we support our employees who we believe took appropriate actions at the time of the incident
1609866 we continue to review our practices and protocols in the wake of this tragedy and will respond further at the appropriate time
1609867 as soon as he saw there was no foundation that nothing had been done at all he started vomiting
1609868 sometimes the people from the church used to disagree but now they dont say anything
1609869 the disappointment i have is knowing theyll never be able to get those boys out
1609870 i see those bodies in that black hole totally covered in coal
1609871 fire us all it wasnt just me it was fire us all and get more players if we couldnt get it in that book the way he wanted it
1609872 i think its such a politically charged topic what do you do with these exotic animals
1609873 theres never been any problem with them mistreating the animals or problems with the enclosures
1609874 if theres going to be more regulations put someone on the job who knows what theyre doing
1609875 allowing it to enter the enjoining enclosure and kill an adult female tiger

1609879 i could feel the blood the wetness i could see it dripping i could hear it and the thing that is most vivid to me was watching that little bugger spit my teeth out
1609880 our customers asked for in flight connectivity and were responding by rolling out the most extensive wi fi network in the sky
1609881 however if anything were to qualify as a hate crime to us this seems like this might be it
1609882 to send a message to not just mr cook but the whole community that this kind of really complete sacrilege will not be tolerated
1609883 imagine if they kidnapped somebody and you make a plea for that individual to please return that loved one to the family
1609884 the whole community is going to turn to prayer well ask the lord for pardon forgiveness peace not only for the whole community affected by it but also for cook we offer prayers for him as well
1609885 but if i should be delayed you should know how to behave in the household of god which is you

1609887 long winded descriptive opinionated blogging from a guy in a rock band
1609888 although the tiger took both mikes arms at least he escaped with his life
1609889 its just a bar its not a music venue at all theres a pool table five feet from the stage
1609890 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1609891 had not received inquiries from credit card companies or customers about these alleged activities
1609892 semakin rumit dan kompleksnya upaya yang diperlukan dalam menerapkan hasil penelitian ke sektor industri menuntut adanya interaksi yang terus menerus dari berbagai pihak terutama melalui kolaborasi abg
1609893 together with the entire nation he lived through a great tragedy of repression he not only lived through it but through his works and his entire life he inoculated our society against tyranny in all its forms
1609894 he is a great citizen of russia and my favourite writer my favourite novel is cancer ward there is so much optimism in it so much life affirmation he never forces his ideas upon you but rather asks you to meditate and you come to understand its seriousness and greatness yourself
1609895 solzhenitsyn was one of the most important people in the history of russia he wrote exactly what he thought and needed to be remembered
1609896 its a disgrace so few people came you get the impression that the younger generations know nothing about him
1609897 young people today are politically apathetic they dont know who alexander solzhenitsyn is and they dont care about what we went through they only care about money we used to read solzhenitsyns books at night for us he was like a lighthouse for ships at sea
1609898 i admired him for his internal honesty and his willingness to stand up very intensively for his own views
1609899 of course nothing is eternal but i hope every generation will have a person such as him
1609900 i may have read something by solzhenitsyn in school but i dont remember
1609901 i dont know him so why should i go and pay last respects to him
1609902 we pointed out to him this has been a big issue for the aids community for some time now
1609903 there is less likelihood of it being used in the future unless we make it more user friendly
1609904 i reminded him we provided concrete proposals about how it could be made more user friendly and wed like to meet with him and his advisers in more detail there was no firm commitment to do that but he said hed take it under advisement
1609905 obviously because theyre describing a black shoe this does not match with any of the running shoes that we have found so far
