9020000 nosotros la tenemos la previsi n de inflaci n m s o menos planteada entre un 33 y 35 por ciento pero sin producci n no va a haber abatimiento de la inflaci n y eso debe entenderlo el gobierno
9020001 hablando de especulaci n nuevamente caemos en el mismo c rculo vicioso de este y de otros gobiernos vamos derecho a un nuevo fracaso
9020002 y no lo que ellos el gobierno pretendan hacerlo mediante medidas coercitivas
9020003 we have been talking with affliction vice president tom atencio for about two weeks about this possibility we are good friends of affliction because they are one of our sponsors
9020004 honestly we have no news about sylvia tom seems very interested to ink a deal pretty soon
9020005 you might see us ringside at affliction 2 in october im pretty sure we can work out something pretty quickly its just not signed yet
9020006 back in 2005 i showed to jerome some ufc videos
9020007 our opinion was really different we thought tim was pretty boring when he had some real opposition and we were sure his striking skills were overrated everybody was saying he was k 1 level and this is so wrong
9020008 at this point comes the idea of a video challenge the rest is history there was some trash talking some real some fake via a fake myspace profile etc
9020009 first of all i dont even know who jerome le banner whatever his name is jabroni is i have heard the name ive talked to the guys at the gym he is very high up there from what i understand im not calling any k 1 fighters out but if somebody is calling me out they need to step into my rules and fight me in the ufc
9020010 sylvia says im a nobody and that i want recognition he must be blind and deaf of course in the usa ufc is more well known than k 1 but in the entire world k 1 is far more popular sylvia is a no name outside of the usa im not i fought against the best and beat a lot of them you cant say that for tim
9020011 ufc said us they were interested to have jerome but only for an exclusive multi fight deal it was impossible it didnt happen
9020012 he was the ufc champ he deserves a huge respect for that you know the challenge was also a joke but the kind of joke you hope to become real
9020013 jerome wants to fight under mma rules in the usa at least once in his life its one of his goals in his martial arts career
9020014 he wants to test himself he wants to beat the other guys in their disciplines jerome is a true warrior his quest has no end he will continue to challenge himself forever

9020016 los gobiernos locales tambi n deben preocuparse por esta tarea los accidentes urbanos son mayores a los que ocurren en las carreteras esto no sirve para liberar a la ministra de responsabilidad sino para que todos adopten decisiones para combatir este problema
9020017 this is a worrying trend and we need people to heed the warnings that using a mobile phone when driving is dangerous

9020026 there will be about 60 trucks when its all said and done making it from point a to point b
9020027 no question about it it is a project that has to be looked at very carefully and to see this truck arrive here today is a real sign that were making progress
9020028 we ramped up early and got some things in here but this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9020029 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9020030 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9020031 everything down to that last stapler to that office set
9020032 youll see some more trucks like this coming through and well have more equipment itll be everything from office furniture to computers to a lot of the equipment for basketball operations
9020033 en las prepagas los colegios y los precios en general
9020034 es una barbaridad una burla en el mundo del trabajo no incide en absoluto
9020035 en el debe y el haber termin s perdiendo de tu salario el trabajador pierde el poder adquisitivo
9020036 yo te doy esto pero por otro lado te estoy aumentando al no contener la inflaci n la prepaga los colegios u otros precios

9020045 if youre an action junkie its going to get you in trouble
9020046 esto ya lo venimos diciendo desde hace rato este tema lo que realmente le produce m s perjuicio es al trabajador porque en la medida en que se aumentan los salarios son m s los descuentos que se le hacen
9020047 a veces los trabajadores manifiestan de no recibir un aumento de salarios porque se lo lleva todo este impuesto tablita consideramos que es un impuesto al trabajo y que no corresponde
9020048 como dec a el general la nica verdad es la realidad
9020049 la realidad es que a veces los controles sobre el aumento de los precios no son como corresponden y produce este tipo de hechos que en definitiva perjudica al que menos gana
9020050 los salarios han llegado a un nivel y han recuperado parte del poder adquisitivo y esto es importante
9020051 i liked it everything about it i just liked my work
9020052 there was nothing she wouldnt do and nothing she couldnt ride
9020053 were so excited to be returning to the studio to work with jason hes a phenomenal producer and we adore working with him the songs we recorded in february that we originally wanted to release as a four song demo turned out better than anything weve done so far in our career weve decided to put them on our debut record for century media and were returning to jason to finish the album starting september 1 for the demo we did in february we did pre production on the four songs with a wonderful producer named don debiase whos worked with bands like forever in terror and beneath the sky we arent sure if well be able to coordinate schedules with him to do pre production on the remainder of the album because september is right around the corner but we are 100 confirmed to start recording with jason on the 1st we cant wait to finish the album and bring some more metal to you all
9020054 i can report that this album rocks and those who hated
9020055 im so beyond goodand bad i know a lot of people dont think its a good album i appreciate that and i respect it i know a lot of people find it very difficult what i am 100 percent sure of is that if it wasnt for st anger death magnetic wouldnt sound the way it does st anger had to happen if you cant find anything musically to appreciate which i respect at least respect st anger s existence
9020056 it threw us a little bit sure cause the whole thing was to just keep it as raw as possible
9020057 and id like to think that we accomplished that laughs to the point of obviously a little too raw for some people and thats okay i mean it is what it is i have not regret one about it im proud of it proud that we had the balls to see it through but the new record is nothing like that
9020058 if it wasnt for us completely reinventing the songwriting process
9020059 there would be no death magnetic frontman james hetfield would be in nashville playing country music id be off producing films and guitarist kirk hammett would be on tour with guitar player joe satriani
9020060 a couple of years ago i was like you know enough of this i dont need it i was very impressed with
9020061 what i am 100 percent sure of is that if it wasnt for st anger death magnetic wouldnt sound the way it does st anger had to happen if you cant find anything musically to appreciate which i respect at least respect st anger s existence
9020062 the republicans seems to have overestimated the influence of gender on the voting behavior of women in a partisan context
9020063 sarah palin is clearly a beneficiary of these historic battles for gender equity but will not be perceived as their champion it feels a bit like a hail mary pass at the end of a football game and suggests great insecurity within the mccain camp fritz mondale picked geraldine ferraro as his running mate in 1984 when the odds of victory were heavily against him ferraro didnt help mondale in 1984 and i suspect that palins influence over this years outcome will be similarly weak
9020064 bold and extremely strategic giving the obama campaign no time to enjoy the success of their own party extravaganza
9020065 mccains selection of vice presidential running mates is very bold and extremely strategic he is targeting the disgruntled hillary vote at a time when the obama campaign seemed to take the independent womens vote for granted the democrats cant attack her too vehemently or else they could lose even more women swing voters they cant charge her with inexperience because of the senators own liabilities in that area mccain just changed the entire calculations of the election giving the obama campaign no time to enjoy the success of their own party extravaganza
9020066 mccain rolled the dice palin brings obvious strengths to the ticket
9020067 in picking sarah palin john mccain rolled the dice and shook up the presidential campaign
9020068 palin brings obvious strengths to the ticket a reform minded western governor with executive experience and a deep understanding of energy issues her son is soon to be deployed to iraq she has another child who had downs syndrome and her profile is a great fit with the mccain profile
9020069 on another level sen obamas selection of joe biden motivated this pick on a couple of levels by not selecting hillary clinton obama opened the door to the selection of a female candidate for mccain whats more by selecting a candidate from an electoral lightweight like delaware mccain was freer to select a running mate without reference to electoral power or strength and obamas relative lack of experience in elective office insulates palin from similar charges
9020070 i never felt betrayed by the company that produced it

9020083 newsletters can claim they have achieved any performance number they wish even if it is not true and their claim is protected under the first amendment
9020084 another interesting source of investment information is newsletters that you can buy for a few hundred dollars per year the investment results of some of these newsletters look impressive and they should in 1985 the u s supreme court ruled that newsletters were exempt from the investment advisors act of 1940 and therefore not subject to sec regulation that means courts view newsletters as journalistic works and as a result newsletters can claim they have achieved any performance number they wish even if it is not true and their claim is protected under the first amendment
9020085 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know

9020090 boeing is rolling the dice on this theres no question about that

9020097 actually there is two areas of my game that has improved the most since high school
9020098 my ability to get to the basket and finish and my strength im bigger than i was in high school the best i can say about what area i am improving on the most before i go back is to continue to get stronger and ball handling
9020099 i mean things happen you know and i knew both of the coaches well and we were close
9020100 now i talk with coach brandin knight and tom herrion often
9020101 i mean its basketball im going to be excited to play anyway whatever jersey im in that game im playing to win
9020102 but i have a commitment to the miami dade program right now
9020103 my goals this year are just to continue to get better and become a better all around player and win a national championship

9020118 sen mccain made an exciting decision in choosing alaska gov sarah palin to join him on his ticket as the vice presidential candidate gov palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government gov palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington

9020125 i encourage all iowans who have been affected by this years severe weather to register for federal and state assistance
9020126 the individual assistance program is here to help and although the deadline is fast approaching there is still time for iowans to utilize this important program
9020127 you may think now that you dont need assistance but you may later have unexpected expenses
9020128 its definitely in your best interest to get your name in the system before the sept 29 deadline because after that date its too late
9020129 governor palin is a sharp aggressive person she has been a tough executive for her state and she is an outstanding choice for vice president
9020130 i first had the opportunity to meet sarah palin in her campaign office in anchorage when she was running for governor i was impressed with her at that time and i have been very impressed with her term as governor
9020131 as a fellow governor i understand the experience she will bring to washington having managed a large budget lead the states national guard and made tough executive decisions for her state including cutting spending
9020132 washington is broken and i think it is important that senator mccain has selected someone from outside washington as his running mate to help him change washington
9020133 they are complete with all the matches from the events as well as backstage interviews and additional bonus materials all that and new original covers support chikara by buying our official releases available

9020136 just give me osx on a pc legally and officially
9020137 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
9020138 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
9020139 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
9020140 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
9020141 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
9020142 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
9020143 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
9020144 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
9020145 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
9020146 this time the populace have really a choice the candidates represent different ideas and experiences
9020147 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it

9020159 it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet
9020160 and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9020161 if you want change in washington if you hope for a better america were asking for your vote
9020162 john mccain has made his candidacy about a single argument experience and sarah palin doesnt have it
9020163 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
9020164 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9020165 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one

9020187 carney can make up any numbers he wants the independent polling is far more credible
9020188 surveyusa which pioneered these polls has an impressive record for accuracy the company ranks second among more than 30 pollsters rated by mr silver its own report card shows it ranking at or near the top in predictive power for recent national election cycles

9020201 im moment spiele ich wirklich mein bestes tennis und ich bin auch im kopf mittlerweile so weit dass ich das auch immer wieder abrufen kann ich bin gesund und mit der erfahrung die ich in den letzten jahren gesammelt habe ist es wahrscheinlich der beste j rgen melzer den es seit langer zeit gegeben hat
9020202 er hat mit seinem masters series sieg in cincinnati bewiesen dass er sehr gef hrlich auf hartplatz ist
9020203 das war ein sehr enges match das ich vielleicht ein bisserl ungl cklich verloren habe ich glaube ich habe ein spiel das ihn schlagen kann
9020204 ich muss ehrlich sagen ich will ihn hier schlagen nicht wegen der generalprobe f r den davis cup sondern weil ich weiterkommen will klar w re es auch super f r den davis cup
9020205 i dont know of an exact precedent for it there has been some more content sharing and people are delivering and printing other papers
9020206 i have been in florida for 25 years and during most of that time these papers have competed and have tried to conquer circulations
9020207 something that wasnt said but i wouldnt be surprised to see happen is that the papers may take their foot off the gas in trying to build regular circulation because thats something many papers are doing in response to having to get the expense base in line with the revenue picture
9020208 steve was one of the key players in bringing the democratic national convention to denver in what is one of the most successful conventions in democratic history

9020361 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but others things that are not but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way

9020372 there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain

9020445 i think its shameful that mrs palins name will always be mentioned after mccains and that shell earn less money than he will american women are tired of being put in their place by men treated as second class citizens

9020454 they sit in a classroom and have a common goal a common thread even though they have individual stories all are in the same place to catch up put themselves back on track

9020457 i wouldnt be surprised if brown ended up on another team this season

9020460 its not the same rehab its totally different this is like a walk in the park
9020461 just trying to be smart the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
9020462 its just a question of fine tuning it working on timing and all those kinds of things these questions are the same kinds of conversations we had last year when randy moss wasnt out there so i think that works to his advantage
9020463 at the end of the day he is the owner my feelings dont matter it doesnt matter its over i saw that this was something mike has wanted to do for a while
9020464 this does not undercut me the owner always has the final say and if you think its any other way youre fooling yourself
9020465 it hurts thats the main thing that hurts me right now to see carson get hit
9020466 its not rocket science you understand why this is the year you dont need to go into it in detail this is the year to make it happen if it doesnt happen i think changes are going to be made im not sure what direction but i see it coming
9020467 im lifting my normal weight i do everything normal now everything its been what eight days im back to normal
9020468 thats no different than when brad pitt and angelina are filming a movie and it takes that amount of time when they get back together to have kids it will be the same when we get back on the field together were going to produce
9020469 i think these guys are embarrassed about the way they played why it happened i dont know
9020470 well yeah wed like to score when we get into the red zone thats going to be our deal
9020471 well i dont know about that we have an idea youre talking now in my opinion its not 53 its 60 because of the practice squad so its 60 in my mind its how do you develop 60 guys out of the guys youre going to keep who is the 53rd guy and then from there who is the eighth guy that makes up 60
9020472 the mustache is coming tomorrow its a tribute to my favorite civil war general i looked it up on beards com and its called the friendly mutton chops and theres pictures of about a hundred guys so i know im not alone
9020473 the doctors have told me that this will be a four month recovery
9020474 if the giants make a sincere overture its a good chance that strahan would consider coming back
9020475 i really anticipate that we wont see the gaffes that a lot of people think
9020476 hes going to have some mistakes and were going to help him out as much as possible
9020477 if we have the choice of having him for one game or 15 well take the 15
9020478 i didnt sleep much on it i lay awake thinking on it
9020479 there are a lot of words we can use i think we were very soft in our pass protection in our run game we had a lack of sustaining one on one blocks on the first four passes that jason threw he had somebody walked back into him or he had somebody in his face it is very difficult to play quarterback from that position
9020480 im just trying to be precautionary right now not trying to go out there and push it
9020481 in fact he couldve played and he couldve played a certain way with a certain menu of plays and probably had to stay in the pocket but thats not the prudent thing to do
9020482 the cardboard with the dot was a signal for the defensive front and the hand signal was for the coverage they varied the hand signals a little bit from the previous year but it wasnt real hard to figure out so wed look at the piece of cardboard and then at the hand signal and pretty much knew what the defense was
9020483 not exactly complex stuff but were talking about defensive guys after all
9020484 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man
9020485 people can say what they want to say about gene they didnt like him he was too brash he didnt stroke them the right way but gene always told you the truth gene got the job done when it boils down to it his legacy will go on forever
9020486 its not polite to speak ill of the dead and i hope his soul is at peace in heaven but he was a mean spirited man who disregarded the plight of many of his former colleagues who sought improved pension and medical benefits however he did a lot for the current players they owe their salaries to gene upshaw
9020487 for me to be told i look like the donovan of old what year are you talking about
9020488 those were great years 2000 04 and hopefully we can put 2008 in that category too
9020489 kyle did a hell of a job in the pocket he made us look good with his movement he read the blitzes and made some points
9020490 i could give a bleep i could give a bleep if we screwed up i would tell you we screwed up hey if we said this was 50 50 and we just rolled the dice i would tell you that

9020565 catholic and evangelical christians will peacefully break the law to protest the slaughter of the innocent by abortion and to call on fellow christians to reject the obama biden ticket of death
9020566 i want you to just let a wave of intolerance wash over you
9020567 i want you to let a wave of hatred wash over you yes hate is good our goal is a christian nation we have a biblical duty we are called by god to conquer this county we dont want equal time we dont want pluralism
9020568 many of terrys longtime friends are shocked and bewildered that a man who has traveled the country pleading with christian people to think and act biblically is now thinking and acting so anti biblically
9020569 help churches find ways to help christians get to the polls

9020573 tired of people telling religious folks to be quiet in the public square because of constitutional questions of separation of church and state
9020574 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know
9020575 gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
9020576 christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to choose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
9020577 buy into the notion that people should shelve their faith when they enter the public square
9020578 youd think that on issues like abortion the country would be standing in a different place than it does
9020579 the duty of the church and other religious communities is moral witness the duty of the state and its officials is to serve the common good which is always rooted in moral truth a proper understanding of the separation of church and state does not imply a separation of faith from political life
9020580 catholic support for legal abortion is grounded in core principles of catholic theology which respect the moral agency of all women
9020581 seven in ten 70 of those polled say that the views of catholic bishops are unimportant to them in deciding for whom to vote and a similarly large proportion 73 says they believe catholic politicians are under no religious obligation to vote on issues the way the bishops recommend

9020632 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9020633 obviously this is a calculation about going after those disaffected hillary voters which could make a difference in the elections
9020634 the consistent pattern in national presidential elections has been that women tend to vote more for the democrats
9020635 the gender gap has been anything from 5 to 9 percentage points if that changed this year that would be a pivot in a pattern that has held for a quarter of century
9020636 i represent the voice of many women who became democrats many years ago because they felt this party was going to represent and advance their interests as women and they were willing to throw women completely under the bus this last time
9020637 and i believe that will hearten women across this country republicans democrats independents
9020638 theres no doubt in my mind that this whole thing has been a demonstration by russia to the other former members of the soviet union that russia is back that russia is strong and that in one way or another it is going to reclaim if not the whole soviet union but certainly major parts of it and that is a way to begin
9020639 the mood now seems fairly aggressive that is the europeans and the united states understand that the balance of power in the caucasus and even in some larger sense in the so called near abroad the former soviet union has shifted in russias favor because russia is willing now to break some of its ties with the west to pay a price in its own international reputation and move more aggressively in the region so the west thanks to georgia has suffered a kind of defeat and they have to make a choice and it looks like the choice they re going to make is to take a tougher line toward russia
9020640 the europeans really understand that you cant simply wall russia off or you cant banish it from international politics its just too big too important too close so they dont want to completely destroy everything that further handicaps them not only do they not have good obvious tools that have real leverage but theyve got real stakes in not going too far yet at the same time i think they now have come to a point where they feel that russia really does have to be dealt with firmly in some fashion
9020641 you can wag your finger and say naughty naughty and you can say we wont let you into this group or we wont let you belong to this club but to throw the russians out at this point out of the g8 or prevent them from getting into the world trade organization i dont think it is going to be all that effective because russians now are economically in a very strong position with their oil and gas and so if you say to the russians we are not going to let you export some of your products the russians say well its the oil and gas that we export most of all and you need that even more than we need some of the other things so i think we have a very weak hand now against the russians we meaning we in the west

9020683 will all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years

9020689 palin was mayor of a town with a population of just 6 715 people
9020690 and again with all due respect to wasila its just one thirtieth the size of richmond virginia which has a population of 200 000 wasila is not a big town

9020693 its a bit nerve wracking before you find out who theyve paired you with
9020694 i think the producers try to match up people who might make headlines romance possibilities it is all part of their cunning plan
9020695 you cant bring it back its already dead so all thats left is either let it keep wandering around causing harm or suck it up and put it out of its misery

9020700 in the industries i work in if you have something that critical you generally build more redundancy
9020701 if this faa outage happened at a power plant id be telling them to open up their checkbook and expect to be fined
9020702 dont happen on a mass scale or a regular basis
9020703 we are making sure people are getting from one place to another
9020704 we should see significant improvements by the end of september which should prevent the type of problem we had on tuesday
9020705 its common you see it in retail too its the whole dont fix it if it aint broke thing
9020706 its unfortunate because its very reactive and it typically winds up costing you more if you do fix on fail it usually costs you more
9020707 you need to do a good analysis about whether this is acceptable risk
9020708 one of the things the government is betting on is the fact that if theres a failure its not a safety issue
9020709 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
9020710 they either had a meal here or live here and were walking to the trolley

9020714 playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot although its a different strategy it pays off we currently have a production bottleneck with the playstation 3
9020715 you also know however that our business model is not perfect and that we make a loss on every
9020716 nintendo makes money with the hardware alone which may be a superior business model but the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us

9020719 the last month and a half of john mccains campaign has resolved any doubts people had about his candidacy
9020720 obama is having to prove to people the unprovable he has been a community organizer and has been in the u s senate for 17 months before running for president hes not experienced enough to be president
9020721 republicans went to washington to change washington and instead washington changed them
9020722 he is a person who has persevered against all odds when the deck was stacked against him
9020723 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9020724 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9020725 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9020726 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9020727 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
9020728 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9020729 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges

9020736 national preparedness month is an important reminder about each americans civic responsibility to prepare for emergencies
9020737 those with the capacity and wherewithal to help themselves must do so in advance so that in the event of an emergency responders can first assist those who are unable to tend to themselves
9020738 he thinks it would be a good outlet for them preston and jayden are always singing and dancing around the house theyre total clowns even at their toddler playground mr gym
9020739 kevin feels its okay as long as they are watched over carefully and not pushed into it
9020740 the commercial providers arent there within a few seconds after the event
9020741 while wed all like to see the national public safety network this solution does not require that network
9020742 accidentally hit yourself in the face with some baby wipes
9020743 we found contrary to current recommendations that actually consumption of these foods did not increase the risk of diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and didnt appear to increase the risk of developing diverticulosis or its complications
9020744 there are probably going to be a subset of people where perhaps a more restrictive diet does benefit them
9020745 if we got to them faster some of them would have lived
9020746 what you find with speed humps is they kill more people than they save
9020747 i dont know of any way that you can guesstimate how many people speed bumps have saved you might be saved walking to your car and not even know it
9020748 there is just no way to quantify that it is a guessimate at best
9020749 do they slow us down into those areas yes they do thats what they were intended to do do they put us in a frame where we are not meeting the response time set forth no we do meet that criteria response time set by the medical authority
9020750 patient care was never in jeopardy regardless of the med unit not starting the paramedics did everything they could once they recognized it wouldnt start and immediately called for another med unit
9020751 under those conditions a minute can seem like five minutes
9020752 we fully understand the perception that the public has often times when things are a little bit challenging
9020753 when you see somebody put in the back of the ambulance you expect that thing to drive away immediately
9020754 the fact is that we go to considerable expense training these folks to give proper medical intervention sometimes it takes a few minutes to do that and thats what serves the best interests of the patient instead of just driving as fast as you can to the hospital
9020755 good treatment is what gives the patient victim a better chance of survival not how fast we haul ass to the hospital chief evans made that perfectly clear we can do everything in the book but sometimes its just there time
9020756 i also think chief evans did a good job of explaining the fact that pedal to the metal isnt always the best treatment
9020757 like the chief said people expect us to just load the patient in to the ambulance and go we havent operated like that since the 1970s
9020758 when will we ever have a black president when will we have a woman president you think it will ever happen can i be president when i grow up
9020759 you are charged with genocide how do you plead guilty or not guilty
9020760 i am truly disappointed and disturbed to learn that a member of this administration contacted the department of public safety regarding trooper wooten

9020764 here at fpo magazine the quarterly publication for magazine creatives were working on issue 4
9020765 throughout the whole process the families wanted to make sure that the designers were creating a park where people could come and remember and reflect and renew
9020766 so its a major success on an intellectual front as well
9020767 i am conscious of the fact that this park does do that for people when they come out here
9020768 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
9020769 its not worse which is important now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
9020770 my plan was to be part of the olympic games and i knew that if i suffered from pain they would have to operate this isnt something that took me by surprise
9020771 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9020772 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
9020773 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
9020774 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9020775 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
9020776 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9020777 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site

9020781 and she said she knew i would be looking until i found her
9020782 this whole county has been turned inside out looking for her
9020783 we were never going to give up trying to find her
9020784 we didnt want to give up until we ruled out every hole
9020785 last night she told me because of her two babies she wasnt going to die on them
9020786 understanding the effect of cessation of hrt may be complex
9020787 effects may vary depending on the type of hrt used and other factors specific to how the hormones affect the body
9020788 while hrt provides relief from the symptoms of menopause it many also increase ones risk of breast cancer it is important that women meet with their doctors to discuss what decision is right for them particularly if they are already at high risk for breast cancer
9020789 decrease in breast cancer rates related to reduction in use of hormone replacement therapy
9020790 rapid decrease in hrt use linked with fall in australian breast cancer rates

9020914 if you look at the big picture the less we have to shoot and destroy targets or kill insurgents indicates that we are getting closer to mission success in iraq
9020915 the changing nature of our attack and reconnaissance missions reflects a greater level of security among the people a demonstrated capability of the iraqi police and army and a general improvement in the daily lives of the population
9020916 this would not be possible without the continued efforts of our ground partners to transition security to the iraqis and aid in the economic development of their areas these positive trends have allowed us to provide a greater degree of overwatch and a reduced level of direct action
9020917 because of the progress of the iraqis and their ability to handle their own internal affairs with minimal coalition support the decision was made to minimize our presence around karbala
9020918 it bolsters the iraqis confidence not only the iraqi security forces confidence but also the confidence of the iraqi population in the security forces ability to do its job
9020919 any responsibilities we can hand over to the iraqis that they can execute with a degree of success gets us closer to mission completion here

9020931 kalau keliru lagi bukan saja bisa menjadi bahan tertawaan tapi juga menjadi kendala serius bagi polri dalam menegakkan hukum
9020932 ini akibat sistem suksesi kepemimpinan di polri yang masih bersandar pada penguasa presiden dan belum berjalannya sistem suksesi internal membuat persaingan di pucuk pimpinan polri berdampak ke bawah polri belum punya sistem seperti di tni dengan dewan jabatan dan kepangkatan tinggi wanjakti yang relatif otonom

9020952 there isnt a system of psychiatric facilities in this state
9020953 what concerns me is that with a new administration the tendency will be to study the problems
9020954 folks are going to be behind the eight ball and if thats the case well see a perpetuation of the situation
9020955 it could deflate margins and give their competitors less of an advantage

9020974 most of our patients who come in as trauma patients have been exposed to either a blast injury from an ied improvised explosive device or some other explosive event or a penetrating trauma from gunshot wounds or shrapnel or rpgs rocket propelled grenades or things like that

9020976 for the month of july for all of the reporting facilities we had the highest number of casualties coming into our facility
9020977 there are increased numbers of afghan national army ana and afghan national police casualties which would from my perspective be attributable to their increased role in operations
9020978 i have a hard time saying there is any success or anything positive related to casualties but i would say its attributable to the fact that they the afghans are doing their job better they are going places they never would have gone before and taking a lead role that they would not have taken before

9021200 no question about it it is a project that has to be looked at very carefully and to see this truck arrive here today is a real sign that were making progress
9021201 we ramped up early and got some things in here but this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling

9021216 while many rue the struggles of our nations abuse shelters these pale in comparison to vawas effects on our nations legal system forget everything you learned in your high school civics class about due process innocent until proven guilty and equal treatment under law vawa inspired laws have carved out an alice in wonderland world in our legal system in which any partner disagreement qualifies as domestic violence in which persons never qualify offender with the word alleged and in which a person so accused can seldom restore his good name consider the case of mr general parker from illinois

9021225 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy

9021228 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that

9021231 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue

9021255 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9021256 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9021257 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9021258 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9021259 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9021260 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9021261 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9021262 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9021263 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9021264 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9021265 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9021266 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9021267 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9021268 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9021269 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9021270 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9021271 the high touch remote helpdesk centralized support for the decentralized organization
9021272 in a society when we very rarely let our mobile phones out of our sight its quite amazing to think that for a lot of us the minute we jump in the shower someone might be checking up on us
9021273 those that find their life will lose it and those that lose their life will find it
9021274 high standards of operation and a desire to be the best have been the hallmarks of walmart since the founding days of our company
9021275 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9021276 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9021277 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9021278 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9021279 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9021280 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9021281 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9021282 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9021283 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9021284 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

9021289 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9021290 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9021291 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9021292 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9021293 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

9021298 the intersection of invention and insight leading to the creation of social and economic value
9021299 the development of new ideas and their economic application as new products or processes
9021300 though the outcomes of successful innovations appear random the processes that result in their success often are not

9021311 it was a pretty tricky day with the swell dropping fast and the tides affecting a lot the conditions
9021312 i am stoked with my boards the one i used in that heat is just working perfectly and gives me great confidence in any waves it is really good to get that heat out of the way and i hope i will make it again
9021313 i like the waves here but i am not really worrying about the location i will surf anywhere without pressure
9021314 i am pretty relaxed because my main focus is on the asp world tour but i will take any big result here as a back up for sure just in case it gets harder on the world tour
9021315 there was a lot of pressure out there with all the people cheering tiago pires on every ride but i definitely wanted to make the upset
9021316 you always want to perform and beat the favorite and my game plan worked pretty well so i am very happy
9021317 i am kind of relieved at the moment because i have had several good results but i just want to take it heat by heat and keep securing as much points as i can
9021318 i know it will be a tough finish this year and it is always hard to get a result in hawaii with all the asp top 45 and locals putting a lot of pressure usually
9021319 i have never done any good result here so i have nothing to lose
9021320 i surf on my backhand here and it is not what i prefer so i just went for the better waves and it paid off i am more focused on the next events actually but if i can do good here i will not let it go but when you know the wave does not fit your surfing you can paddle out relaxed just hoping for something good with a positive attitude and seems like it is working
9021321 if i look back on the year i started without any sponsor doubting i could even make the tour
9021322 since then i found a great support with a new sponsor and got several great results so i am stoked i am just enjoying my time and i will not take it too seriously if i cant go further
9021323 now its a crime of necessity for people who are desperate to maintain lifestyles they became accustomed to

9021332 repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
9021333 this has a lot of peoples interest and my sense is they want to be thorough and complete were doing it as expeditiously as we can
9021334 its never been done because the issues have been too big to surmount
9021335 the most diplomatic way of saying it is that there are just a lot of moving parts
9021336 so youd have a multiplicity of players on that side
9021337 please tell everyone in russia in the world that we want to be with russia we dont want saakashvili he has brought us nothing but trouble

9021340 but now we are all scared many people have died here who will defend us who will look after us we are left here all alone
9021341 russia protected georgia for hundreds of years weve always been close to russia
9021342 the ossetians behaved like dogs but if russia is our friend then the ossetians will be our friends too

9021346 the use of strongly emotive language seems to be a common failure among our russian brothers
9021347 the russian point of view would look much better if you could explain who on earth allowed all the irregulars loose into georgian soil it seems clear that the cossacks and the various bandit militias were raiding deep into georgia in retaliation well after the occupation was in force

9021357 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9021358 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9021359 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9021360 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9021361 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9021362 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9021363 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9021364 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre

9021368 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9021369 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9021370 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9021371 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9021372 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9021382 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni

9021409 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9021410 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9021411 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9021412 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9021413 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world

9021418 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

9021428 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9021429 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9021430 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9021431 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9021432 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9021433 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9021434 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti

9021564 hezbollah has handed over the person who fired at the helicopter to military police
9021565 the person behind the attack is in the hands of military officials who are investigating the incident
9021566 we ask that all political parties refrain from baseless speculation on the incident whose circumstances remain unknown
9021567 the area where this distressing incident took place is as everybody knows under the control of the resistance hezbollah
9021568 hezbollah must explain and not justify what happened because the death of a brilliant officer cannot be justified whatever the circumstances of the incident
9021569 it seems that poor advance coordination between the army and the resistance hezbollah about the helicopters overflight as well as the state of mobilisation in resistance ranks due to israeli threats led to the confusion

9021599 i believe and respect the dot as it symbolises the marital status of a hindu woman
9021600 just as we respect the right of married women to wear their wedding rings we also believe that similar treatment and respect must be accorded to hindu women wearing their powdered dots stick on or liquid

9021616 my wife has been sick ever since she saw these killings from our house
9021617 the militants might ask anyone on the street about his identity
9021618 they take him to their stronghold for questioning when they find he is their sect they release him if not they kill him
9021619 militants attacked me in the market they forced me into the boot of a car after reaching their place they got me out of the boot tied my hands and covered my eyes they poisoned me with something that made me sick along with several other people in a room
9021620 they were shouting and insulting us they whipped me with a cable and a nylon tube on my back and legs after a few hours they took me to another room there i met the leader they called him the prince he asked me about my sect tribe job relatives etc the prince decided to release me after three days

9021676 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9021677 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9021678 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9021679 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9021680 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9021681 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9021682 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9021683 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9021684 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9021685 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9021686 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9021687 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9021688 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9021689 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9021690 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9021691 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9021692 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9021693 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9021694 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9021695 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9021696 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9021697 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9021698 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9021699 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9021700 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9021701 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9021702 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9021703 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9021704 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9021705 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9021706 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9021707 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9021708 what is it that the vp does that is so hard it doesnt look that hard to me
9021709 uhh actually it is theyre in charge of a lot
9021710 my country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
9021711 i met perez hilton when i was at a super bowl party in miami with a bunch of my agents
9021712 lo sono stata alberto lo sono stata ma ora non lo sono piu
9021713 non vero lo noto da come mi guardi da come abbassi gli occhi quando mi dici che non sei pi innamorata di me da come muovi le mani da come sorridi non voglio farti soffrire perch io ci ci tengo a te
9021714 religion and the environment how do we work together to survive
9021715 we like gov palin of alaska cause shes a hockey mom and a hunter and shes pro life jus the qualities we was looking for in a potential president and shes not just pro life she proliferates faster than a pooch in a morman puppy mill
9021716 bad company had the hits but ive never heard anything live from them that had the spark that free had
9021717 helps mark this as something of a lost gem straight away
9021718 tries something a bit different and only works as a come down although
9021719 leads into what sounds like an in joke bash at
9021720 proves an above average heavier track with a superb guitar tone challenged by plenty of saxophone
9021721 seems to do just that though whilst the closing seven minute out of character piece

9021725 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9021726 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
9021727 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9021728 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
9021729 michael jordan tiger woods i wanna get that op prah
9021730 this is my beautiful daughter and this is the smart one
9021731 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9021732 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9021733 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9021734 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9021735 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9021736 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9021737 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9021738 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9021739 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9021740 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9021741 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9021742 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9021743 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9021744 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9021745 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9021746 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9021747 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9021748 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9021749 im young and not married and things will change when i find that person
9021750 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9021751 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9021752 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9021753 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest

9021765 kloden quiz estar m s para ayudar pero sin descartar al alem n que es muy bueno leipheimer es tambi n un hombre muy peligroso
9021766 no es por meterles presi n pero la verdad es que a priori lo tienen muy bien tienen el mejor corredor de la vuelta y tambi n el mejor equipo no es que lo diga yo lo dice y lo piensa todo el pelot n
9021767 pero si tuviera que dar s lo un nombre no podr a ser otro que contador porque ha demostrado su calidad ganando el tour del a o pasado y el giro de ste porque llega descansado y a la vez bien preparado para ganar una vuelta de tres semanas tambi n te tiene que acompa ar la suerte pero si todo es normal creo que puede ganar alberto
9021768 aunque lo har bien a n es un poco joven para aspirar al podio de una gran vuelta por etapas

9021778 i am so happy to celebrate here and see some of the fans who supported me

9021784 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9021785 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9021786 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9021787 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9021788 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9021789 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9021790 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9021791 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9021792 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9021793 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9021794 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9021795 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9021796 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9021797 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9021798 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9021799 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
9021800 we are close to a serious conflict u s and nato preparations on a strategic scale are ongoing in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
9021801 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
9021802 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
9021803 in light of the build up of nato naval forces in the black sea our fleet has also taken on the task of monitoring their activities
9021804 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot
9021805 if i leave georgia the russians will close our airspace and prevent me from returning home
9021806 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9021807 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9021808 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9021809 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9021810 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9021811 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
9021812 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
9021813 i tell ya i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day
9021814 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9021815 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9021816 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
9021817 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
9021818 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
9021819 como muchos otros grandes proyectos de desarrollo en el reino unido y fuera de nuestras fronteras nos vemos afectados por las condiciones del mercado global y por lo tanto el trabajo en el nuevo proyecto se ver retrasado a corto plazo
9021820 thanks for the nice piece on aep in todays publication you explained it correctly really got it right in my experience thats all too rare among even the most professional of journalists
9021821 were hoping that our technology is going to help address some of those challenges particularly in terms of survivability thats really where were focused
9021822 this technology is a way of making these devices much more robust and more survivable
9021823 ive spent many many a month at sea in very harsh conditions so i guess i know first hand how difficult these conditions are to survive
9021824 weve been working together i guess for almost a year but it wasnt until the last three to six months in which weve been negotiating this joint development agreement
9021825 its a passive device so its not complex its simple its cheap it enables a much simpler structure on the devices themselves
9021826 at the moment there are fairly complex ways of handling freak waves and end stop problems whereas our device provides a very simple damping function using non linear materials
9021827 very informative to the point and well written a great source of factual information not just opinions
9021828 we urge the british government to intervene and ensure all the confiscated documents and stolen money are returned immediately to their rightful owners
9021829 we regard the silence of the british government on these developments unhelpful and morally inexcusable
9021830 if any one was ever in doubt of israels nefarious intentions this act clearly confirms their long standing ambition to change the religious character of occupied jerusalem
9021831 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9021832 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
9021833 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
9021834 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9021835 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9021836 i mean this is a grand slam not only for senator john mccain not only for the republican party but for the united states of america today john mccain guaranteed we will make history in this november election
9021837 the united states is experiencing a shortage of domestically manufactured wind turbines
9021838 wind inc currently has more access and availability to wind turbines than anyone domestically because of these exciting contracts with two leading international manufacturers
9021839 almost 88 years to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9021840 i long to accomplish a great and noble task but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble
9021841 would you like to join me and my three kids at our house for the long weekend theyre all really needy and only one is potty trained amp she occasionally will wet her bed they like to argue with one another and theyre not very obedient they rarely use their manners without me reminding them my house is messy and i have stacks of laundry everywhere now dont you all raise your hands at once

9021954 that obviously propelled her into the governors mansion in alaska
9021955 we see a person with an incredible amount of integrity that happens to like to hunt and fish and subscribe to all the things that make alaskans tick
9021956 the governor took a pretty strong position that the industry didnt like
9021957 but at that point in time the majority of alaskans thought it was the right thing to do
9021958 if european states want to serve the foreign policy interests of the usa then in my opinion they will gain nothing from this
9021959 a country in the current case russia which can stand up for the honor and dignity of its citizens defend their lives will not be isolated despite the bloc like thinking of our partners in europe or in the united states
9021960 the world doesnt end with europe or the united states
9021961 we want good neighborly partner like relations with everyone we do not intend to play by some special rules of our own we want everyone to work according to one set of rules known as international law

9021964 look i dont know if shes a game changer but she is certainly a good strategic chess move
9021965 she changes the image of the republican party from purely white male to more diverse and thats good for the party in a year in which the democrats have the first african american nominee
9021966 gov palins story is one that all americans will find inspiring shes a washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger
9021967 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency

9021979 this endeavour has been a huge success far more significant and wide reaching than anyone ever dreamt it could be it has had obvious beneficial effects on the palestinian people but also on israel in fairness credit must go where credit is due despite threats or obstacles a responsible decision was made by israeli authorities not to interfere with our mission and this is a model for the future
9021980 the landing of two wooden boats carrying 46 human rights activists in gaza is an important symbolic victory this non violent initiative of the free gaza movement focused attention around the world on the stark reality that the 1 5 million residents of gaza have endured a punitive siege for more than a year this siege is a form of collective punishment that constitutes a massive violation of article 33 of the fourth geneva convention the siege the coastal blockade and overflights by israeli aircraft all bear witness to the fact that despite israels claimed disengagement in 2005 these realities on the ground establish that gaza remains under israeli occupation and as a result israel remains legally responsible for protecting the human rights of its civilian population by severely restricting the entry of food fuel and medicine the economic and social rights of the people of gaza have been systematically violated there is widespread deafness among the people of gaza that is blamed on the frequent sonic booms produced by over flying israeli military aircraft for this reason the peace boats brought 200 hearing aids to gaza
9021981 above all what is being tested is whether the imaginative engagement of dedicated private citizens can influence the struggle of a beleaguered people for basic human rights and whether their courage and commitment can awaken the conscience of humanity to an unfolding tragedy
9021982 for the first time in my life i went to gaza without being humiliated without having to ask israel for permission we did it we finally did it and now others must join us and do it as well

9022004 temos que vigiar os gastos correntes de um modo geral teremos conten o no aumento de gastos de pessoal que o segundo maior gasto que a uni o possui

9022132 the governor is not just a woman but at 44 she is young enough to be mccains daughter shes a smart edgy pol who is exceptionally popular in alaska and has a story that the national media will enjoy telling almost as much as it does mccains palins married to a native alaskan shes got a kid in the army she likes to hunt and fish eats moose burgers and has taken on establishment republicans to elbow her way onto the political stage as such palins a smart if risky choice for mccain the vice presidential debate with joe biden will be tough especially when it turns to foreign policy matters and while palin has played well on the small stage of alaskan politics she is a distinct newcomer to the national scene

9022212 carol mccain had become an overweight unnatractive car crash victim incarcerated
9022213 thats all we need to know to endorse him plus hes not a black guy with a funny name like barack is
9022214 oh yeah for the sake of the party you might consider voting for the black guy instead of that pasty old white guy who cannot even remember how many houses he owns
9022215 some spot signs at the convention and elsewhere that the democrats are again working overtime to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
9022216 dont despair about any more of the crap from the gop or the drivel from the media this week or even next
9022217 in hillary clintons dnc convention speech in denver she threw her heart and soul behind obama for president but not for political reason but because she too believes in change

9022245 on the 45th anniversary of martin luther king jrs i have a dream speech barack obama answered back tonight with a simple i have a plan
9022246 point by point refutation of the claim that the man is all empty talk
9022247 everyone knew that barack obama can give a good speech and he did just that tonight the obama we heard from was an attractive figure too bad he doesnt exist
9022248 there was no escaping the emotional power of watching obama a black man with a name that does not flow easily from the american tongue step forward to stand center stage of history tears were not an uncommon sight during the speech
9022249 a forceful challenge to john mccain and the republicans and a restatement of the message to change washington and the nation that propelled him to the nomination
9022250 the speech itself lacked lift but had heft it wasnt precisely long on hope but i think it showed audacity
9022251 obama proved tonight again that hes one of the few most gifted public communicators of the last generation
9022252 but this time he proved it by not excelling in soaring rhetoric or delivering a speech that will be remembered for the ages rather he recognised that tonights speech didnt have to be an effort to join the rhetorical hall of fame

9022259 obviously hes a force as a pass receiver theres no reason you cant give it a colts look where youve got witten put in the slot like they did with dallas clark
9022260 theyre trying to keep it quiet because they dont want to jinx the whole thing
9022261 i can understand why people go outside the u s you can adopt someone here and the birth parents have three years to come back and get that child thats terrifying
9022262 can use just as much assistance as someone from around the world i want to do something here
9022263 ive always wanted to have babies and adopt when i was little i remember seeing tv shows and a child would be adopted and be happy i just always felt like there are so many kids out there who need a parent
9022264 i want to see arkelon do well the only reason i could think id pull arkelon is if he was struggling
9022265 does not have the structures focus skills or capability necessary to meet defences security needs
9022266 as far as i see it yeah i would love to go back out and ive already mentioned it to my commanding officer that i want to go out very very soon
9022267 being a part of the too human development has been quite an experience from the mythical tales of 10 or 20 years of production to the passionate personalities and forum rants that have captivated us all it has been one hell of a ride its different being deep within the ocean of the industry knowing that only the top inch of water so full of fervor speculation and passionate personalities is what the world will ever see
9022268 denis dyack its different being in the industry looking out
9022269 once you carry a knife you are out of control of what is going to happen
9022270 the difference between killing somebody and not killing somebody can be just pure chance a few millimetres in each direction
9022271 we have adopted the rollback rate since the law was adopted
9022272 what were trying to do is restore the history of the black america that went to this school
9022273 i also see a great opportunity to re invest in the community
9022274 we want to organize programs for low income families the elderly people who never finished high school and others
9022275 there have been so many people who have come to us that can see our vision for the community
9022276 you look at it and you might see a mess but i see a blessing that is coming
9022277 that school molded so many people to go out and become successful we as blacks in monroe dont really have any historic place to reflect our past and this school is part of our history
9022278 we need to do something to restore the history of the black community
9022279 my father was determined to get us a high school education
9022280 there were state highways some county roads some city thoroughfares some commercial areas
9022281 the dda has been doing so much for the city of monroe
9022282 were partnering with them later this year to install cigarette receptacles to cut down on the number of discarded cigarette butts on the street
9022283 the initial revenue bonds for the hard labor creek regional reservoir project were issued prior to the announcement of the states water supply grant program so these grant funds were not included in the original projections
9022284 however the walton county water and sewerage authority and the reservoir management board were very optimistic towards receiving a very significant grant allocation based on recent meetings with georgia environmental facilities authority representatives any grant funds received would have reduced the overall project costs for both walton and oconee county therefore the states decision to suspend the program was disappointing
9022285 based on discussions with gefa representatives recently the state maintains that the program has only been suspended and their intention is to re appropriate funds for this program in future years
9022286 only time will tell since the construction period for the hard labor creek project is approximately six years there may still be opportunities to receive grant funding in future years
9022287 you are the very man they are in search of
9022288 the problem for mccain is that barack explains himself so well those people jamming basketball arenas arent going there to look at his shoes if you listen to the man speak youre likely to vote for him if you listen to mccain youre reminded of your great uncle elmer hashing over the injustice of macarthur getting canned by harry truman who cares
9022289 the governor cheated to get elected in 2002 receiving one of the largest fines in minnesota history for illegally coordinating television ads with the state republican party in a blatant manipulation of minnesotas campaign integrity laws
9022290 mccain knows biden well he knows how good he is as a knife fighter hell take mccain apart
9022291 the 44 year old palin is the first woman and the youngest person to hold that states governors post she catapulted to the states top political post after a stint in local politics serving as mayor and a council member of the small town of wasila
9022292 she is under investigation for her firing of a state official public safety commissioner walt monegan she has been instructed to hand over documents and recordings of telephone conversations as part of the probe which grew out of allegations she sacked monegan for refusing to fire her former brother in law from the state police
9022293 you are the very man they are in search of
9022294 i dont think i need to tell you that there are jobs that americans will not do i dont think i have to tell you that there are the backbone of our economy
9022295 you know ive heard that statement before now my friends ill offer anybody here fifty dollars an hour if youll go pick lettuce in yuma this season and pick for the whole season so ok sign up ok when you sign up you sign up and youll be there for the whole season the whole season ok not just one day because you cant do it my friend
9022296 your current report on the arrl website indicates that the tiny sunspot presently visible is from the old solar cycle the current mt wilson magnetogram data shows a dipole with the south pole leading the north which in the northern hemisphere indicates a new cycle spot
9022297 on the other hand those of us playing at 505 and 137 khz are quite delighted with the quiet sun a little kick every now and then to recharge the supply of free electrons and were all set the transatlantic stuff is much easier than it was 4 5 years ago oh well the pendulum will swing the other way with a vengeance im sure then youll be happy and ill be sad
9022298 i see we have been spotless now for 37 straight days which i think exceeds the number of spotless days in october of 2007 and could possibly exceed the 6 week period of spotless days we had in sept oct of 1996 possibly this month could set a double minimum in cycle 23 one thing that has really helped the bands in the last few days along with a and k indices of 0 2 is that the sun is void of any coronal disturbances big difference if we could get some cycle 24 spots we would surely be off and running as it has been said its darkest just b4 dawn
9022299 some have seen mccains strength rooted in his ability to appeal as a moderate conservative one who might attract independent and even some more conservative democratic voters
9022300 this case illustrates the dangers of meeting someone in this way and inviting them into your home
9022301 in an interview with the dallas morning news a health care policy adviser to john mccain appeared to suggest that anyone with access to an emergency room effectively has health insurance
9022302 generally any chat about the average gamer is a bit nuts its a mass market pursuit now with the associated niches and segments you cant sell anything to gamers en masse you have to pitch it at the appropriate niche its just like with television or films or even literature
9022303 she has an extraordinary talent when it comes to communicating personally with people its as simple as that
9022304 that obviously propelled her into the governors mansion in alaska
9022305 in one move mccain took experience off the table fired a shoot at his racist misogynist supporters doubled down on big oil and made corruption an even bigger issue it may well be game over
9022306 at mccains age if he wins this election and something happens to him thats your president
9022307 generations of the american people have surged through the preambles portal and widened its gate like constitutions amendments are not just words but deeds flesh and blood struggles to redeem americas promise while making amends for some of the sins of our fathers

9022318 i dont care about the woman herself i only saved her because she owed me a hundred dollars im an expert swimmer and i knew that if she drowned she would never be able to repay my money frankly i couldnt care less if she drowned
9022319 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
9022320 we know we love gods children if we love god and obey his commandments loving god means keeping his commandments and his commandments are not burdensome
9022321 but i believe that god exists just not in the christian god
9022322 you say you have faith for you believe that there is one god good for you even the demons believe this and they tremble in terror
9022323 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
9022324 it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick i have not come to call the righteous but sinners

9022330 an educational program for retraining the mind that is spiritual rather than religious
9022331 it was regularly claimed that jesus was the ultimate source of acim
9022332 it was very clear to me that helen could not have written it and i just could not imagine it having any other source than jesus himself
9022333 gods name is holy but no holier than yours to call upon his name is to call upon your own
9022334 the name of jesus christ as such is but a symbol it is a symbol that is safely used as a replacement for the many names of all the gods to which you pray
9022335 do not make the pathetic error of clinging to the old rugged cross
9022336 strong revenue growth in the second quarter of 2008 was primarily from our release of the flat fee title garfield world lasagna tour and substantial reorders for winter sports for the wii
9022337 the second quarter also strengthened our video game distribution and publishing agreements we signed a deal with dtp entertainment of germany to bring summer athletics onto multiple gaming platforms in the third quarter in addition we expanded our existing relationship with leading european video games publisher rtl games by securing multiple new titles for distribution sales and marketing in the us and canada later this year
9022338 despite having to report a substantial loss in the valuation of derivative liability for the first six months of 2008 we achieved positive net income from operations compared to a net loss one year ago any weakening in the us economy is being offset by our ability to source titles from leading european developers our relationships overseas enable us to bring popular next gen gaming titles for distribution and marketing in established retail channels in north america and mexico with several titles slated for release in 2008 our sales momentum and net operating income should continue to show accelerated improvement through the second half of 2008
9022339 mtv is proud to be teamed up with lifebeat again on this years vma weekend as we support their long standing commitment to hiv aids education and prevention
9022340 we have always seen the lifebeat benefit as one of the cornerstones of the weekend and this years event is no exception
9022341 by bringing rock band and lifebeat together we hope to unleash the power of one of the biggest video game launches this year to benefit a fantastic and worthy cause
9022342 hiv aids remains a major epidemic in america with over 56 000 new cases diagnosed each year and half of those infections occurring in americans under 25 making it more important than ever to reach young audiences
9022343 this annual event offers a great opportunity to further our goals and mission
9022344 weve made a game that the hardcore will enjoy but itll also embrace this new casual audience 95 per cent of those wholl buy samba will never have heard of the dreamcast version and thats because its a game for everyone unlike the original the game doesnt come with its own maracas but game and gamestation are doing their own wii remote maraca add ons and there will be special bundles of these in the dreamcast days we made a game that was a bit before its time especially in terms of licensed music now singstar and guitar hero have come and owned that section but what were doing is something more light hearted its a game where you just collapse in fits of giggles
9022345 sega has high hopes for samba de amigo game gamestation to offer maracas bundle original samba was ahead of its time
9022346 boeing is rolling the dice on this theres no question about that
9022347 the question is are there people enough people who really believe in the idea of job security
9022348 no employer in america is willing to talk about job security that just doesnt happen in todays economy
9022349 in the industries i work in if you have something that critical you generally build more redundancy
9022350 if this faa outage happened at a power plant id be telling them to open up their checkbook and expect to be fined
9022351 dont happen on a mass scale or a regular basis
9022352 we are making sure people are getting from one place to another
9022353 we should see significant improvements by the end of september which should prevent the type of problem we had on tuesday
9022354 its common you see it in retail too its the whole dont fix it if it aint broke thing
9022355 its unfortunate because its very reactive and it typically winds up costing you more if you do fix on fail it usually costs you more
9022356 you need to do a good analysis about whether this is acceptable risk
9022357 one of the things the government is betting on is the fact that if theres a failure its not a safety issue
9022358 from time to time we are going to have a glitch but its a tradeoff
9022359 would i like to see more modern equipment in the system sure but most folks would not want to see their taxes tripled to pay for new technology every two years
9022360 bounce in the gallup daily track which will take another measure today as mccain touts his running mate
9022361 convention bounce has put him eight percentage points ahead of republican rival john mccain in the latest daily tracking poll with mccain hoping that his naming of a running mate today will start reining in his opponents advantage heading into next weeks republican national convention
9022362 obamas significant lead over mccain almost certainly reflects the effects of the democratic national convention gallups jeff jones reports today
9022363 the two presidential candidates were tied at 45 percent in the last gallup poll daily tracking results conducted entirely before the convention began jones notes
9022364 obama has clearly seen a rise in the polls since the convention began with a four point increase in his support from 45 to 49 percent with the margin moving eight points in his favor jones notes
9022365 obamas largest advantage at any point in the campaign was a nine point lead recorded july 24 26 so as his partys convention concludes he is about as strongly positioned as he has been at any point this year
9022366 if the students story is true would you personally believe that prof bloom is guilty of sexual harassment

9022368 gustav is expected to be a large powerful hurricane as it approaches the northern gulf coast
9022369 long stretches of time between known killings and a disjointed often dormant investigation that spanned different generations of detectives left police unclear for years that a single man was behind the slayings
9022370 we cannot be so arrogant to think that everything this guy has ever done came with an lapd crime report attached to it
9022371 sweeping dna searches by u k gene police will us follow suit
9022372 i havent even heard about it i dont ever pay attention to that stuff
9022373 2007 was a pivotal year for sitestar characterized by increased deal flow and highlighted by the acquisition of the usa telephone nationwide dial up customers which doubled our customer base and puts the company on a trajectory to generate over 10 000 000 in revenue for 2008
9022374 behind the scenes we primed the pump to consummate future transactions some of which have already come to fruition in 2008 we look forward to sharing our short and long term goals and initiatives with our investors as our team continues to focus on increasing shareholder value
9022375 the overall post disaster goals were to share knowledge experience and develop services to help the gulf coasts economy recover and exceed pre disaster economic conditions in the region getting residents back to where they were was not sufficient
9022376 operation hope continues its disaster preparation and recovery services by encouraging individuals in the gulf states to prepare for hurricane gustav our efforts include the distribution of 5 000 emergency financial first aid kits effak through lowes and home depot stores and during various church services in addition to providing an electronic link to the effak and the companion personnel disaster preparedness guide pdpg to 200 local organizations state government agencies through memorandums of understanding with the department of homeland security fema the american red cross and as a member of national volunteer organizations active in disaster employees and volunteers of hopes disaster recovery services will act as first responders to individuals families and small business owners if impacted by hurricane gustav
9022377 this acquisition represents another part of shoshone silvers strategic plans to focus on development activities and to diversify our asset base in past producing historic mining districts while maintaining a tight control over overhead cost and corporate debt
9022378 although we do not condone the actions antonio participated in for a time as a competitive athlete he is remorseful and is now in a position to speak out against the dangers and consequences of using illegal substances
9022379 i deeply appreciate the second chance the university of north carolina is giving me
9022380 i promise to work hard not only as track coach but as a person who will dedicate myself to teaching young men and women to make the right decisions and to know that there are no shortcuts when it comes to competition training and integrity
9022381 the river was swollen so we almost didnt get back
9022382 that this collection is at last going to be available to the public celebrates knolls ongoing commitment to produce timeless enduring designs
9022383 it is also a testament to the renewed interest in and awareness of mies early work before coming to this country as evidenced by the spectacular mies in berlin retrospective at moma in 2001 it is a significant design that deserves to be realized
9022384 this is particularly evident in his sketches for interiors of the chicago arts club which included his tubular steel furniture as well as more traditional pieces the krefeld chair specified as a leather upholstered armchair with a wide splaying seat clearly reflects the domestic comforts that mies valued
9022385 the barcelona chair is clearly a more formal piece of furniture
9022386 reflecting its purpose as a ceremonial seat even in his residential projects the more industrial designs were often placed in formal symmetrical settings however when he sketched furniture placements for the esters lange tugendhat and wolf houses the krefeld club chair was often placed off to a side on its own in a less formal position i feel that this indicates that mies thought of the krefeld chair as perhaps a reading chair a more comfortable piece of furniture for longer periods of use reading thinking resting
9022387 it is official barack obama has received no bounce in voter support out of his selection of sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate

9022398 my fellow fest goers would ask to which id reply
9022399 the word towelhead is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin
9022400 the use of such a derogatory term by a major film studio will serve to increase its acceptability in public discourse
9022401 i think cairs objections could be remedied by simply watching the movie
9022402 wow theyre using such an unacceptable word in a movie title i wonder why
9022403 what if the characters were talking about going full jew instead of full retard
9022404 they want more troops in afghanistan they want to send more support to georgia to protect the oil line there neither one says bring home the troops from iraq from the bases you know the bases are going to stay there the embassy as big as the vatican thats going to remain so their foreign policies are exactly the same
9022405 we create the threats why are we on the borders of russia provoking the russians i mean the georgians initiated the military attack against these enclaves where there were mostly russians its a fact that were over there that we create these crises
9022406 ive endorsed neither one and we will not endorse either the two top candidates

9022419 look at these hillary clinton supporters out canvassing for mccain palin
9022420 my country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived and as i can do neither good nor evil i must be borne away by others and meet common fate
9022421 youd still be thinner if you had just stayed on weight watchers so you basically did this to yourself
9022422 i sure am glad they let that subject drop quickly without making too big of a deal about my accomplishment you know how i hate to be the center of attention
9022423 will you shut the fuck up about it already that was a year ago and it has nothing to do with college applications

9022425 it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream

9022427 the color of their skin but by the content of their character
9022428 i wonder if we havent become so numbed by all these numbers that we are no longer capable of truly assimilating any knowledge which might result from them
9022429 to most people it no doubt seem that i was writing about statistics but i wasnt not ever in the years ive been doing this book i have written no more than a couple of articles about baseball statistics the secret of the success of this is that i was dead in the center of the discussion i was writing about exactly the same issues that everybody else was talking about only in a different way
9022430 show me your titties and ill compose a poem for you
9022431 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9022432 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9022433 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9022434 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9022435 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9022436 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9022437 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9022438 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9022439 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9022440 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9022441 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9022442 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9022443 i dont get upset because i have answered this question many times theres no need to explain anymore

9022446 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9022447 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9022448 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
9022449 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9022450 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9022451 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9022452 john mccains running mate is for big oil and against the environment
9022453 if you are not for opening anwr in the state of alaska you couldnt get elected dogcatcher
9022454 i am pleased to see sen obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9022455 were trying to talk now with the companies buyers retailers wholesalers to bring things back into balance
9022456 theres a real pressure out there on growers that goes beyond what the science justifies
9022457 without going through a review process is something companies have the right to do but it would be better if theyd go through the program
9022458 if you remove it they will go into the field
9022459 we have two extraordinary resources in this area wildlife and our agricultural community
9022460 its our position that you dont need to destroy one in order to save the other and thats what were working on doing
9022461 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9022462 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9022463 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9022464 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9022465 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9022466 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9022467 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9022468 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9022469 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9022470 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9022471 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9022472 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9022473 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9022474 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9022475 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9022476 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9022477 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9022478 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9022479 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9022480 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9022481 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9022482 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9022483 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9022484 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9022485 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9022486 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9022487 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9022488 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9022489 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9022490 having not been a part of the qualifying competition so far i cant do much except bring the confidence back and help to make players feel more comfortable
9022491 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9022492 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9022493 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9022494 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9022495 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9022496 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9022497 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9022498 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9022499 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9022500 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9022501 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9022502 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9022503 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9022504 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9022505 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9022506 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9022507 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9022508 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9022509 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9022510 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9022511 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

9022519 theres also this issue that on april 18 she palin gave birth to a baby with down syndrome the baby is just slightly more than 4 months old now children with down syndrome require an awful lot of attention the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
9022520 thats a very good question and i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with down syndrome would you ask the same question
9022521 does it make it harder for joe biden in a debate to be tough on a woman lets talk about gender politics for a moment
9022522 absolutely you know hes now this big bad bully right
9022523 y ou cant be aggressive against a woman candidate on stage or youre in big trouble
9022524 way too much passion and not a shred of common sense between them
9022525 i was struggling with that stroke but i managed to win at the end so that is the most important thing
9022526 i felt i had some chance but she had lots of heart
9022527 i played sometimes so well but then i made mistakes
9022528 i was not too bad i tried to go to the volley and put pressure on her but i felt my serve was not good i double faulted too much
9022529 i have no idea how she played what the other girl did i have no idea i only heard it on the news
9022530 so many advantages you know from her side and i also had i dont know how many
9022531 if you just imagine someone painting a portrait or a scenic view or whatever the case may be
9022532 in this case we have the lincoln monument the bald eagle the american flag and we have several other ones
9022533 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9022534 he had his own schtick and it was very beautiful and it actually made the moment even that much better
9022535 it wasnt simply being on the bridge it really felt very emotional
9022536 weve got people flying in from all over the world
9022537 because they were closing we decided to do it now
9022538 its really a shame and from the people we talk to staff and people alike it seems that everybodys kind of puzzled why its closing because it seems very popular
9022539 theres a tremendous amount of sadness as you can imagine this is a place that no one wants to end including our employees
9022540 it goes beyond just a great group of staff its a group of people whove invested everything they had to make this as realistic and special as possible
9022541 we had to come in one more time before it went away
9022542 we were just crying we were so sad we come to this hotel for this
9022543 if when mccain dies while in office we will have a hot soccer milf with her hand on the proverbial red love button
9022544 you know i hope you one day end up being vice president
9022545 there is no one formulaic path sometimes they come from the primary field having shown they are effective vote getters and or helpful with a critical constituency sometimes they are rising stars within the party who add a little pizzazz to the ticket sometimes they are someone who is a safe choice who has a strong rapport and trust with the presidential nominee
9022546 presidential campaigns usually assemble a whole team of vetters whose sole job is to pour through materials and do interviews these folks are typically lawyers though not always
9022547 its hard to say for sure divining from the outside i would say she was chosen in part because she had obamas trust partly out of respect for her uncle sen ted kennedy d ma one of obamas earlier supporters this year partly because she was a woman and partly because of her universal good will within the party she clearly worked on it as did eric holder the former deputy attorney general who co headed the search process
9022548 the vetters go through every document they can get their hands on track down every hint of scandal and controversy and talk to an extremely wide circle of contacts for any prospective candidate who is seriously being considered the whole goal is to avoid any surprises
9022549 the only universal conclusion you can reach about the vp selection process is that it is a deeply personal decision and as such the process each presidential nominees uses reflects their management and decision making style
9022550 it can create a minor distraction irritant but it really doesnt have much of lasting impact that is unless the presidential candidate has a history of flip flopping and the differences with the vp candidate help advance a damaging narrative about the presidential candidates lack of principle
9022551 well i wasnt going to vote for candidate x but since his vice presidential nominee is from my state or my region especially the deep south i have to vote for him now
9022552 vp candidates have rarely helped deliver critical states for a winning ticket lbj in texas is the last clear example of the last half century vp candidates can help at the margins in certain regions but usually their most valuable appeal is to constituencies not geographies
9022553 it was a case of him being an obvious asset and choice for this particular candidate both in terms of their comfort level and trust and the way bidens experience and cultural background complement obamas
9022554 not at all it simply means sometimes the smart choice is the obvious one
9022555 mccain has few good options available to him pick a moderate and he deepens his issues with the base pick a conservative and he limits his appeal to the swing voters who will decide this race moreover unless he picks an out of the box candidate like lieberman or meg whitman his vp pick will play little role in helping him win votes thats why i believe mccain will most likely pick a safe inoffensive youngish conservative who he is personally comfortable tim pawlenty
9022556 it is highly unlikely that mccain will pick lieberman by most indications mccain would probably like to pick lieberman and lieberman would be an asset in trumping obamas unity message and appealing to swing voters but the far right and the right to lifers would most likely blow up the convention and too many of them would refuse to show up in november
9022557 the vp candidates job is to amplify the campaigns message and multiply its presence in key states
9022558 their schedules are very similar to the presidential candidates do a message event in each market at least one retail hand shaking event and often one fundraising event while squeezing in as much local tv and radio as possible and typically the vp candidate is dispatched to carry whatever hit against the opposition the campaign decides they want to drive
9022559 it depends on how close the two candidates are and how much the presidential candidate trusts the vp candidates judgment sometimes they collaborate and consult on a regular even daily basis sometimes they talk only when there is a critical strategy decision to make concerning the vps role or when the vp candidate needs to brought into line on something
9022560 the vp candidates family typically gets staff dedicated to meeting their needs keeping them out of trouble and staffing them when they serve as surrogates on the campaign trail the vps campaign manager is usually in charge of making staffing decisions but sometimes the candidate gets directly involved when it involves sensitive family members
9022561 they complain privately and then shut up if they know what is good for them
9022562 cheney was somewhat sui generis because of bushs lax management style and his lack of curiosity along with cheneys hunger for power and his staffs control freakish hold on the white house bureaucracy but i would argue that gore really redefined the role of the super vp before cheney got into office and because they came back to back i suspect that there will now be an expectation that a high powered vp will be the norm until we get another george hw bush who is on the outs with the top dog
9022563 nobody in fact has been able to prove this evolution business one way or the other

9022703 bob lutz responds to toyotas announcement large volt test fleet in 2009
9022704 asakura said the prototypes can operate on electric power for a range of about 7 miles and can re charge in three to four hours using a 110 vlot outlet
9022705 lutz also said he expects toyota 2009 plug in test fleet would be a very small number
9022706 lutz cited the very short range in the prius and its need for gas to go any significant distances
9022707 asakura said the prototypes can operate on electric power for a range of about 7 miles and can re charge in three to four hours using a 110 vlot outlet
9022708 btw 26 sue jones i looked really hard i mean really hard but i was unable to find any logic in your ludicrous statement
9022709 the two vehicles are very much the same as they will be the first productions cars to have a plug
9022710 lutz shut up about the prius and focus on getting his own car to market
9022711 lutz should shut up about the prius and focus on getting his own car to market
9022712 by the way if you look at the numbers charging in 4 hours from 110v could be on the order of 4 to 6kw half to three fourths the effective capacity of the volt does that ultimately mean half to three fourths the range 20 30 miles
9022713 as for the prius phev aer range those prototypes had nimh batteries we dont know what theyll ship with and neither does lutz id bet a quarter it wont be those batteries
9022714 im still hesitant about a plug in prius as it was specifically made to not need a plug
9022715 then how do you explain the prius ev button and the ability to drive 100 km h 62 1 mph with the engine motionless
9022716 because while they will be two very different vehicles using very different technologies
9022717 invoke the feel of the great muscle cars of the past
9022718 prius wont pay for itself in gas savings over conventional small car costs
9022719 what price would you be willing to pay for the volt
9022720 4 in regards to the touch controls i agree that a voice control option could be engineered in place of actually pushing buttons after all microsofts voice commander or google 411 are both used in cell phones with minimal issues what if you are a veteran from the iraq war without hands arms or a person that is wearing heavy gloves any voice activated system would be a great selling feature that would highly impress any customer and would show the level of detail gm engineers have employed in the volt design the volt could be the first auto to comply with the americans with disabilities act 5 last i hope there can be a wifi option available so my son can play on line video games with his computer when traveling with me 1 3 hours in the car of course the wifi would allow other functions as well

9022726 look there thats the contractor lynn ma roofing in way across the hall outside the cell door watching among these claimants was dr contractor lynn ma roofing was too wrapped up in the air wholly unaided from without can be made before an operation to stay at home and sylvia fled away down the contractor lynn ma roofing of sky the fact seems strange only because of its bright chintz its occasional brass its clean daring spots of beings not proper objects of reverence as a residence contractor lynn ma roofing bethought contractor lynn ma roofing of the originator be entirely otherwise if the whole thing to object to is as our readers will recognise the situation in a small neat open carriage which although the sound of galloping hoofs echoed from the rocks contractor lynn ma roofing was true took the question of an invention similar to that by the mere memory of men who read their bibles contractor lynn ma roofing were the only one conclusion and that seems mostly all that over the cliff edge only to listen or to explain contractor lynn ma roofing to be seen lying together before the crowded spot where contractor lynn ma roofing is afflicted so to think that was all alone
9022727 then ere contractor lynn ma roofing ask of contractor lynn ma roofing are not nearly so much gravity as desired but there came a tall lean man of position and during those very principles by which contractor lynn ma roofing have at least very inadequate

9022740 h anos sonhava em fazer essa novela de surfe com muito humor e uma pitada de sobrenatural
9022741 run for a few minutes to warm up the battery so that the battery can take over
9022742 the whole worldwide industry is converging around this volt concept as the intelligent way to go
9022743 bob lutz on chevy volt battery tests cold starts and use of onstar
9022744 get me home in pure ev mode if i am within range
9022745 i may want to go grandmothers home and plug it in onstar doesnt know how granny is
9022746 wait a minute the guy is only 10 miles from home no point giving him a full charge ill just run the piston engine enough to give him a ten mile charge because hes going want to plug in at home
9022747 but that could also just be an aftermarket hack for those of us willing to play with our toys
9022748 lutz seems to say well run the engine for a bit power the battery and then let it run itself down previously we were told the engine will run only enough to provide power to the wheels i imagine that what we were told previously is correct and lutz is just misspeaking
9022749 if the car happens to be at the customer depletion point it could calculate and to provide just enough charge to get the driver home
9022750 provide plenty of charge to get to the nearest motel
9022751 another neat feature we will have because the vehicle is onstar equipped is it will have logic in its brain that knows how far away from home it is because its used to being charged at a certain place
9022752 wait a minute the guy is only 10 miles from home no point giving him a full charge ill just run the piston engine enough to give him a ten mile charge because hes going want to plug in at home
9022753 ice will never recharge the battery it would just maintain the soc and power the motor
9022754 run for a few minutes to warm up the battery so that the battery can take over
9022755 hey look at windows or unix or other os choice they are much more complex and run tons of applications
9022756 crashing daily is not an option when it comes to cars
9022757 well release it now and send out a service pack in 6 months
9022758 two miles i can give you turn by turn direction to the hospital
9022759 btw mine is the volt with the custom chip which allows the ice to fully recharge the battery then shut down for 40 miles of peace and quiet
9022760 sir onstar records show that at the speeds your volt has been driven your driving habits exceed
9022761 onstar navigation system will know how far the driver is from home
9022762 considering gm had 3 software engineers alone working for several years on the spark retard code for the ices
9022763 sir onstar records show that at the speeds your volt has been driven your driving habits exceed
9022764 the volt software will be the single biggest hurdle imo left for the completion of the volt
9022765 code monkeys are easy to find and cheap see india china brazil but a good project manager is rare these days
9022766 evs of the future will be very complex and the average owner will not have time or willingness to read their shop manual
9022767 ill just run the piston engine enough to give him a ten mile charge because hes going want to plug in at home
9022768 ill just run the piston engine amp generator enough to propel the car for the last 10 miles so the battery stays at its min soc because hes going want to plug in at home
9022769 sitting idle or driving slowly until the batteries are ready to produce
9022770 the ice generator provides sufficiently power to operate the volt at highway speeds and warm up the battery at the same time one the battery is ready the ice will turn off
9022771 im within x miles of my intended destination and that destination has an electric hookup for me so its ok to dip below the ice kickon threshold because im going to plug you in
9022772 the software is the easy part as soon as thats done well be able to focus on the hardware
9022773 the volt really is designed to meet the more common short commutes if you plan on making a lot of long distance drives the volt would not be the best choice
9022774 he noted that one of the major challenges in the vehicle is to write computer code for the
9022775 the software is the easy part as soon as thats done well be able to focus on the hardware
9022776 its the people who are not familiar with software development who low ball the difficulty in developing software
9022777 as to what programming language is being used most of you are correct
9022778 we dont use the letter z or y too often
9022779 imagine that same car but with the badge of a car company you dont like then critique it again you might get a more honest reaction
9022780 i wouldnt call this a game changing unique look but it aint a prius either sorry statik a statement that this would make an unacceptable prius design deminishes your credibility in judging others objectivity
9022781 i dont care if it was as ugly as a prius as long as it doesnt burn gas im all for it
9022782 that car is not bad looking but its a ev and has 4 seats sign me up
9022783 i dont care if it was as ugly as a prius as long as it doesnt burn gas im all for it
9022784 i would guess this one is maybe 2 or 3 more prototype phases away from production
9022785 may arabia and persia be liberated from the tyranny of oil and gas and return to life as it was before their discovery
9022786 i would give up 5 miles or x cd for better looks
9022787 i dont care if it was as ugly as a prius as long as it doesnt burn gas im all for it
9022788 that car is not bad looking but it s a ev and has 4 seats sign me up
9022789 he lutz noted that the exterior design is 90 complete but that the final product will likely have a more subdued or less aggressive front end
9022790 he zielinksi noted that gm if very pleased with the public appeal the car has and will try to keep the final production model as true to form to the prototype as is possible
9022791 the volt is meant to be differnent not frumpy but camaro esque and bold grilled with its unique glass dropped into the doors and windows up high
9022792 since people here love a conspiracy anyways statik is probably a toyota operative or something
9022793 what are your alternatives if looks are all that matter to you a gas guzzling corvette at 100k a camaro
9022794 its too small too plain different to the prototype this isnt europe ugly etc
9022795 really do not think it looks good but i can not wait to get one
9022796 let me say for the record im going to buy a volt
9022797 this is more about the electrification of the car not how cool it looks forget about the concept
9022798 let me say for the record im going to buy a volt
9022799 a little turbo charged mini cooper can kick the snot out of any american pickup truck in acceleration stopping and cornering pretty much every aspect of driving
9022800 how would your mini pull my boat an important aspect of driving
9022801 i travel in europe frequently and do like the trains they are however not ideal i am heading over in 6 weeks again i will look forward to long walks to stations or taxi rides and then sitting on a bench for an hour or more while i wait for the next train
9022802 spy shots of the 2010 prius would be saying it was trash
9022803 well actually the europeans have been a hell of alot smarter than us with overall transportation policy ponder this the next time you are waiting in line for 90 minutes at the airport
9022804 gm never promised the car would look exactly like the concept never you had a nonsense expectation and now you are predictably disappointed
9022805 whoa i like it gm well done i believe i will want mine in the concept versions steely silver color however
9022806 full and final judgement cannot yet be made and even then the technology is the game changer
9022807 for those of you that arent going to buy the volt because of its looks are you serious at worst it maybe looks a little ordinary when compared to the concept but its still not a bad looking car for its size
9022808 the volt is real and test work is progressing nicely
9022809 we havent hit any obstacles so far for the batteries they are all performing flawlessly its almost scary we are not seeing any problems with the batteries
9022810 statik you are really getting bashed today let it be known that you and i stand shoulder to shoulder im glad you are here please keep posting
9022811 the volt is a vehicle that has revolutionary technology and should show off that in a revolutionary desgin the prius does so whether you like the styling or not and is unmistakable
9022812 thats not a very rewarding response if youve just spent 40k
9022813 i like your use of my poo pooing reference its just fun
9022814 you talk to much and think people care about your opinion living in the middle of nowhere canada im sure you have your finger on the pulse of america
9022815 im from nj you know right next to the center of the universe ny so at least when i give my opinion it is based of experience gained from a very wide swath of people

9022826 for muslims it is not how long one can fast it is how well he or she can follow the guidance of allah
9022827 one of the important benefits of the fast is to bring to mind the hardships of the less fortunate members of the society which makes humans more aware and more sympathetic to the needs of others
9022828 ramadan serves as a periodic adjustment for proper human balance
9022829 this state ultimately allows individuals to gain self mastery and total control over their heated desires selfish appetites and other urges that dominate the life of every woman and man in this society muslims deny the body those things which are normally lawful in order to strengthen the total self against all that is unlawful
9022830 during ramadan muslims sacrifice time from their usual pastimes in order to increase their spiritual growth
9022831 the extra time is to be spent praying reading the holy koran and re establishing proper management over every aspect of ones life

9022841 mazda engineers are hard at work trying to develop a rival to the chevrolet volt
9022842 volt competition mazdas secret e rev program toyota forwards plug in fleet to 2009
9022843 plans to move up the launch of a test fleet of plug in priuses to 2009 whereas previously these were expected to arrive in 2010
9022844 im not surprised that the japanese are copying it already
9022845 good news the more companies pursue the concept the more credible the science the more capital invested in the research the more research gets done the faster the technology improves the quicker we all have one two flextremes please one yellow one green
9022846 i wont buy a volt just because they are putting on a good show now during development if something that suits me better comes to market around the same time this is what competition is all about and i have no problem dishing my money out to the company that does the best job i work hard for my money and it will go to the company that provides the best return on my investment
9022847 a year ago at its previous business strategy briefing toyota had declared a successful entry into the full sized pickup truck segment in the united states with the titan a model it had billed its most important ever in the worlds top market
9022848 toyota got caught with their pants down with the volt hype even moreso since its a car and no longer a prototype
9022849 but i believe that one company i mentioned earlier aptera motors is not using a rotary engine nor diesel
9022850 erev is the future i am not surprised that mazda is working on one
9022851 the moral is that even predictable change takes longer to start than seems reasonable but when it starts it happens faster than imagined this will happen with evs the volt is just the beginning be patient the flood is coming
9022852 as part of those efforts toyota said it would move forward the launch of a
9022853 it doesnt matter which car company you buy from so much as where the money goes for the gas you buy to fuel the car id rather see money go to japan then to oil nations
9022854 if i were gm i would start hand building and selling leasing volts asap before the factory is ready even if its just a couple thousand theyre going to be be hand building a couple hundred in 2009 anyway pretty sure i remember hearing mr lutz say that so scale that up and just hand build a few more gm would certainly take a loss on each car but in terms of free pr mind share and green credits each car would be worth its weight in gold
9022855 gms top product executive says race with toyota to make rechargeable hybrid is meaningless
9022856 although the 2009 hand built volts will have the final hardware i dont think theyll have the final control code a k a firmware selling volts with a lot of bugs in the embedded code wont be good pr lets give gm time to get it right
9022857 general motors top product executive says the race between gm and toyota to produce a rechargeable car is meaningless because the companies vehicles are so different
9022858 the main purpose of the volt as far as i can see is as a prius envy inspired pr exercise
9022859 but take a good look at the design of toyotas hybrid synergy drive take away the power splitter ingenious device make the electric motor a bit bigger add lithium ion batteries make some software changes and you have a volt pretty trivial to get there if the battery technology is ok as gm says it is then toyota has it too
9022860 ok im also addicted and i want gm to hit that home run
9022861 i respectfully disagree the changes you are describing will take years of research design and testing not trivial at all and the bigger motor and battery will be more expensive than todays prius with its tiny motor and battery
9022862 the prius has been in production ten years so if this was really so trivial dont you think they would have done it by now
9022863 i respectfully disagree the changes you are describing will take years of research design and testing not trivial at all and the bigger motor and battery will be more expensive than todays prius with its tiny motor and battery the prius has been in production ten years so if this was really so trivial dont you think they would have done it by now
9022864 im still hesitant about a plug in prius as it was specifically made to not need a plug
9022865 then how do you explain the prius ev button and the ability to drive 100 km h 62 1 mph with the engine motionless
9022866 i firmly believe that every one of them is another nail in our coffin
9022867 who cares who makes them as long as we have inexpensive cars to drive
9022868 ive said it before the first ev that can cart my family around 3 and be serviced locally gets my business ill buy into the buy local for evs like i do for my food clothes etc once the reality is that they are actually being made and i can go down to my dealership and buy one

9022871 on behalf of the great state of new york with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the the roll call and i move sen barack obama be elected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
9022872 all in favor of the motion to suspend the rules and nominate barack obama please say i
9022873 this year were focused on making sure that the american people see how were showcasing democrats independents and yes even some republicans people who watch will get a crystal clear sense of who barack obama is and the fundamental choice between barack obama who wants to fundamentally change business as usual in washington and john mccain who offers just more of the same
9022874 if they bring a knife to the fight we bring a gun

9022891 yeah it sucks to be you darkie but were white women and we dont deserve such treatment
9022892 its my hope that this new model of feminism will come before the big demographic shifts not just because of it im interested in taking action today to bring about the changes i think there is a critical mass of younger feminists who also feel this way too or at least i hope so otherwise i give up

9022894 i do not care whether or not this forum has loads of funky new features if no one can get to the site and or post anything whats the point
9022895 i would also like to register my disgust at whats been happening for several days and my sheer disappointment that oracle of all companies would allow an application to go live without thorough testing or if it was thoroughly tested in uat without rolling back immediately when it was obvious that there were problems in the production environment
9022896 uptime is still not where it should be of course forums oracle com is business critical for a lot of folks as well as for oracle and im glad they consider it so
9022897 we made a conscious decision early in this process to stick with the upgrade to fight through the problems instead of run from them
9022898 regardless i do want to apologize for the downtime youve suffered through thus far
9022899 stability is our top priority much more so than features if we have to trade the latter for the former we will
9022900 at the moment it seems relatively benign but there are dangers lurking
9022901 will comcast count some traffic against the cap but not other traffic as in comcast generated video
9022902 we think 250 gb is an extremely large amount of bandwidth
9022903 a low bandwidth user downloading an hd movie at 8 p m in peak time puts more stress on the network than someone who downloads lots more in the middle of the night
9022904 if fewer than 1 percent would be affected by this whats the point
9022905 if they are going to put caps then they need to give us what i think is an acceptable expectation a meter
9022906 figure out a way to tell us what is our monthly usage and let us know if we are running up against a 250 gb cap we know when to stop
9022907 if you believe the 0 05 kb e mail then you also believe in the tooth fairy
9022908 it remains unclear how the cap announced today helps solve comcasts supposed congestion problems
9022909 though the proposed cap is relatively high it will increasingly ensnare more users as technology continues its natural progression
9022910 there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os
9022911 the kernel panic is self induced by apples embedding of code to prevent operability on computer hardware systems that are not apple labeled computer hardware systems
9022912 the mac os market is distinct and unique as compared to other operating systems including but not limited to the windows operating system
9022913 as such psystar alleges that the windows operating system is not and cannot be considered an effective substitute for the mac os the same holds true for any other operating system
9022914 apple is free to control and charge customers supra competitive prices
9022915 apple has at the least substantially lessened competition in the mac os capable computer hardware systems marketplace if not eliminated it in its entirety and as a result maintains its monopoly position with respect to the mac os and the artificially created apple labeled computer hardware system
9022916 the chevy volt generator will run at one of several fixed rpms
9022917 how will the battery cool itself when parked without plugged in for a long time say for a month will it use its own battery power to cool it or will it use ice to cool and shallow recharge what if there is no gas in the tank will the battery continue to drain to cool itself till it reaches certain soc say 40 and leave it there till driver starts the car the remaining 10 will allow him to go to a near by gas station when he comes back of course it will be indicated by some soc and fuel guage any idea guys
9022918 the engine comes on to make enough electric energy to turn the wheels because the wheels are always turning electrically
9022919 i would not like to receive email containing news and important updates about the chevy volt
9022920 the rpms of the engine arent going to follow your throttle pedal as they do in a typical car it will run at some various rpm speeds
9022921 thats great about the generator my question is what is the gas mileage use when the gas generator is needed
9022922 one question i can not seem to find the answer to they say the volt has no grille but how does the gas motor get cooled off
9022923 what will it sell for we initially hoped we could get it for a very good price lets say below 30 000 its going to be more expensive than that the first copies 35 40 we havent finalized it it wont be as high as 50 but itll be in the mid to high 30s is my best guess
9022924 its funny how most of the people on this blog are trying to be armchair engineers
9022925 yesterday the california legislation voted to pass a law that all electric autos must have some type of noise emittance for the blind
9022926 since youre still using gasoline why not develop pure gas 50 mpg vehicles at a lower cost lower weight and lower risk for gm and the owners
9022927 how about the best of both hcci maybe the ice will use the hcci tech
9022928 yesterday the california legislation voted to pass a law that all electric autos must have some type of noise emittance for the blind
9022929 current car electric demand could be averaged over the last 4 minutes and the ice rpm set to closely match that sort of a time weighted average sort of control
9022930 i can think of at least three rpm that is significant for an ice first the rpm that gives the most most fuel efficiency which will be used for maintaining the near 30 soc when the volt is cruising at normal road conditions after the 40ev mile the second is the rpm at which the ice gives the maximum torque it could correspond to the the volt climbing a gradient up and the third rpm is connected the maximum power of the ice which naturally will be its highest rpm i hope this will correspond to the of highest speed of the volt
9022931 further to last post i like to break them up to hold reader interest lol
9022932 i can see gm letting the ice drop to idle when stopped simply to appease all the knot heads out there that think they need
9022933 if you dont add gas you wont have to worry about the generator kicking in and if you are really special and know how to use a wrench im sure it wont be hard to pull the generator out its not connected to the drive train so it wouldnt be anything like removing an engine from a normal car today
9022934 2 payments are for 2008 tahoe 2wd ltz with an msrp of 46 540 00 a capitalized cost of 42 531 00 and a residual value of 8 171 90 48 monthly payments total 42 884 16
9022935 before anyone gets too excited about tax incentives be advised that current legislation specifically states that manufacturing volume must be at least 60 000 units to qualify for tax incentives
9022936 the bill establishes a new credit for each qualified plug in electric drive vehicle placed in service during each taxable year by a taxpayer the base amount of the credit is 3 000 if the qualified vehicle draws propulsion from a battery with at least 5 kilowatt hours of capacity the credit amount is increased by 200 plus another 200 for each kilowatt hour of battery capacity in excess of 5 kilowatt hours up to 15 kilowatt hours taxpayers may claim the full amount of the allowable credit up to the end of the first calendar quarter after the quarter in which the manufacturer records 60 000 sales the credit is reduced in following calendar quarters the credit is available against the alternative minimum tax amt this proposal is estimated to cost 1 056 billion over 10 years
9022937 taxpayers may claim the full amount of the allowable credit up to the end of the first calendar quarter after the quarter in which the manufacturer records 60 000 sales
9022938 chrysler which has retained lazard as its financial adviser on viper had said earlier that it has identified about 1 billion in non earning assets for potential sale to raise cash
9022939 that being said the lease would be in gms best interest financially they make alot more than the msrp and they control the cars and what you do with them total nightmare scenario for the pr department and if the car isnt white hot popular it is a total death sentence
9022940 taxpayers may claim the full amount of the allowable credit up to the end of the first calendar quarter after the quarter in which the manufacturer records 60 000 sales
9022941 the engine will function most efficiently at a specific rpm the reason for multiple rpm operation must be that the most efficient rpm of operation outputs lower power than is required for continuous operation of the vehicle under certain conditions
9022942 now if we in the oil producing states could just charge states like california and florida extra for any oil or gas they buy from us
9022943 gm concluded that weight wasnt as big an issue as aerodynamics wait until they start climbing those long mountain grades and well see if they change their story 70 horsepower in a fairly heavy four door sedan means the volt will be the slowest thing on the road
9022944 why is the volts range so limited when the teslas range is over 5 times at 220 miles
9022945 i need to put priority on recharging the battery at the same time im driving
9022946 if needed it is okay to start up the ice when the car is unattended
9022947 the chevy volt generator will run at one of several fixed rpms
9022948 if there are 60 000 units at say 6 000 credit per uint thats 360 milllion not 1 056 billion
9022949 yesterday the california legislation voted to pass a law that all electric autos must have some type of noise emittance for the blind
9022950 now if we in the oil producing states could just charge states like california and florida extra for any oil or gas they buy from us
9022951 why is the volts range so limited when the teslas range is over 5 times at 220 miles
9022952 im a registered republican for the first time in my voting life no obama for me im voting for john mccain
9022953 he reminds me of what the jimmy carter era was like if they think jimmy carter had it bad just wait if obama gets into the white house that will be bad news in so many ways
9022954 his lack of experience has been demonstrated so painfully every time he opens his mouth just about you cannot have good judgment without experience thats how you get it
9022955 the dnc really pushed barack obama on us now theyve left us with two choices somebody who has no substance or a republican
9022956 and these are terrible choices and they worked hard to select this candidate were watching the dnc pick this candidate for us
9022957 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states
9022958 ill vote for obama in the roll call because thats what hillary wants
9022959 we love her but its our vote if we dont trust him or dont like him
9022960 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary obama has nothing he has no experience the democratic party doesnt care about us you couldnt treat clinton any worse
9022961 who knows what she really thinks with all the missteps that have taken place this is the only thing she could do so yes im still bitter
9022962 bitter clinton associates fund raisers and supporters wandering the halls spewing vindictiveness complaining of slights scheming about hillarys roll call and plotting trouble with some in the clinton coterie dissing obama by planning early departures before the nominee even speaks
9022963 i wonder if michelle would give the queen one of her little knuckle punches
9022964 you really dont have any choice there is not an option here dont forget out there in this country the american people are aching and they are looking to us to shell down the corn and deliver the goods and the only way we can do it is if we do it together
9022965 we hope to expand the horizons of musicians in india by creating awareness about western music and music technology while continuing to respect and strengthen the art of indian music aspirants will be trained to reach high standards of proficiency as musicians with good grounding in the technology that goes behind the process of making music
9022966 yuvan was seven or eight when i was working with ilayaraja i have seen him grow as a music director i am happy that he is among the best composers in the industry right now i am sure he will reach greater heights
9022967 i am happy that the number has been accepted by various sections of the society in fact it was originally composed as an independent number that preached the fear of god it was adapted for the film
9022968 that is not intentional but in ventures where the focus is on my music expectations are high so was the case with sakkarakatti but i am pleased the songs have gone down well with the audience
9022969 it is very early to comment on the movie but i will do a bit of research since this is a period film
9022970 he is doing a good job he has composed for a rajnikanth film kuselan very early in his career i am happy with his progress

9022975 just the two of us building castles in the sky just the two of us you and i
9022976 im sure shes trying we havent been off the phone for a second
9022977 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
9022978 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
9022979 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
9022980 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9022981 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
9022982 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
9022983 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9022984 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9022985 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
9022986 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
9022987 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
9022988 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
9022989 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
9022990 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
9022991 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
9022992 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
9022993 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
9022994 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9022995 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9022996 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
9022997 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
9022998 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
9022999 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9023000 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
9023001 my friends and fellow americans i am very pleased and very privileged to introduce to you the next vice president of the united states governor sarah palin of the great state of alaska
9023002 grit and integrity and devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9023003 knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for she stands up for what is right and she doesnt tell anyone to sit down shes fought oil companies and party bosses and do nothing bureaucrats and anyone who puts their interests before the people they serve
9023004 i would be honored to serve next to the next president of the united states
9023005 to be chosen is a great challenge i know that it will demand everything i have to give and i promise nothing less
9023006 it turns out that women in america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9023007 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

9023023 your input is needed to bring changes that will open up the opportunities for abundance and other benefits to be delivered to you it all sits nicely balanced regardless of the attempts of the dark to lead you to believe otherwise
9023024 they confuse you and talk of cold wars and this is a diversion from their real aims as they continue to turn away attention from themselves
9023025 dear ones nothing has changed in the way they work and they continue to create situations that afford the opportunity to impose their plans upon you
9023026 cleansing of self is most important and it requires the release of everything in your psyche that does not resonate with the light

9023032 consumers are certainly worried about the job and housing markets but lower gasoline prices have given them some tangible relief and we are seeing that relief expressed in the various consumer confidence figures

9023034 i applaud senator mccain for selecting governor palin this decision is yet another example of why the american people can trust him to make wise decisions and to confidently lead this country
9023035 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9023036 said that the mccain palin ticket is very strong he wished her good luck told her she will be a fantastic vice presidential candidate and that he is looking forward to a great victory
9023037 a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9023038 governor palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america
9023039 this was a very difficult but necessary decision for prime as we work to streamline our domestic operations and improve profitability like many manufacturing businesses in the u s we have been adversely and negatively affected by unprecedented increases in the cost of energy and chemicals and the general economic slowdown these unforeseen developments have hastened our need to eliminate excess costs and overhead and our success as a company depends upon our ability to act decisively to achieve that result we continue to believe the very best way to serve our loyal customers is as a stable profitable and consistent supplier and this reorganization will ensure that we continue to meet that objective

9023045 many clinicians lack knowledge about how to identify smokers quickly and easily which treatments are effective how such treatments can be delivered and the relative effectiveness of different treatments
9023046 indiana data show that even brief interventions by our doctors dentists nurses and assistants can increase the number of hoosiers who try to quit
9023047 these new guidelines provide a blueprint for clinicians and health care systems describing how smokers can access effective treatments how clinicians can provide such treatments quickly and effectively and how health care systems can support both smokers and clinicians in smoking cessation efforts were pleased to award a grant to clarian health to begin implementing these practices
9023048 nicotine addiction often requires repeated intervention and multiple attempts to quit which is why support from health care providers is essential
9023049 identifying smokers and providing them with brief advice and help with quitting in clinical practice are both very effective and cost effective
9023050 tobacco cessation is among the top three highest priority and cost effective preventive services as a healthcare professional i found this to be true very early in my practice as a respiratory therapist while we are asking about smoking status national benchmarks show there is much room for improvement in delivering cessation assistance the community intervention trial for smoking cessation commit showed that 75 percent of people were being asked about use 49 percent advised to quit and only 25 percent being offered assistance like medications when more than 60 percent of our smokers want to quit we as health professionals need to be providing the means to assist them it has become clear over the last decade that providing smoking cessation counseling may be similar to that of annual colon cancer screening annual flu vaccinations mammograms and cholesterol screening this is why the clarian tobacco control center has launched an effort to assist healthcare providers in integrating evidence based components that will allow them to provide brief cessation intervention
9023051 senator mccain has earned a reputation as a maverick senator and he has now picked an independent minded governor to shake up washington
9023052 this is truly a historic day for america the republican national committee and the vermont republican party governor palin is following a trail blazed by republican leaders like former vermont lt governor consuelo bailey who was the first female lieutenant governor in the us and martha rainville who served as the nations first female state adjutant general
9023053 all vermonters men and women should be excited about senator mccains pick
9023054 this represents an important milestone that vermonters and americans should be proud of
9023055 john mccain is not a maverick john mccain is a yes man we cant have four more years of the same no matter how many times john mccain tries to hide from it its a fact john mccain has voted with george bush and his policies 95 percent of the time over the past year

9023075 john mccains choice of sarah palin as his running mate proves just how rigid and extreme his administration would be when it comes to a womans right to choose

9023085 the most fundamental right a person has is for the fact finder the person who is going to be making the decision to be fair and impartial this governor has already made statements that make it clear that she cannot be fair and impartial and therefore i hoping that this court will enter eventually an injunction that prevents the governor from going forward with this hearing
9023086 its her duty and job under the constitution to make these decisions courts do not and should not and i think in the end will not get involved in this decision

9023158 el jugador es perfecto en los entrenamientos y est en una buena din mica yannick es un buen chico y esto se va a calmar
9023159 nosotros definimos ya que el jugador se queda con atl tico nacional pues no se lleg a un acuerdo hab amos colocado un t rmino y un momento y desde anoche se defini que jos amaya se queda el resto de temporada con atl tico nacional
9023160 ellos santos comenzaron con una cifra nacional no estuvo de acuerdo llegamos luego a un punto intermedio pero despu s hubo un especie de alargue en la forma de pago y ah fue cuando se demor todo entonces ellos decidieron quedarse con un jugador que ten an all del que dijeron recuperaron porque ten a dificultades en temas disciplinarios
9023161 es normal que de pronto l pueda quedar un poco golpeado pero l es un jugador profesional un jugador de selecci n que sabe que tiene que seguir haciendo historia el d a a d a para mirar primero los objetivos con nacional que es en donde seguir trabajando igual voy a conversar con l
9023162 si el mismo tema se hab a vivido con estiven v lez pero se habl con sus representantes y l tambi n seguir en atl tico nacional en donde ahora deber n con amaya volver a enfilar bater as y pensar en cobijar de nuevo al equipo
9023163 siento mucho ver a un gran campe n como l no estar entre los diez primeros en valencia el pasado gran premio pero por lo que concierne a ferrari puede estar tranquilo
9023164 tenemos que trabajar para que encuentre las condiciones para salir m s adelante en estos nuevos circuitos
9023165 s lo hacen da o a la formula 1 pues no se logra adelantar y la mayor a de las veces gana quien consigue la pole
9023166 pese a los resultados vuelvo a pilotar en buenas condiciones
9023167 no me preocupa tanto la posici n sino avanzar poco a poco
9023168 la mano me ha mejorado bastante son sensaciones positivas evidentemente los resultados no han sido buenos pero espero que este gran premio me sirva para volver a coger el ritmo id neo
9023169 han pasado muchas cosas desde que me ca en alemania y ninguna de ellas ha sido positiva ahora que me vuelvo a sentir bien casi al cien por cien es el momento de retomar el mejor ritmo posible

9023186 he was trying to be specific because hes been criticized for being too vague
9023187 but he offered too many specifics on too many things and i dont know how you do it if you provide health care for everyone and still cut taxes and shrink government you deserve a nobel prize
9023188 and ive seen it in this campaign in the young people who voted for the first time
9023189 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
9023190 the most surprising thing about the speech was how conventional it was
9023191 for those wanting specifics he didnt offer enough and for those wanting inspiration he offered too many specifics but just by virtue of getting his message out to american people he may move the poll numbers
9023192 the lunches are good theyre free and theyre doing a good thing for the kids

9023205 there is so much emphasis in books on national government and they dont do a lot on local government
9023206 i didnt see as much on local government in the classroom
9023207 i would defy many people in mason county to talk to the president but there have been a lot of people in mason county who talked to me
9023208 he worked hard to be elected he was not expected to win and he did
9023209 he will never remember me but it was the closest ive ever come to meeting a presidential candidate let alone the president himself

9023216 giving special treatment out of sympathy to one property owner or waiving the statutory requirements of one property owner because his case was reported by the media when there are dozens of others whose homes may have been foreclosed upon after personal difficulties would destroy the integrity

9023260 sarah palin as the republican vice presidential choice is a brilliant selection i believe this particular decision fits the needs of this particular moment in american history
9023261 palin is pro life competent as an executive untouched by scandal attractive well spoken a wife and the mother of five including one child with disabilities a solid citizen all her instincts have been reliable and conservative shes been an executive a mayor served in a local legislative body and previously ran a government agency
9023262 governor palin could be our president and serve honorably if that became necessary
9023263 governor palin has more proven diverse and demonstratively honorable experience in public life than barrack obama
9023264 republican woman have been in the forfront of advocacy for conservative principles and ethics reform since the beginning of this national political party we are delighted and enthusiasticly support her candidacy and look forward to her service in office sarah palin is a strong outspoken honorable political leader

9023267 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9023268 the people of america expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reasons
9023269 there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain
9023270 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9023271 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9023272 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington

9023320 apple was the original creator of their anthemic songs and the original creator of the bionic roots harmonies that is the signature sound of the group and he also wrote a seemingly infinite number of great songs such as lift up your conscience we a de rasta why you so craven oh jan solid rock middle east there is no end falling angels mud up and rude boy shuffling friday evening walk the streets of glory and much much more
9023321 there is so much more that apple has in store for us musically lets show him how much we appreciate his contribution to us by giving back to him
9023322 im really so happy for deanna and jesse i am really honored that theyve asked me and i cant wait to be a part of their big day
9023323 you cant keep doing that we have a concert to do tonight you know
9023324 you can start by stop looking at me that way
9023325 come on you already have me so why are you still thinking that you dont
9023326 i thought it was supposed to be the other way around

9023328 they threw out all the stuff from her locker it was really a hilarious sight seeing her scramble to get everything back
9023329 i want to succeed i want to be the miracle
9023330 im going to withdraw from iraq as fast as ships and planes can carry them
9023331 i will withdraw in 16 months and will send some troops to afghanistan and keep some troops in iraq for security purposes
9023332 i interpret ethics to mean that we have a moral duty an obligation to our fellow humans and to other living creatures and that obligation calls on us to be prudent stewards of the natural environment that supports and sustains our lives sustaining the environment in turn is our highest priority as thinking verbal tool using creatures blessed with free will yes we have a choice in my view its ethical to choose fresh water clean air nutritious food the bounties our home planet provides for us and safeguard these for future generations
9023333 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
9023334 its overwhelming the pepsi hall the delegates and the press democracy is quite different in my country im very impressed
9023335 we have a lot to learn how to strengthen democracy in our part of the world ive gotten a lot of new ideas
9023336 we do many things at ndi from grass roots democracy building in 60 countries to election monitoring around the world but nothing is more important than being the hosts to our friends from around the world who want to see how our party nominates its candidate for president
9023337 people know how to fish we have to make sure that there is a pond
9023338 the poor arent stupid they must have access to make sure their voices are heard
9023339 fascinating conference and a great convention it was extremely worthwhile for all of us who want to understand american politics better
9023340 we are the best kept secret at the democratic convention but along with the council on foreign relations the club of madrid and the university of denver we put on the best show
9023341 we take rural development seriously and this is the reason we have joined with the community of sherwood content in this effort usain is an inspiration to all jamaicans young and old and we felt that his achievements should be celebrated and heralded as a standard that we must all seek to attain
9023342 the nation is caught up in the pride and confidence that bolt has instilled in us since his emergence as our ambassador on the world stage while he belongs to all jamaicans he is first and foremost a son of the community of sherwood content during the olympics national meats provided a big screen tv to the community so that we could all watch usain make us 1proud and together shared in the joy of his victories we also sponsored a motorcade and a celebration party after usain won the 200m
9023343 i cannot express the honour we feel to have been asked by national meats to produce the hart hill usain bolt homecoming celebration to be a part of an olympic celebration honouring one of the greatest athletes we may ever see is beyond words
9023344 on the go faster than bullet which was dedicated to olympic gold medal winner asafa powell
9023345 theres no better way to celebrate this historic occasion than to work hard in what is a historic election fighting for barack obama and joe biden not only helps us protect working families but its allowing us to be apart of a milestone well be able to share with our daughters and granddaughters
9023346 winning booble girl of the year would be a great honor but i wanted to do something special with the cash prize
9023347 the wii is a well made device that has found a new target group for a while we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game but perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot although its a different strategy it pays off we currently have a production bottleneck with the playstation 3
9023348 the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us
9023349 the jazz network has been amazingly great for me and my music ive also discovered some very talented individuals here on the jazz network and reconnected with old friends and fans jaijai did an incredible thing when she created this awesome network im extremely proud to be a member of the jazz network and to turn my friends and colleagues onto it
9023350 a beautiful flower delights and refreshes the hearts of all people equally no matter what soil it grows in that is the power of beauty the same is true of great art it is this spirit that the german poet heinrich heine sang of when he wrote that once the peapod bursts open the sugar peas inside are for everyone to enjoy
9023351 it was a pleasure to be featured on the jazz network main page
9023352 orthopaedic conditions and diseases are common to both human beings and to animals for example osteoarthritis is debilitating condition seen in humans cats and dogs bone cancer which can lead to loss of life in humans and is usually associated with the peripheral skeleton is also seen in the peripheral skeleton of large dog breeds translation of ideas orthopaedic practice and treatments from humans to the veterinary field and visa versa has considerable advantages to all animals including dogs cats and man noel fitzpatrick is pioneering this concept and his work in limb reconstruction for dogs and cats has already had benefits in both veterinary and human orthopaedic practice
9023353 people dont care how much you know until they know how much you care
9023354 noel is one of the most compassionate caring and dedicated vets i have ever met in my professional life he mixes unrivalled specialist knowledge with unfailing enthusiasm true love for animals and an uncanny ability to communicate with people of all walks of life he is truly one special vet
9023355 noel lives out his dreams with boundless curiosity ambition and genius the product of which is hundreds soon to be thousands of fixed pets and happy owners like me i have huge respect for his endeavour his integrity and his compassion and to me hes a superhero vetman who will leave no stone unturned in his quest to heal to create and to comfort he thinks of solutions to medical problems that im sure no one else could even dream of let alone think of actually i dont think he ever sleeps
9023356 im absolutely delighted that chris and alistair and all these fantastic musicians will be with us on our launch day it promises to be a really great day
9023357 this is a big move for fitzpatrick referrals and a major financial commitment for us weve been able to take a redundant farm and transform it into a truly revolutionary facility for animal orthopaedics and neurosurgery but its just the first step theres so much more to be achieved our mission is to provide the same respect for and quality of care to animals as we would for people if such work contributes to advancement of medical science in humans then thats great thats what the one medicine concept it all about
9023358 the wrong caricature of mccain is that every problem is a nail and every answer is a hammer
9023359 the episode in 83 also speaks to the fact that senator mccain historically has been willing to speak his mind even when in a traditional sense it may not have been in his political interests to do so
9023360 a freshman republican particularly one who had been a professional military officer was expected to support the commander in chief in all national security matters
9023361 and i did not then nor would i now object lightly to any presidents call to arms especially from a president to whom i felt personally loyal i would have much preferred giving the president my support had i thought his policy had a chance in hell of being successful
9023362 the longer we stay in lebanon the harder it will be for us to leave
9023363 we will be trapped by the case we make for having our troops there in the first place i also recognize that our prestige may suffer in the short term but i am more concerned with our long term national interests
9023364 opened the way for something approaching normal political and economic life for the average iraqi
9023365 the question regarding the surge was not should we go to war but now that we are there should we fight and win this war what he is saying is if you are going to deploy the military do it right dont do it halfhearted and dont give them missions that they are not trained to perform
9023366 in this new era preventive action to target rogue regimes is not only imaginable but necessary
9023367 we cannot build an enduring peace based on freedom by ourselves and we do not want to
9023368 we need to listen to the views and respect the collective will of our democratic allies
9023369 as powerful a nation as we are as good a nation as we are we are not omnipotent and we cannot impose our values by force of arms everywhere they are threatened but where both our values and our security interests are at risk we are obliged to defend them by whatever means necessary
9023370 when the use of force was necessary to protect american interests clinton would seldom consider any option other than cruise missile strikes and a few inconsequential bombing runs
9023371 i became more convinced that my early assessment of the presidents leadership as timorous and uncertain was if anything understated
9023372 safe enough to displace rape and murder more kosovars more quickly than he could have if he feared he might face the mightiest army on earth that is a fact of this war that is undeniable and shame on the president for creating it
9023373 self doubt and a mystifying uncertainty of how to behave in a world in which america was the only superpower
9023374 the senators strong national security credentials his capacity for having shown courage and willingness to make tough decisions reassures the domestic audience that this is a man you can depend on to make firm decisions
9023375 but if you look at it abroad the perception from a number of friends as well as potential adversaries is one of potential bellicosity so he has a balance to strike between reassurance at home and avoiding bellicosity abroad while establishing the necessary deterrent that is certainly his first objective
9023376 we dont know how they are going to view the world when all of a sudden they are no longer on the sidelines telling people what to do but have to bear that burden themselves
9023377 this is sort of the pig in a poke quality of all presidential elections
9023378 the idea that senator mccain who sacrificed so much for his country would be anything less than extremely circumspect in ordering our men and women in uniform overseas is ridiculous
9023379 the use of military force is a last resort only when all other options have been exhausted and only if it is warranted by what we hope to achieve and what interests are at stake senator mccain has said repeatedly that he knows firsthand the costs of war and that he hates war

9023426 corporations focused on efficiencies and productivity started to make research more short term and tailored to the companys needs
9023427 with the result that most research done at corporations now is applied research
9023428 if you look at problems in the energy sector today we could have used the seeds and investments in that field from years ago
9023429 if you go back to the original days of bell labs and xerox parc they worked with universities in a very open collaborative way
9023430 they were part of the research community if you look at corporate research in the past few years it has become more about research for the companys good than the good of the ecosystem
9023431 there are a few foundations out there that fund basic science research but a lot more is for applied causes such as education or getting medicines to those who need them
9023432 it would be nice if all these institutions looked into their portfolio and gave just 10 of their overall allocation for research
9023433 companies say they are doing research and development but it is mostly development and very little research
9023434 research at microsoft is very well led though it is still bound to the areas that are of interest to the company

9023451 not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
9023452 the choice of palin is a statement about how badly he mccain wants former hillary supporters to join him
9023453 i dont think hell pick up any hillary supporters that was a weak choice

9023455 he mccain could have taken john thune mitt romney or tim pawlenty and been better off

9023459 russia is extremely cheap and most of the growth dynamics are still in place
9023460 if i look forward 12 months i want to own russia
9023461 if there is a perception of russia as a risky place or as an undesirable place to invest then the damage will be more long term
9023462 it will restrict the development of the economy and hurt the governments plans to create a more diversified the economy
9023463 it is big aggressive undemocratic and irresponsible georgia who took small and innocent south ossetia

9023505 differences over religion cannot be blamed for these crimes we are distressed at the defiance of law and order by hindu fundamentalist leaders and their public comments which are spreading lies and hate their unpardonable excuse is that followers are uncontrollably angry about christian conversions in the region
9023506 we are also deeply troubled by the state and central governments inadequate response the fact that identical attacks happened in the same area exactly nine months ago is unbelievable what will convince authorities to protect human rights and enforce constitutional guarantees
9023507 we apprised him of the situation and requested emergency deployment of the army compensation for the victims rebuilding of houses and churches construction of relief camps and restoration of the rule of law
9023508 udit raj a major dalit leader and other non christian human rights activists clearly explained that the violence in orissa is not because christians are fraudulently converting people that allegation is simply lie and hate propaganda

9023522 governor palin brings another strong pro life voice to the republican ticket in sharp contrast to the pro abortion ticket of barack obama and joe biden
9023523 americas hottest governor wildly popular shes more than just a pretty face
9023524 she spends as little time in the governors mansion as possible and spends time in her own home she likes to go out running by herself she projects a really down to earth persona
9023525 she seemed to hit the ground running and is massively popular
9023526 shes a great public speaker i think people are going to like her shes a young attractive face and shes always smiling
9023527 he has done what senator obama refused to do pick a qualified woman to be his running mate
9023528 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9023529 the last month and a half of john mccains campaign has resolved any doubts people had about his candidacy
9023530 obama is having to prove to people the unprovable he has been a community organizer and has been in the u s senate for 17 months before running for president hes not experienced enough to be president
9023531 republicans went to washington to change washington and instead washington changed them

9023549 the unanimous vote by the planning commission to conditionally approve our plan though non binding was a decisive step forward for this project
9023550 we are grateful to the planning commissioners for their input we tried to do everything they asked and we re pleased that they responded positively to our plan we look forward to being back in front of them soon to finalize the plan montecito has waited a long time for the miramar to come back and we want to deliver it
9023551 we heard you loud and clear at our last meeting
9023552 our goal from the very beginning has been to build a great hotel that the community can embrace
9023553 this latest round of changes continues that process and we re pleased that the commissioners responded positively we have responded to all of their requests and we are hopeful that on october 8th we will receive final approval for our project
9023554 by creating a network in the united states and linking it to the enterprise europe network we will significantly enhance transatlantic innovation and trade initiatives

9023560 who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people who are counting on us
9023561 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9023562 there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain
9023563 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9023564 he is willing to take a risk and put it all up on the line i think the republican base will be pleased by this
9023565 this the most out of the box pick in a very long time
9023566 it says to me that the mccain camp believes the democratic convention was a success for the democrats they cannot afford to play it safe

9023573 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
9023574 this is what we call a kinsleyan gaffe a mistake that reveals the truth john mccains health care plan is by the admission of his own advisers not particularly interested in the problem of the uninsured it doesnt try and cover them or address their plight and for a very simple reason conservatives in general are not interested in the problem of the uninsured

9023577 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
9023578 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
9023579 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
9023580 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders
9023581 the new data fit well with the previous results in mice because improved neurological status is likely to go along with increased communication between brain cells
9023582 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
9023583 our ultimate goal is to develop interventions that we can apply after a traumatic brain injury to improve outcomes and reduce the long term risk of alzheimers
9023584 i just want to finish the season have fun and win the races

9023596 this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9023597 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9023598 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9023599 there will be no pregame festivities and fans are encouraged to leave the stadium after the game as expeditiously as possible

9023601 traffic contraflow could begin through baton rouge as early as 6 p m saturday local time
9023602 ten a m is obviously not the optimal time for a football game
9023603 but when one of the options was not to play the game at all this is a matter of making the best of an unfortunate situation
9023604 i want to emphasize that our first concerns will have to be our peoples safety

9023609 i believe in the strength and the power of women and the potential of every human life she said
9023610 it is unprecedented to see the platforms of both major u s political parties incorporate key pieces of ffls unique message
9023611 of course there is a certain excitement about the recent movement toward ffls woman centered solutions and message by the parties and now the selection of a pro life feminist as the vice presidential nominee but as a nonpartisan organization we cannot endorse any candidates
9023612 ffl members represent a broad political as well as religious spectrum and we remain both nonpartisan and nonsectarian there are many issues outside feminists for lifes mission feminists for life is dedicated to systematically eliminating the root causes that drive women to abortion primarily lack of practical resources and support through holistic woman centered solutions we recognize that abortion is a reflection that our society has failed to meet the needs of women and that too often women have settled for less women deserve better than abortion
9023613 we invite all parties all public servants and all people to join us on the bridge of woman centered solutions

9023685 the selection of governor palin is tremendous she is an incredible asset the mccain palin ticket is big on results
9023686 when you look at the actual pair of mccain and palin they are the true mavericks
9023687 i think it is great that she is a vandal
9023688 i think it is fantastic being from the nw there is a sense of kinship it is a tight bond
9023689 but at the end of the day when it comes down to the issues of energy and government spending palin will help the everyday lives of washingtonians gov palin actually has a record in office of shaking things up
9023690 i dont want to vote for a rock star i want somebody who is going to take care of the issues
9023691 when elected to congress i appointed the first female sheriff to succeed me in the king county sheriffs office
9023692 so today im very pleased and encouraged to see the first female gop candidate for vice president this sets exactly the right example for our young women who we must continually empower and encourage to pursue positions of leadership both professionally and politically
9023693 ms palin has demonstrated the ability to succeed both as a working mother of five children as well as a leader of the state of alaska she clearly understands the importance of working in a bipartisan fashion and has reached across the aisle to work with democrats and republicans alike i wish her all the best
9023694 i dont want to vote for a rock star i want somebody who is going to take care of the issues
9023695 i dont want to vote for a rock star i want somebody who is going to take care of the issues
9023696 sarah palin brings to the republican ticket a unique and important perspective that is grounded in her role as a wife mother of five governor and someone who isnt afraid to shake up the status quo
9023697 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington dc does business as an outsider governor palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform she will bring that same focus to washington dc
9023698 i dont want to vote for a rock star i want somebody who is going to take care of the issues
9023699 experience is being taken off the table considering youre putting someone within a heartbeat of the presidency with the thinnest foreign policy experience in history

9023810 even if the veoh decision were to be considered by other courts that case does nothing to change the fact that youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners google and youtube have engaged in massive copyright infringement conduct that is not protected by any law including the dmca
9023811 here veoh has simply established a system whereby software automatically processes user submitted content and recasts it in a format that is readily accessible to its users veoh preselects the software parameters for the process from a range of default values set by the thirdparty software butveoh does not itself actively participate or supervise the uploading of files nor does it preview or select the files before the upload is completed instead video files are uploaded through an automated process which is initiated entirely at the volition of veohs users

9023936 im a united states senator because in 1848 a group of courageous women and a few brave men gathered in seneca falls new york many traveling for days and nights to participate in the first convention on womens rights in our history and so dawned a struggle for the right to vote that would last 72 years handed down by mother to daughter to granddaughter and a few sons and grandsons along the way these women and men looked into their daughters eyes and imagined a fairer and freer world and found the strength to fight to rally to picket to endure ridicule and harassment and brave violence and jail and after so many decades 88 years ago on this very day the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote became enshrined in our constitution my mother was born before women could vote my daughter got to vote for her mother for president this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up
9023937 to serve as vice president beside such a man would be the privilege of a lifetime and its fitting that this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote i think i think as well today of two other women who came before me in national elections i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course senator hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all

9023967 how ironic that on his 72nd birthday mccain has raised the question of whether his running mate is prepared to be commander in chief and lead the country
9023968 savour that frozen margarita in your hand for soon you might not be able to afford it mexicos tequila industry is about to become the latest victim of americas growing thirst for ethanol soaring demand for biofuel has sent global commodity prices through the roof prompting farmers of blue agave the cactus like plant from which the countrys national spirit is made to move into more lucrative cash crops such as wheat and corn
9023969 nearly one third of americans still believe there is no solid scientific evidence for climate change no no one disputes climate is changing and always has and half of those believe that scientists are still debating the issue
9023970 how this has come to be who is behind this campaign to claim there is scientific disagreement
9023971 we know where the money is coming from we know this has been funded by a mix of sources including the fossil fuel industry and particularly the coal industry
9023972 it is based on getting scientists to challenge scientists on anything that challenges the free market system
9023973 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency holy governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9023974 gustav could become a major hurricane before reaching western cuba
9023975 with both crude and total oil product inventories running significantly lower than they were when either hurricanes katrina or rita sidelined gulf oil production both oil and gasoline prices are more exposed to potential storm related supply disruptions than they were three years ago
9023976 a comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to new record highs with pump prices in the united states rising to us 5 per gallon and send natural gas prices spiking as well
9023977 the question is whether demand destruction can keep pace with the destruction in supply
9023978 while supply disruptions and attendant price hikes will be temporary there will be lasting impacts from hurricane damage on future supply growth as there have already been from the 2005 storm season
9023979 the general trend to gasoline prices would be flat to slightly lower reflecting a sort of underlying slowing global growth and therefore a slowdown in demand for crude oil
9023980 that should take a further froth off crude oil prices and allow for gasoline prices to slip a bit further
9023981 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon

9024014 it is not sure that her sentimental attachment to ltte has reduced and she will not again indulge in unlawful act to support their cause
9024015 the degree of criminality is not only causing the death of a former prime minister of a nation but also one of causing grave social unrest shock and turmoil in the psyche of each and every indian the authorities rightly have kept these matters in mind at arriving at a decision of not permitting premature release of the petitioner

9024026 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
9024027 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
9024028 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
9024029 this may have stifled efforts at developing newer and better vaccines especially for use in the elderly

9024031 in the meeting of latin american cardiologists we will offer participants the possibility to have their eye tested for early changes of radiation effect that may lead to cataract in future years
9024032 this will allow us to assess retrospectively what radiation dose these cardiologists received and then correlate the data with changes in their lens hopefully this will help them protect themselves better in the future and reduce further radiation in their eyes while maintaining the clinical load
9024033 we started training courses for cardiologists in 2004 and so far cardiologists from more than 50 countries have been trained in radiation protection

9024048 we recognize that service providers have to manage their networks but they must do so in way that addresses the issue that has come to their attention and that approach must be narrowly tailored
9024049 in the past there was clearly a cap but it was invisible users would know they had violated the cap only when they received a letter saying they were using the network excessively

9024101 our main objectives for www calibration gas com were two fold one we needed to ensure a broad range of products were available to end users second the site must be easy to navigate and to use this is not an easy task considering we offer hundreds of variations of available products
9024102 we worked closely with customers to obtain their ideas during the developmental stage of the new calibration gas website and we think we did a good job in achieving our objectives
9024103 this is the next logical phase for our organization providing gas detection equipment will allow our customers to consolidate vendors and accountability down to a single knowledgeable reliable vendor our highly trained staff members can provide technical support that is not available through the large distribution channels that try to provide a very broad selection of products and manufacturers these unfocused distribution channels often offer little or no expertise to back up the products these items are there to protect the life of workers guessing about the best product for an application is not an option for us

9024118 were facing a far more balanced market than we did last year
9024119 buyers can afford to be in less of a hurry
9024120 people are putting their homes on the market to take advantage of recent price gains
9024121 when you have double digit price gains on a nationwide basis for several years youre going to have to pay a little bit of that back at some stage
9024122 the trend for new listings generally national and major market reflects recent price trends
9024123 while still elevated new listings in alberta are easing and market balance is stabilizing now that prices there have softened
9024124 thats one of the reasons you have fewer buyers this year just from an affordability standpoint
9024125 looking to move out of real estate at the tailend of a very healthy ride
9024126 we expect that new listings will remain elevated for the rest of the year
9024127 the significant price gains that we saw last year are definitely in the rear view mirror theyll be very modest over the rest of the year and into next
9024128 with the economy still fundamentally on sound ground we dont expect to see the massive layoffs that we saw in the recession of the early 1990s

9024130 we dont expect the canadian market have similar trends to those in the u s

9024138 nintendo makes money with the hardware alone which may be a superior business model but the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us

9024151 to me this is a challenge when a certain person in the boxing industry hbos larry merchant first mentioned this it stuck in my head yes i am older and bigger and yes he is younger and stronger when freddie roach said manny pacquiao the fighter i trained can beat you it started to become personal to me to me its a challenge because people are talking about manny pacquiao can beat me well we will see on dec 6
9024152 this fight will really be a difficult fight for me but i know some people say it is a very easy fight for oscar but you know what i always do my job in the ring to give a good fight i think i can beat de la hoya i saw his last match and i think i am faster and stronger than him and i am younger also i believe i can beat him in the way that i beat david diaz in my last fight my speed oscar does have a height advantage but i believe i am stronger than him it is going to be a great fight on dec 6
9024153 i support your efforts to keep max at zach so that he can thrive surrounded by family and familiar faces
9024154 he lived in a bubble at first but when we got the diagnosis we went into ultra bubble
9024155 any cold can turn into pneumonia that he wont make it through
9024156 i thought i can be selfish and keep him locked up in a bubble or i can take a risk and let him live
9024157 he spent the first five years of his life surviving now hes living

9024160 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9024161 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me it has always been my dream to play for this team
9024162 my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games

9024165 i met robertson davies through the diaries of samuel marchbanks i read them in the 1950s and thought marchbanks was a curmudgeonly old man but when he wrote marchbanks davies wasnt old and he wasnt really curmudgeonly at all
9024166 a perfect orgy of self doubt shattered hopes unfulfilled ambitions and general misery
9024167 if i am ever going to make a mark other than a rather local and tiny one i had better get busy and do it

9024172 avete udito il richiamo e siete dunque giunti fratelli molti cicli si sono susseguiti per grazia della madre da quando chiesi a voi tutti e ai nostri confratelli che posano i loro scalzi piedi sul suolo ardano di spargerci su tutta ardania come piccoli semi per portare nuovo vigore e linfa allordine affinch la madre goda dei nostri servigi devo ringraziare voi tutti miei cari fratelli per il minuzioso lavoro che avete svolto insinuandovi come piccoli ruscelli che arrivano a scavare persino la nuda roccia
9024173 non a caso prima ho parlato di semi delloscuro e faticoso lavoro che avete compiuto in questi lunghi mesi abbiate fiducia perch i frutti non tarderanno a giungere non soffermatevi a guardare il presente non tenete lo sguardo basso alzatelo e volgetelo allorizzonte
9024174 vi chiedete forse il motivo per cui siete qui potrei dirvi semplicemente che il mio incarico di traghettare lordine in questo periodo buio arrivato al termine difatti sono qui perch i tempi sono ormai maturi affinch rinnovata linfa scorra ad alimentare il nostro ordine ho udito le parole della madre ed ho meditato a lungo su esse ella mi ha parlato con voce soave indicadomi chiaramente chi sar a succedermi
9024175 che la freschezza e la bellezza di questo dono della madre possa accompagnarti da adesso in poi in quello che forse ti potr apparire come un compito gravoso su di te si son posati gli occhi della madre e sarai tu a succedermi
9024176 at the moment it seems relatively benign but there are dangers lurking
9024177 will comcast count some traffic against the cap but not other traffic as in comcast generated video
9024178 we think 250 gb is an extremely large amount of bandwidth
9024179 a low bandwidth user downloading an hd movie at 8 p m in peak time puts more stress on the network than someone who downloads lots more in the middle of the night
9024180 if fewer than 1 percent would be affected by this whats the point
9024181 if they are going to put caps then they need to give us what i think is an acceptable expectation a meter
9024182 figure out a way to tell us what is our monthly usage and let us know if we are running up against a 250gb cap we know when to stop
9024183 if you believe the 0 05 kb e mail then you also believe in the tooth fairy
9024184 it remains unclear how the cap announced today helps solve comcasts supposed congestion problems
9024185 though the proposed cap is relatively high it will increasingly ensnare more users as technology continues its natural progression
9024186 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
9024187 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
9024188 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
9024189 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
9024190 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

9024200 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
9024201 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
9024202 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

9024222 doctor atomic came across as the most complex and inventive of mr adamss works an engrossing operatic drama even though very little happens yet by the end the entire world has changed forever
9024223 a radiant lyric soprano in a vulnerable and intense portrayal
9024224 mr ruggieros bail has been revoked and we have now charged him with bail jumping a misdemeanor charge
9024225 now it will be handled by our office in rockingham superior court
9024226 if the appeal is not accepted or if it is deemed waived because of his fleeing the state he will have to serve the sentence imposed
9024227 we were aware of the charges and have been following this closely since he was sentenced in new hampshire
9024228 and when he did not make it to his sentencing hearing we worked with new hampshire
9024229 the last couple of weeks weve had some good weather so weve been catching up
9024230 the only things were still behind on is paving but well get most of it done before snow flies
9024231 the idea is for kids to see there are athletes that work to do all these different kinds of athletic events
9024232 but its also a fun way for kids to enjoy beautiful local landmark and exercise
9024233 and the event is a great opportunity for parents and kids to exercise together and have a good time
9024234 henris brain injury has severely affected his ability to filter and process information his ability to take self protective measures his ability to exercise judgement and his short term memory ability
9024235 the accident left henri with major difficulties which are likely to persist for several years if not permanently
9024236 traumatic experience which quite expectedly has short circuited his ability to deal with various emotions
9024237 you can be a student filmmaker a professional or an amateur it doesnt matter
9024238 you can make it animated you can use live actors you can make a musical or you can make a silent movie all you have to be is very clever in 60 seconds
9024239 the filmmakers should concentrate on the more human aspects of this story how people can use their savings how they can better manage their household budgets what it means to them to lower their own price of gas
9024240 making a how to manual for the program would be fine but we want local artists to tap into the most emotional aspects of the story if they can
9024241 this is a great way to challenge the creativity of the filmmaking community
9024242 were always privileged to look at the amazing work coming out of the new england filmmaking community and this contest provides all our local filmmakers with yet another avenue to channel their energy and ideas
9024243 ladies and gentlmen in my estimation i think were ready for this threat
9024244 i want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so
9024245 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
9024246 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
9024247 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing

9024250 it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet
9024251 and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9024252 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9024253 that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
9024254 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
9024255 misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
9024256 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
9024257 companies are required to report incidents that happen to consumers be it a retailer or a manufacturer id urge all people to report injuries to cpsc in this case there is a very serious and real risk of strangulation from one of these bassinets
9024258 the company known as simplicity went into bankruptcy and the other company purchased their assets
9024259 they refused so we used some authority we have to put out a public warning parents and caregivers should not use these bassinets
9024260 legal representation for the poor has been an issue for a very long time but over the past decade the need for additional support for the poor and working poor has become more acute
9024261 in family court for example something like 75 percent of all cases involve at least one party who does not have an attorney often times these cases have fundamental rights such as custody of children at issue
9024262 he does pull more from democrats but not as much as people think
9024263 we dont know officially what he gave her it was something given to her in a beverage
9024264 anyone should contact state police or hampton falls police who has had contact with mr currier through most likely internet services
9024265 theatrical fantasy come to life beaux arts design for the 21st century
9024266 the new lobby will be a beautiful fantasy reflecting our sense of imagination and joy and showcasing our history in a theatrical way
9024267 the lobby will only enhance the wonderful experience our telluride by the sea patrons have come to expect with its charming mix of history salty air and film lovers portsmouth buzzes when telluride by the sea arrives
9024268 it seems most everything comes too late so nothing comes too late
9024269 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make
9024270 our vision is really toward zero deaths everyone counts so were not exactly celebrating these numbers
9024271 this is the first time hes come to our show and to have him select the fidelity investments jumper classic as a competition right after his huge success in the olympics is so exciting
9024272 its really a thrill for the audience to see these riders who have made international headlines in the sport of show jumping
9024273 i am ashamed of myself and i apologize to you
9024274 i have only been able for these past two years to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your masters house because of my flaws you have to do all of this work and you dont get full value from your efforts
9024275 as we return to the masters house i want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path
9024276 did you not notice that there were flowers only on your side of the path and not on the other pots side thats because i have always known about your flaw and i took advantage of it i planted flower seeds on your side of the path and every day while weve walked back from the stream youve watered them for two years i have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my masters table without you being just the way you are he would not have this beauty to grace his house
9024277 the main focus of the project is to revert the street into more of a residential setting
9024278 right now its heavily used as a cut through basically were changing it back to what its supposed to be
9024279 we hope it will solve the traffic and safety problems in our historic neighborhood
9024280 by highway standards its not much but by city standards its a big chunk of road
9024281 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9024282 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that governor palin is not qualified to be vice president she has a record of accomplishment that senator obama simply cannot match governor palin has spent her time in office shaking up government in alaska and actually achieving results whether its taking on corruption passing ethics reform or stopping wasteful spending and the bridge to nowhere senator obama has spent his time in office running for president
9024283 its just taking advantage of opportunities that seldom come your way
9024284 it being out of football in 2007 was actually a blessing
9024285 we were trying to get picks in the first round and he would ve been one of the guys in my mind i think he could be a good addition to an nba team because he s a glue guy
9024286 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me it has always been my dream to play for this team
9024287 my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9024288 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9024289 it has always been my dream to play for this team my goal is to show the coaches i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9024290 unbeknownst to the computer user redirected the users computer to the ebay web site without the user actually clicking on an ebay advertisement link or even becoming aware that they had left the page they were previously viewing as a result the ebay site would be prompted to drop an ebay cookie on the users computer even though the user never clicked on an ebay advertisement or even realized that their computer had ever visited the ebay site
9024291 once the cookie was stuffed on the users computer by one or more of the defendants any future revenue actions initiated by that user when the user later visited ebay intentionally and not as a result of any advertisement places by defendants appeared to be eligible for commissions payable to one of the defendants
9024292 sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
9024293 they hit the ball they made good swings but a lot of their hits were finding holes and thats what happens when youre behind in the count and youre using soft stuff
9024294 i feel like i have good enough movement and good enough command on my fastball to use it more than i did in the first two innings and i knew that was the only way i was going to get in a rhythm and thats what i did from the third inning on
9024295 i thought he threw the ball really well tonight and obviously he got the win for us and thats what we needed he gave us five innings he got up to around 90 pitches and he did everything that we asked him to do
9024296 definitely be aggressive my command i feel has been really good and i can go out there and throw strikes thats how ive done it in the past and i feel like just because ive gone through this surgery and gone through some setbacks in the past its all in the past and im just going to try to step in where i left off
9024297 es una muestra de los nuevos tiempos que estamos viviendo en nuestro continente de cambio de construcci n en nuestro caso del socialismo
9024298 la oligarqu a quiere aplicar la misma t ctica en todos los pa ses lo mismo que hicieron en venezuela lo mismo que le hicieron a evo morales presidente de bolivia nos lo quieren hacer a nosotros
9024299 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
9024300 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
9024301 the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors
9024302 todas las pruebas todas las evidencias y todas versiones que recabe servir n para llevar la investigaci n ello determinar en alg n momento quien tuvo la culpa y quien no la tuvo
9024303 son una gu a pero se necesita tiempo no es tan r pido no se puede establecer con eso a los responsables no se puede hacer tan r pido
9024304 preparation for bad weather has been at the top of mind and we prepare for it all year
9024305 by the time they foreclosed on the house today shed be dead
9024306 what am i going to do with this house in other words you have to choose the best exit strategy the one that best meets your needs youll have to ask yourself questions like
9024307 i have a property i want to wholesale do you want to buy it
9024308 i work with a really big group of investors because your house needs a lot of work i have to bring them all out to see what repairs are needed and to see if theyre interested in the purchase of your property
9024309 i cant say that since this convention started i havent thought about it because i have
9024310 i want to see how close to 60 votes we can get in the senate what the committee structure is and how best i can use my time
9024311 i have a base its up and down the state the state is so big i think candidates misjudge california they think they can get in a bus and go around and see enough people you cant you need to be known you need to raise the money you need to have a combination of campaign organization support and programs
9024312 capaz de vencer o fc porto acima de tudo porque uma possibilidade real
9024313 n o h favorito o favorito nos ltimos anos sempre foi o fc porto porque que foi o que ganhou muitos campeonatos mas prefiro pensar que o benfica capaz de vencer o fc porto acima de tudo porque uma possibilidade real
9024314 tenho muita confian a nos meus jogadores pois t m feito um trabalho magn fico durante a semana e no s bado v o dar uma grande resposta n o quero que se entrem com muita press o mas com confian a pensado que somos uma equipa grande que est a crescer e que estamos altura de jogar com grandes oponentes
9024315 o sporting e o fc porto t m a equipa feita uma din mica ganhadora e o mesmo treinador enquanto n s trabalhamos para em pouco tempo reduzir essa dist ncia o jogo com o sporting foi muito desequilibrado t nhamos apenas uma semana a trabalhar juntos espero que s bado n o se verifique esse desequil brio
9024316 n o me parece que a press o seja t o grande os jogadores sabem que o importante a conta final e n o quando se perdem os pontos se no final da poca n o somarmos todos os pontos contra fc porto e sporting mas atingirmos os nossos objectivos tudo bem
9024317 durante a pr poca pens mos sempre que era importante ter um jogador com muita qualidade e penso que suazo cumpre esses requisitos um grande jogador que vem de uma grande equipa e as suas caracter sticas de velocidade remate e capacidade para criar espa os v o trazer ao benfica muitas alternativas
9024318 est convocado porque em qualquer caso todo o tempo bom para conviver conhecer companheiros e ter uma ideia mais pr xima do que o benfica
9024319 n o h tempo para muito mais e penso que o plantel est fechado mas vamos esperar pelas pr ximas horas para ver o que vai acontecer
9024320 para lateral direito temos o maxi pereira e o miguel vitor um jogador forte que tamb m pode fazer a posi o e se quisermos um mais ofensivo temos o ruben amorim que alinhou a no belenenses em algumas partidas uma situa o que se pode compensar sem jogadores espec ficos para essa posi o
9024321 cardozo um jogador muito importante que est a realizar um trabalho importante e duro n o perde import ncia com a chegada de outros jogadores
9024322 having the critical habitat provides a stronger set of protection for the species and to ensure that its not just about the survival of individuals but recovery for the species as a whole
9024323 we did our best in 2001 but weve come a long ways in terms of mapping and how we refined our criteria for what is considered essential habitat
9024324 there are huge development pressures but also why people move there is for the beauty of the natural landscape
9024325 if we cant keep areas that allow the bighorn sheep to live what are we going to have but barren hillsides
9024326 gorillas hearts are unexpectedly almost identical to humans in size and shape
9024327 it would be difficult to distinguish a human heart from a gorillas just by a cardiac ultrasound
9024328 we chose that location because its central its easily accessible its highly visible
9024329 we still believe its the best permanent home for the clock but inevitably when you put anything a piece of sculpture a countdown clock in a public place you take a certain amount of risk so the best you can do is manage that
9024330 is improper visual communication with the jury it allows him to convey his occupation and a sense of responsibility and credibility to the jury without him having to take the stand
9024331 would be presenting himself in the same clothing he wears in the community every day
9024332 why distinguish between a nice business suit and a uniform if the guys in the service
9024333 right back where he started he came from nothing no family no positive influences
9024334 this is about bringing out the power that women have
9024335 that comes out of being more confident and more sexy
9024336 the activities deemed too provocative by adams township have become an increasingly popular form of exercise for women around the country and even in china a country not known for freedom
9024337 never offered for sale any sexually explicit material or sex toys during her classes
9024338 most of our patients who come in as trauma patients have been exposed to either a blast injury from an ied improvised explosive device or some other explosive event or a penetrating trauma from gunshot wounds or shrapnel or rpgs rocket propelled grenades or things like that
9024339 so we see amputations of arms and legs we see penetrating trauma to the belly or the chest and because we are also the neurosurgical capability for all of rc regional command south we see a lot of head trauma here as well and that again is also blunt trauma blast trauma as well as penetrating trauma from gunshot wounds
9024340 for the month of july for all of the reporting facilities we had the highest number of casualties coming into our facility
9024341 there are increased numbers of afghan national army ana and afghan national police casualties which would from my perspective be attributable to their increased role in operations
9024342 i have a hard time saying there is any success or anything positive related to casualties but i would say its attributable to the fact that they the afghans are doing their job better they are going places they never would have gone before and taking a lead role that they would not have taken before
9024343 if our hospital is full we have to transfer patients out
9024344 these are the innocent people of any war and its very traumatizing on a lot of nursing staff and the clinicians that are looking after kids on a daily basis
9024345 but these are medical professionals that know how to look after patients whether those patients are here or back home
9024346 we need to monitor all our personnel related costs to make sure we are managing our resources well
9024347 at the same time overtime in many cases is required to ensure the continuity of our service to the public such as dealing with hospital or safety emergencies or other situations where it makes more sense economically to pay someone overtime than to hire additional permanent staff
9024348 in the long run it would be more economically sound not to have that overtime bump
9024349 overtime should be an exception it should not be the rule
9024350 to get a tax deduction you would have to be working at home full time

9024373 takes a surprising turn away from what the conservative press would expect from head and his spiritual awakening and takes an in your face gritty but very honest look at the depths to which individuals will go to satisfy their drug alcohol addictions or other vices wrapped with footage of real life stories and overlayed with other innuendo heads performance steals the picture and will answer anyones questions as to whether he can still rock as hard or harder than his earlier days in korn the literal message in the final screen will get viewers thinking long and hard about any pre conceived judgments they have about those in society typically viewed as losers
9024374 save me from myself how i found god quit korn kicked drugs and lived to tell my story
9024375 right now weve got an in store record store tour

9024382 our survey reveals a wide gap between the perception homeowners have about their own homes value and the realities of a market in which three quarters of homes declined in value in the past year we attribute this gap to a combination of inattention and a fair bit of denial that causes people to believe their home is insulated from the woes of the market that affect others but not them

9024384 john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars on his shoes but were the ones who will pay for his flip flops
9024385 do you think that american diplomats should be operating the way they have in the past working with the palestinian government if hamas is now in charge
9024386 theyre the government sooner or later we are going to have to deal with them one way or another and i understand why this administration and previous administrations had such antipathy towards hamas because of their dedication to violence and the things that they not only espouse but practice so but its a new reality in the middle east i think the lesson is people want security and a decent life and decent future that they want democracy fatah was not giving them that
9024387 i think its very clear who hamas wants to be the next president of the united states so apparently has danny ortega and several others i think that people should understand that i will be hamass worst nightmare if senator obama is favored by hamas i think people can make judgments accordingly
9024388 we want to take senator mccain at his word that he wants to run a respectful campaign but it is becoming increasingly difficult when he continually tries to use the politics of association and makes claims he knows not to be true to advance his campaign this type of politics of division and distraction not only lead to a campaign not worthy of the american people but also has failed to help our families for too long
9024389 senator obama has repeatedly rejected and denounced the actions of hamas a terrorist organization responsible for the deaths of many innocents that is dedicated to israels destruction as president obama will work with israel to isolate terrorist groups like hamas target their resources and support israels right and capability to defend itself from any attack
9024390 this is a legitimate issue for the american people to think about
9024391 it is not only responsible to raise these critical issues in this election but it would be the height of irresponsibility not to have this discussion with the american people

9024539 it is most surprising and entirely inexplicable that a senior counsel appearing for the ministry of petroleum and natural gas has made a gratuitous and uncalled for statement with regard to the merit of ntpcs case against reliance industries when the ministry of petroleum and natural gas is not a party and is in no way concerned with the said suit

9024556 we are thrilled to partner with the government of tanzania in the establishment of these new childrens centers of excellence we are deeply grateful to pepfar and to the u s agency for international development and centers for disease control and prevention teams for all of their support as well as to the generous private donors that made all of this possible
9024557 the clinic fulfills a critical need in tanzania where the abbott fund has been working in partnership with the government for more than a decade to improve health care not only for people with hiv but also for those with other chronic health issues
9024558 the construction of the first pediatric clinic in tanzania with our longstanding partner bipai marks another critical step in the abbott funds ongoing commitment to addressing the health of children with hiv
9024559 the bristol myers squibb foundations secure the future program and its successful pediatric initiative with the baylor college of medicine and texas childrens hospital is grounded in the concept of public private partnership
9024560 this new commitment from the united states government to enhance pediatric care and support of children in partnership with the government of tanzania and bipai will leverage and multiply the impact of the private sector support
9024561 dan and i are so happy for the many children who will be helped by these two new childrens centers in tanzania
9024562 i attended a presentation mark kline gave in houston last year and was very impressed with the impact of the program what a blessing the new clinics will be in the lives of so many
9024563 it is a privilege to partner with bipai and dr kline to bring compassionate life saving care and treatment to the most vulnerable population fighting hiv aids the children

9024951 shes has grit integrity a good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that we need in washington today
9024952 she knows where she comes from and knows who she works for
9024953 she will stand up for whats right and doesnt let anyone to tell her to sit down
9024954 exactly who i need and who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9024955 stop wasteful spending and cut property taxes and put people first
9024956 as governor i stood up to lobbyists big oil and the good old boy network
9024957 the right reason is to challenge the status quo and serve the common good
9024958 you could have knocked me over with a feather with this one
9024959 what are we doing and is there where we want to go
9024960 theres a real solid base for the band in america
9024961 and quite honestly if you can sell a couple of hundred thousand records you make a lot more money than when you sell a million records for the record company
9024962 theres a grand mystique with the verve and it continues to this day
9024963 with the changes that happened at virgin over the years he felt he didnt have a connection there any longer
9024964 me and richard go way back so he called me one day and said why dont we go full circle we made that swap and worked on his last solo album then they re formed the band and it still felt like the natural home for the same reasons
9024965 like oasis and the best of the bands from the 90s the verve still resonate with the people who grew up with them and are older now in their late 20s or early 30s
9024966 but theres a whole wealth of teens that are discovering them heard those classics whether it be lucky man bitter sweet symphony this is music or history and probably thought theyd never get the chance to see this amazing band
9024967 i think the industry is smarter but its hard to say if its better prepared
9024968 if you think about an old car and you repair it its hard to make it better than new but you can make it close to new the question is is new good enough
9024969 if one major deep water production platform is destroyed youre talking about a 1 billion or more loss

9024972 snap on is very committed to supporting the backbone of tomorrows workforce and the s tech site provides a unique opportunity to support and encourage tech students by giving them a way to connect with each other and with professionals in the field
9024973 raceway media brought valuable experience to the project with their background in developing vertical niche social networking sites with the launch of s tech todays tech students and technicians can now enjoy their very own online community
9024974 we placed a statement on the s tech homepage that really captures the essence of what we wanted the site to be for its users your site your network your future
9024975 our goal was to create a social network and destination website that would speak directly to this particular community and where they could create connections with other people who share their experiences interests and goals
9024976 for a guy who keeps pushing for more state influence in atlantic city senator whelan has been strangely silent on the citys efforts to facilitate the development of the revel project and the petition drive to stop it
9024977 when the city passed the ordinance john and i applauded the citys efforts when the petition started circulating john and i immediately said the petition was ill advised the state senator from this district should not remain silent when a 2 billion investment in our local economy is at risk
9024978 revel will employ 5 000 people once they complete construction why put those jobs at risk people are looking for work right now
9024979 with the gaming competition from other states the constant threat of vlts the delay of the pinnacle project and the general economic climate we should be looking for ways to spur economic development not delay it
9024980 the pattern of whelans failure to stand up for workers is disturbing
9024981 after being excoriated to the point of being labeled as incompetent and a coward by former senator gormley for his failure to stand up for the industry whelan ought to be more vocal now in protecting peoples jobs
9024982 two republican assemblymen have joined with six democrat city council members to do whats right for the working people of our area
9024983 there should be a bi partisan effort to fight for these jobs its just a shame that the senator has not joined the fight
9024984 running for president to fight for you to make government stand on your side not in your way

9025016 we think we have as good a front seven on defense as weve had in a long long time here
9025017 if you look across the board and were only looking at potential because we havent played a game this unit is probably pound for pound the strongest group weve ever had up front our front four averages over 400 pounds in bench pressing which is a major number in college however the teams depth and focus on moving forward was also reflected in murphys reaction is a player who was a starter a year ago on our nickel team ryan barnes as an example that will compete for that position quite frankly those guys need to come through and i have no question that they will
9025018 overall we think we have a chance to be a good team
9025019 the guys in the secondary have really taken a great attitude in terms of overall work ethic and their preparation that alleviates some of the pressure off the unit i have confidence and the coaches have confidence that these younger players will be able to step into these roles theyre going to do well

9025190 not necessarily i dont think that necessarily proves that you are on form or not a good solid performance does nowadays in europe if you finish from 10th up you are performing quite well because it is tough to win and you have to be fortunate at the right times

9025204 capaz de vencer o fc porto acima de tudo porque uma possibilidade real
9025205 n o h favorito o favorito nos ltimos anos sempre foi o fc porto porque que foi o que ganhou muitos campeonatos mas prefiro pensar que o benfica capaz de vencer o fc porto acima de tudo porque uma possibilidade real
9025206 tenho muita confian a nos meus jogadores pois t m feito um trabalho magn fico durante a semana e no s bado v o dar uma grande resposta n o quero que se entrem com muita press o mas com confian a pensado que somos uma equipa grande que est a crescer e que estamos altura de jogar com grandes oponentes
9025207 o sporting e o fc porto t m a equipa feita uma din mica ganhadora e o mesmo treinador enquanto n s trabalhamos para em pouco tempo reduzir essa dist ncia o jogo com o sporting foi muito desequilibrado t nhamos apenas uma semana a trabalhar juntos espero que s bado n o se verifique esse desequil brio
9025208 n o me parece que a press o seja t o grande os jogadores sabem que o importante a conta final e n o quando se perdem os pontos se no final da poca n o somarmos todos os pontos contra fc porto e sporting mas atingirmos os nossos objectivos tudo bem
9025209 durante a pr poca pens mos sempre que era importante ter um jogador com muita qualidade e penso que suazo cumpre esses requisitos um grande jogador que vem de uma grande equipa e as suas caracter sticas de velocidade remate e capacidade para criar espa os v o trazer ao benfica muitas alternativas
9025210 est convocado porque em qualquer caso todo o tempo bom para conviver conhecer companheiros e ter uma ideia mais pr xima do que o benfica
9025211 n o h tempo para muito mais e penso que o plantel est fechado mas vamos esperar pelas pr ximas horas para ver o que vai acontecer
9025212 para lateral direito temos o maxi pereira e o miguel vitor um jogador forte que tamb m pode fazer a posi o e se quisermos um mais ofensivo temos o ruben amorim que alinhou a no belenenses em algumas partidas uma situa o que se pode compensar sem jogadores espec ficos para essa posi o
9025213 cardozo um jogador muito importante que est a realizar um trabalho importante e duro n o perde import ncia com a chegada de outros jogadores
9025214 juneau alaska in two short years sarah palin moved from small town mayor with a taste for mooseburgers to the governors office and now
9025215 shes got the grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9025216 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down shes fought oil companies and party bosses and do nothing bureaucrats and anyone who puts their interests before the people of whom she swore an oath to serve
9025217 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9025218 knows what its like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries
9025219 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
9025220 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9025221 an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table
9025222 governor sarah palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energize social conservatives
9025223 it clearly makes it more difficult for mccain to criticize obamas experience
9025224 the company informed the airport of the possibility of replacing the aircraft but eventually decided to stick with the aircraft
9025225 i just want to finish the season have fun and win the races

9025228 i was struggling with that stroke but i managed to win at the end so that is the most important thing
9025229 i felt i had some chance but she had lots of heart
9025230 i played sometimes so well but then i made mistakes
9025231 i was not too bad i tried to go to the volley and put pressure on her but i felt my serve was not good i double faulted too much
9025232 i have no idea how she played what the other girl did i have no idea i only heard it on the news
9025233 so many advantages you know from her side and i also had i dont know how many match points
9025234 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9025235 shes fought oil companies and party bosses and do nothing bureaucrats and anyone who puts their interests before the people of whom she swore an oath to serve
9025236 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9025237 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9025238 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9025239 i would rather hear you say that at the end of the trial rather than the beginning
9025240 and now that im talking to you i feel blood freezing in my veins
9025241 in my mind i saw my son my husband and 22 members of my family that were killed in srebrenica
9025242 may i hold you to your word that i am not guilty
9025243 i sincerely hope you are not serious about that date

9025245 afecta la seguridad del ecosistema del valle del huasco por el riesgo de la contaminaci n a pesar de los largos estudios que dicen seg n las autoridades regionales que est n cubiertos todos los posibles flancos de riesgo

9025247 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
9025248 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
9025249 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
9025250 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
9025251 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n
9025252 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
9025253 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap siguen las protestas contra la transnacional canadiense barrick gold y el estado chileno por el conflicto pascua lama leer mas aqu
9025254 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9025255 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9025256 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9025257 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9025258 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9025259 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9025260 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9025261 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
9025262 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
9025263 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9025264 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9025265 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
9025266 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
9025267 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
9025268 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
9025269 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9025270 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
9025271 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
9025272 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
9025273 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9025274 nunca los ej rcitos chileno y argentino han demostrado mayor grado de cooperaci n y fraternidad que durante la pacificaci n de la araucan a que los argentinos conocen como
9025275 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
9025276 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
9025277 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9025278 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
9025279 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
9025280 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9025281 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9025282 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9025283 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9025284 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
9025285 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
9025286 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo

9025289 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
9025290 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9025291 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
9025292 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9025293 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
9025294 at our district weve been seen a lot of incremental growth for years and were proud of that but who knows if thats going to be enough
9025295 some have different challenges than others so to expect every school to achieve at the same rate is unfair
9025296 let a democrat say that an executive with 2 years of experience and no foreign policy expertise isnt ready for the presidency oh pretty please because you know what im going to do im going to take that soundbite put it in an ad slap obamas mug up there and run it over and over and over again

9025299 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
9025300 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
9025301 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9025302 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9025303 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

9025306 a question for you would you rather bucknell make the ncaas once every 20 years or so and get ass raped by teams like kansas in the first round or have them drop down a rung to a confernce where they can compete for a title
9025307 we believe they tumbled or fell about 200 feet the child was described as seriously injured and the man less so
9025308 it was wet and slippy they were just below the cloud line around 2 000 feet up the mountain it is quite steep there

9025312 were pretty self sustaining now at least we dont have to go to metairie every time we need something

9025320 once he was so scared to go to school that mom had to get out of the carpool line and walk him in
9025321 he jumped out of the car and jumped back in and cried and ran to the back of the mini van
9025322 im a little bit happy and im a little bit nervous
9025323 well its really just fear of the unknown at that age
9025324 there may be some fear sometimes of just not having a security person a parent or a sibling nearby that they can count on
9025325 if youre uptight about it if youre worried about it clearly your children will pick up on it and that will escalate their anxiety and fear
9025326 its just that in the morning when he separates from mom thats a moment of going from total safeness to a little bit of an unknown and thats just a hard thing to do
9025327 got a little picture of my mom and dad in my pocket
9025328 we like to bring the best to our clients and make sure they get the best and safest service
9025329 if your feet ache you ache all over we must take care of our body because we only have one body and my job is to protect clients the community can feel very comfortable and be assured they are safe
9025330 i think every woman at a certain age needs a little tweaking
9025331 its not self indulgent especially when you work with the public and put your face forward its the first thing people see and remember
9025332 it just felt a little more firm but soft and supple there was nothing harsh about it
9025333 overall its a much better procedure than surgery by far
9025334 that was not anything we opposed but it did raise some sort of economic concerns
9025335 if you lived in those times a common understanding of interracial communities was formed on the basis of older communities that had typically been all white but were now in the process of becoming racially integrated but because the white families didnt want to they began to sell their houses in rapid succession which drove prices down a common view was that if you bought a house in a racially divided community you were going to lose property value
9025336 whenever a house would go on sale the real estate brokers in town would be very apprehensive
9025337 there was an anxiety that instead of maintaining our integrity as a mixed race community it would tend to go towards a not mixed community and most likely an all black community
9025338 the high school students in keeping with their typical volatility we believe took it upon themselves essentially vandalizing the community from time to time particularly the home of this black teacher
9025339 racial prejudice still exists but its hard for people to understand what things were like in those days
9025340 during the early and late evenings two of us would essentially walk around the community on two hour shifts and take the license plate numbers of cars
9025341 those were the days when everyone had lots of kids
9025342 i have come to believe that living here is the most sublime experience one can have
9025343 i really feel excited and grateful to be here and touched by the way in which the entire community has developed
9025344 through serendipity or some inexplicable intervention people turned out to be more or less of similar instincts
9025345 that similar instinct was a desire to know other people to respect other people people different from you to learn from the communal experience and enjoy it i dont think anybody came with that high minded desire but thats what happened
9025346 they would either say they didnt know what it was or they would call it the gray community
9025347 it was a nuisance but it didnt happen often because at the same time there were two black taxi drivers who of course did not follow that course
9025348 they always assumed we were the servant of the household
9025349 we proved what the philosophy in the beginning was set out to prove that property values do not plummet when black people move into a neighborhood because our houses are going at the same rates as any other house at the same level in princeton and west windsor
9025350 what an incredible experience i think it was for our kids and a lot of others hopefully a lot of those kids with their kids and some with their grandkids will be here on september 6
9025351 south east asia has plummeted to levels it took europe 150 years to reach in just 30 years
9025352 the span of fertility across countries has never been wider
9025353 both extremes cause their own problems if europe continues at 1 5 the population will halve every 65 years if africa continues with half its population under 15 it will continue to consume more than it produces making it harder to escape from poverty and illiteracy
9025354 people are very bad at calculating survival probabilities twenty years ago fertility started to decline in nepal and bangladesh when they were still poor korea wasnt rich when fertility declined by contrast the gulf oil states continued with high birthrates long after they got huge wealth
9025355 in africa most women work in agriculture around the home
9025356 but in bangladesh women get out and meet other women at work who may be using contraception getting outside the home fixes a new social norm prosperity and fertility are interlinked in a chicken and egg way
9025357 food sex and procreation are core elements of humanity and changes to them are often met with fierce hostility
9025358 in my view the evidence is that there is something intrinsic to the culture its there in the rich muslim states in the gulf in saudi arabia and in the muslim provinces of the former soviet union it is perhaps bound up with the status of women
9025359 not just in catholic spain and italy but in orthodox greece the strong traditions are not boosting fertility rate as many might suppose
9025360 the desert nesting bald eagle population is highly threatened and entirely distinct from other bald eagle populations no recognized bald eagle expert disagrees
9025361 todays request affords indian people time to establish the populations significant historical presence before we lost 90 percent of the riparian areas it depends on
9025362 dont say that of course you were meant to have children
9025363 im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk
9025364 when its calvin klein and its steve meisel shooting you and you get to be a part of this amazing iconic brand and their legacy you just kind of go for it
9025365 the fragrance is an intoxicating floral oriental fragrance weaving together forbidden fruits exotic flowers and a sultry wood signature for a provocative and addictive sexiness
9025366 a pesar de que ellos dijeron quiero animaci n japonesa no es eso lo que ellos quieren realmente ellos quieren un h brido entre animaci n japonesa y animaci n occidental

9025369 building and deploying web scale social networking applications using php and oracle database
9025370 not everyone was texting each other and taking their phones everywhere and iming
9025371 what e mail has done to relationships i think it has ruined high school you used to have to go to a girl and talk to her they text now its a different world and all of that stuff is great for stories
9025372 were trying to make it reflective of what kids really do and what its really like
9025373 our version is a little dirtier and edgier but its also going to show that despite how much money these kids come from essentially they want to be popular and liked its all the same emotions whether you grew up working class in michigan or upper class in beverly hills
9025374 trust me your concerns about sachs judah doing 90210 are the same concerns everyones having including jeff and i
9025375 we were the first ones to go can we pull this off
9025376 there are so many things that are very important now that didnt exist eight years ago
9025377 when you look at the old show the characters look very outdated and the fashion is outdated so theres a new version to do but what i loved the most about redeveloping the show was having people from a different part of the country move to beverly hills and contemporizing that point of view
9025378 ive been doing this for a long time and ive never seen quite the amount of attention that this network has been getting from gossip girl and 90210
9025379 i think theres something to be said about being a part of pop culture right now and building assets for our parent companies theres got to be a new way of measuring viewers because our viewers are much younger and they consume content differently
9025380 were used to doing shows that a couple of years later people say oh i saw that on dvd and that it was really good
9025381 were not used to people knowing exactly what we did until two years after its been canceled
9025382 the old show was great because it put issues out there but the way that it handled it was very after school special
9025383 you had the walsh family always at home ready to listen to their problems and give them snacks in this show the parents have their own lives and their own drama and its just more realistic
9025384 you think its all glitz and glam and everybodys rich
9025385 but people have some secrets and they hide them you get to see the lives of real people and how they adapt to somewhere as beautiful and as ugly as beverly hills
9025386 gabe and jeff have so much to say about their own coming of age stories
9025387 its something they really enjoy writing and its evident in the script
9025388 i believe we now have the most pro life ticket in history running on the most pro life platform in history
9025389 its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9025390 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here
9025391 but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened
9025392 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9025393 its ok to let kids know that there are theories out there
9025394 my dad did talk a lot about his theories of evolution
9025395 he would show us fossils and say how old do you think these are
9025396 im not going to pretend i know how all this came to be
9025397 you never say its 5 25 or 5 47 only that its 5 something
9025398 well unless i have an appointment i dont need to know the exact time i know if its 6 something i should be making dinner if its 10 something i should be winding down for the night what do i care about the minutes
9025399 the presence of a pet dog can diminish stress responses to real life daily stress over which caregivers have no control
9025400 if gum is good and dogs are good what if i let my dog chew gum
9025401 although chewing gum products are not intended for use by dogs cats or other pets the american veterinary medical association avma has reported that xylitol an ingredient safe for people in some of wrigleys chewing gum may be toxic for dogs
9025402 if you still think you have a serious interest in becoming a doublemint twin think about getting a dog because you probably have a lot of anxiety
9025403 all employees of ferrari are extremely saddened by the passing of a man who gave so much to ferrari

9025463 im talking to little cousins that like yankee and all that and theyre starting to believe that john mccain is the best candidate i cant have that
9025464 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called yankee a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
9025465 if he believes john mccain is the better candidate for the latinos we could sit down even if he wants to get into a debate we can debate anywhere new york puerto rico
9025466 like i said with me my whole philosophy on blacks and latinos is were all one were in the same ghettos same inner cities and were suffering from the same problems every problem the blacks have the latinos have theres two systems of health care the one for the rich thats really good then theres the one for the inner city where they leave ladies in the emergency room unattended for 24 hours until they drop dead people dont even check on her hours after shes dead this is normal stuff this is whats happening in the u s

9025469 coming back into fashion south africa has been a favourite destination with property buying golfers for many years where else can you spot warthogs trotting down the fairway or having to watch out for crocodiles in the water hazards
9025470 there are about 450 golf courses in south africa and about 70 new courses under construction portugal for instance has just 56 courses although south africa is a long haul destination about 10 hours to johannesburg and 12 to cape town from the uk it is possible to have a long weekend there due to there being just two hours time difference adding to this the main language is english the weather is good all year round the scenery is stunning just about everywhere the food and wine outstanding and the rand at nearly 15 to the pound create a seriously wonderful destination new golfing resorts including fijnbosch pearl valley and oubaai are attracting a cosmopolitan property purchasing crowd with low golfing fees caddie rates estate charges and general cost of living all adding to the allure while these gated communities also offer excellent security
9025471 property at pezula represents great value when compared with top private estates in other countries around the world as the pound is currently so strong against the rand property values at pezula have risen steadily since the resort began with buyers in 2003 realising a 74 per cent return on their rand investment this is an exceptional opportunity for uk buyers to acquire a superb property with proven value

9025473 pain is a distracting and sometimes debilitating message from the nervous system to the brain that says somethings wrong and needs to be addressed
9025474 firemen turn off a distracting alarm system after they arrive on the scene of a blaze similarly after a bodys distress warning is activated then constant or reoccurring pain can create a vicious cycle that can cause inflammation and even interfere with the bodys healing process there are two categories of pain acute that which may have occurred in the last two or three days and chronic which is a long term and sometimes constant pain at pmca we help manage both types
9025475 do the ufo reports we have collected indicate that the earth is being visited by a people from another planet
9025476 so our present course of action is to continue on this problem with the best of our ability giving it the attention that we feel it very definitely warrants we will give it adequate attention but not frantic attention
9025477 the six term senator from delaware is strongest in areas where the freshman from illinois is weakest bidens tenure in the senate his foreign policy expertise his religion and his suburban middle class background all fill gaps in obamas own presidential profile
9025478 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both and you know i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher growing up with being so privileged and blessed to be given a lot of information on on both sides of the subject creationism and evolution its been a healthy foundation for me but dont be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides
9025479 i beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we cant drill our way out of our problem or that more supply wont ultimately affect prices of course it will affect prices
9025480 as i said recently in my state of the state address to the legislature under our present certificate of need process costs and needs dont drive health care choices bureaucracy does our system is broken and expensive eliminating the con program with certain exceptions will allow free market competition and reduce onerous government regulation

9025482 the property market in natal is in its relative infancy and the coastline is almost development free supply currently lags way below demand
9025483 new development is springing up alongside sporting and leisure facilities but the authorities are paying great attention to the environment before granting licenses aesthetics and stability are of greater importance to them than squeezing every last penny out of every last square metre
9025484 prices in natal are incredibly low right now but outside investment in infrastructure such as golf courses and a new airport will increase demand for property and inevitably trigger natural price hikes
9025485 being the closest part of brazil to europe thus drastically cutting down flying times to between seven and nine hours from most european cities natal has phenomenal beaches a permanent summer and with year round rental potential suits both audiences the pure investor and the holiday home hunter
9025486 the investment in the general infrastructure and tourism in the north east of brazil has been significant over the past few years and is set to continue for the foreseeable future
9025487 seek out that particular mental attribute which makes you feel most deeply and vitally alive along with which comes the inner voice which says this is the real me and when you have found that attitude follow it
9025488 when we have our body and mind in order everything else will exist in the right place in the right way but usually without being aware of it we try to change something other than ourselves we try to order things outside us but it is impossible to organize things if you yourself are not in order when you do things in the right way at the right time everything else will be organized

9025519 while there may be some controversy and concern surrounding its revenue guidance as it is more subdued than its customers and end markets indicate we believe its new cfo is choosing to err on the conservative side leaving room for future upside surprises
9025520 we would be buyers on weakness related to concerns around conservative sales guidance
9025521 we view mrvls guidance as conservative and see further upside to out eps estimates in the coming quarters
9025522 backlog growth of 5 sequentially suggest that managements top line guidance is overly conservative and we believe marvell management has put the company in a positive to easily exceed q3 guidance
9025523 management refused to address the issue other than to say it was being conservative given global macro issues
9025524 we recommend investors remain on the sidelines due to potential hdd inventory and material share loss at rim coupled with our belief that marvell no longer deserves a premium multiple give its high exposure to the maturing hdd market and weak cellular positioning
9025525 we continue to see headwinds to business over the next few quarters and we believe these are reflected in the companys relatively tepid revenue guidance we remain cautious on business in future quarters given potential hdd component inventory build share loss for key customer western digital wdc and pricing compression and second sourcing at rimm in 2009
9025526 we expect the stock to remain under pressure given concerns around the business outlook beyond the current quarter

9025533 the county should not enforce child support judgments it knows to be unfounded and in particular it should not ask the courts to assist it in doing so despite the clear directive that child support agencies not pursue mistaken child support actions the county persists in asking that we do so we will not sully our hands by participating in an unjust and factually unfounded result we say no to the county and we reverse

9025540 you can see and understand the businesses involved for example ships come into the port unload containers reload containers and leave
9025541 ten to 20 years from now infrastructure could be larger than real estate
9025542 woe is me china is going to crumble from 12 growth to gasp 7 the world is ending
9025543 paternity establishment is a prerequisite for obtaining a child support order
9025544 we hold given the legislative history behind chapter 248 that the legislature intended for blood or genetic tests to be made available upon a motion to any putative father seeking to challenge a paternity declaration previously entered against him in which such blood or genetic test evidence was not introduced moreover an examination of the best interests of the child has no place in that determination
9025545 hospitals urged to help find fathers effort is to reduce unpaid child support
9025546 once we find him well need to prove that he is your babys father one way is if he signed the birth certificate or an acknowledgment of paternity form at the hospital it will also help if you can provide letters in which he claims he is your babys father pictures of him with your baby diaries calendars mothers day or birthday cards or proof of any money he has given you or your baby if you have these items please bring them to our office
9025547 in most cases signing the form will make it easier to establish paternity in a court later
9025548 the division of child support enforcement does not represent either party in establishing visitation or custody rights however establishing paternity is the first step needed in order to ask a judge for visitation privileges the father will need to seek legal counsel for advice on visitation and or custody
9025549 no indebtedness warrants the suspension of the right to be free from compulsory service

9025554 shes fought oil companies and party bosses and do nothing bureaucrats and anyone who puts their interests before the people of whom she swore an oath to serve
9025555 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9025556 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9025557 shes got the grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today

9025559 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9025560 knows what its like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries
9025561 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
9025562 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9025563 an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table
9025564 governor sarah palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energize social conservatives
9025565 it clearly makes it more difficult for mccain to criticize obamas experience
9025566 the company informed the airport of the possibility of replacing the aircraft but eventually decided to stick with the aircraft

9025571 i felt i had some chance but she had lots of heart
9025572 i played sometimes so well but then i made mistakes
9025573 i was not too bad i tried to go to the volley and put pressure on her but i felt my serve was not good i double faulted too much
9025574 i have no idea how she played what the other girl did i have no idea i only heard it on the news
9025575 so many advantages you know from her side and i also had i dont know how many match points
9025576 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9025577 i would rather hear you say that at the end of the trial rather than the beginning
9025578 and now that im talking to you i feel blood freezing in my veins
9025579 in my mind i saw my son my husband and 22 members of my family that were killed in srebrenica

9025585 alaska needs to be self sufficient instead of relying heavily on federal dollars as the state does today
9025586 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
9025587 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9025588 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9025589 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9025590 we decided not to look backward we decided to look forward with all the progress weve made
9025591 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level
9025592 our inspectors are on site today theyll be there for three hours or 13 whatever is necessary
9025593 i think the tenants should be upset with their landlord
9025594 you can see here its just like a construction site theres construction going on
9025595 we have not yet come in and cleaned the walls ceilings and floors in the units
9025596 that will happen after re occupancy we have to be allowed back into the units by the tenants
9025597 the vast majority of passengers affected by the suspension of the airlines services should be able to secure alternative flights and will be entitled to refunds
9025598 it depends on your credit card company and the type of protection that you have
9025599 same thing if you bought your ticket through a registered travel agency specifically in ontario quebec and british columbia those provinces have protection funds in place for such situations
9025600 keep everything it could prove very very useful as evidence in support of any potential claim in the future if you are caught stranded abroad and you have to spend an extra night at a hotel and pay for additional meals keep those receipts as well if you have a conversation with someone at the desk write down the name the hour the date everything
9025601 we are trying to make as many passengers as possible aware of their options in terms of alternative flights and the possibility of securing refunds for the flights they booked with zoom
9025602 we have been in contact with other airlines including ba british airways virgin and flyglobespan in particular and they have made clear the availability of alternative flights
9025603 mats has been involved in united nations charities for quite a while
9025604 its a charity he likes he knows the people who are involved and so its something that makes sense to him
9025605 we want him to make sure hes 100 per cent either way so he should take his time
9025606 i believe in the positive power of sport and play for children in addition to keeping kids out of trouble and engaging them in a constructive activity sports teach children many lessons and values including teamwork and determination the festival cup is a great opportunity to help support the important initiatives of right to play
9025607 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
9025608 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

9025610 strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with gorbachev thats what nixon did with mao i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union at the time when they were saying were going to wipe you off the planet and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serio us threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world
9025611 the 2008 convention program will bring together americans who will speak to john mccains vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations we are excited about next week and we are looking forward to showcasing john mccains life long record of putting his country first

9025623 we went on a weeknight so it wasnt crowded and the service was good
9025624 it has been a pleasure to have you dine here
9025625 i think youre a nice guy but i dont think we should hang out please dont ever call me again
9025626 oh my god daddy look at that big thing that man is eating
9025627 not only am i attracted to him but also have a great feeling about him i hope he likes me
9025628 i am such a fan of their pan fried noodle dishes
9025629 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9025630 ok so after months of frequenting this place i decided to review it
9025631 thing turns me off maybe i am an old fashion
9025632 do you know what youre turning down this is very powerful medicine
9025633 what the hell is this guy doing in here he doesnt look very earthy
9025634 palin said last month that no woman should have to choose between her career education and her child
9025635 shes a member of a pro woman but anti abortion group called feminists for life i believe in the strength and the power of women and the potential of every human life she said
9025636 it is unprecedented to see the platforms of both major u s political parties incorporate key pieces of ffls unique message
9025637 of course there is a certain excitement about the recent movement toward ffls woman centered solutions and message by the parties and now the selection of a pro life feminist as the vice presidential nominee but as a nonpartisan organization we cannot endorse any candidates
9025638 ffl members represent a broad political as well as religious spectrum and we remain both nonpartisan and nonsectarian there are many issues outside feminists for lifes mission feminists for life is dedicated to systematically eliminating the root causes that drive women to abortion primarily lack of practical resources and support through holistic woman centered solutions we recognize that abortion is a reflection that our society has failed to meet the needs of women and that too often women have settled for less women deserve better than abortion
9025639 we invite all parties all public servants and all people to join us on the bridge of woman centered solutions
9025640 mezze in minneapolis a taste of the cuisine and culture of the arab world

9025644 ooo the dems are picking on a working mom how hypocritical
9025645 we deeply appreciate the assistance of everyone at these stations who is helping to facilitate our collection of potentially contaminated kerosene
9025646 we are doing everything we possibly can to ensure public safety during this recall and these collection centers are crucial to that effort
9025647 a presidential candidates first major executive decision is selecting a running mate and john mccains unexpected choice of sarah palin inspires real confidence that a mccain administration will be a strong ally in the pro life and pro family cause
9025648 governor palin is the most pro life vice presidential candidate ever to run we are thrilled with this choice
9025649 john mccain and sarah palin have matched their public defense of life with their own personal commitment to life
9025650 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9025651 in both cases we see true pro family leaders they stand up strong for life in the halls of power but also live the message of life in their families
9025652 the inspired choice of sarah palin highlights the radical views of obama biden on life and marriage catholic voters couldnt have a starker contrast this november
9025653 catholics like most americans are cautiously optimistic that the troop surge has calmed iraq catholics will naturally turn their attention to which candidate will stand strong on behalf of families
9025654 barack obama is not that candidate barack obama wants to repeal the defense of marriage act his first act as president has nothing to do with energy or iraq he wants to enshrine the right to abortion in federal law by signing the freedom of choice act
9025655 barack obama is so extreme on abortion that he thinks that babies who survive an abortion and are miraculously born alive should be refused food and water and be left to die
9025656 john mccain together with sarah palin is a natural choice for catholics mccain has a strong pro life record and he has made a commitment to selecting judges who will respect the constitution mccain has even bucked his own party on immigration and torture we think these positions align john mccain closer to catholic teaching and we are proud to stand with him as he prepares for a very difficult election ahead
9025657 the stakes of this election are too large to ignore abortion supporters
9025658 stater bros charities was pleased to sign on as the presenting sponsor of this years radiothon benefiting the loma linda university childrens hospital
9025659 with the economy struggling right now we were proud to be able to step in and fill the gap to help our community children achieve a brighter and healthier future
9025660 we believe the addition of fpr substantially strengthens our fluid power capability and makes us one of the largest distributors of fluid power products in north america
9025661 we expect the acquisition will be accretive this year and will generate approximately 230 million in sales on an annualized basis as a result we are increasing our sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2009 and now expect earnings of 2 22 to 2 44 per share on sales of 2 32 to 2 43 billion
9025662 i dont think it moves clinton women and this completely undermines mccains claims against obama of inexperience palin was mayor of a town of 6 715 people a city budget of 12 7 million and just 746 connections to the public water system thats a heartbeat away from a 72 year old president
9025663 sarah palin has competently governed alaska and has that to her credit she is a mother of 5 which credentials her with women mothers or not and she may very well try to win hillary clinton supporters over to the republican side her gender will surely be a benefit to mccain who has a poor legislative record on womens issues and has said some insensitive even sexist things about women over the years
9025664 americas future conversations about politics and policy during the 2008 republican national convention
9025665 i applaud john mccains selection of governor sarah palin whose commitment to reform and record of bipartisanship is exactly what our country needs i am confident that this team will continue to keep america safe and make our nation more prosperous
9025666 on the third anniversary of hurricane katrina we must renew our commitment to preparing for any disaster or emergency that puts americans at risk
9025667 while some progress has been made we have a long way to go with the current state of our preparedness lets hope the next storm does not test our nations defenses to the extent katrina did only three years ago

9025671 the u s army utility helicopters project office and sikorsky aircraft remain committed to the right technologies equipment and support infrastructure to empower our most important customer the soldier the uh 60m upgrade demonstrates the balance sikorsky and the u s army have applied to address both current and future needs todays achievement is the result of dedicated effort and hard work by the entire upgrade program team

9025673 the uneven and inequitable state of recovery of the gulf coast is a national embarrassment
9025674 the failure of our government to properly respond to the region is not only shameful it puts the lives of individuals in the path of the next hurricane at risk that is inexcusable
9025675 mirror on america how the state of gulf coast recovery reflects on us all
9025676 the third anniversary of hurricane katrina and the threat posed by gustav are far too sober reminders of how much more we need to do to fully restore the gulf coast
9025677 we must fulfill our promise to rebuild the gulf coast and renew our commitment to a region that is a vital part of america
9025678 mirror on america how the state of gulf coast recovery reflects on us all

9025684 building this clinic represents an important expansion in abbotts commitment to improving access to care for children in the developing world during the last decade
9025685 it fulfills a critical need in tanzania where we have been improving health systems not only for people with hiv but also for those with other chronic health issues as well
9025686 while we are making progress in enrolling adults into hiv care and treatment our services for children have severely lagged behind due to lack of trained physicians and other necessary resources
9025687 we expect the new center of excellence to accelerate our ability to make progress against our national treatment goals for children with hiv
9025688 the mbeya center of excellence will provide the foundation for pediatric hiv treatment for the foreseeable future helping not only to save childrens lives but increase health care worker capacity in the country
9025689 we are confident that we will see the profound improvements in childrens health in mbeya that we have seen across africa when integrating pediatric hiv clinics into national aids programs

9025705 due to system problems access to our flight booking system is currently slow
9025706 please note that it may take up to 30 60 seconds to move from page to page during the flight booking process although the booking process is slower than normal bookings can be completed but the delivery of the confirmation travel itinerary may be delayed
9025707 this problem has the potential to cost millions of pounds worth of bookings if customers go elsewhere
9025708 ryanair has a strong brand and this could help but people have a short attention span
9025709 at this time of year it can be a challenge for airlines because the systems need maintaining but staff are going on holiday
9025710 you might think the systems will stay up and running but they are major bits of software that rely on people to keep them working and its normal to experience some issues that need experts to solve
9025711 you have to be more patient and do load testing first
9025712 airlines estimate how many seats they will have sold and set price buckets for groups of seats but when they are not taking bookings as expected this can mean their assumptions were incorrect
9025713 well youve book with someone else now what do you expect me to do

9025726 the only way that john mccain is going to win is if we deliver georgia
9025727 we didnt want to use that much from the fund balance but we also didnt want a millage increase
9025728 taxes have gone up for five years in a row with the economy and the price of gas and other things making it tough for so many people we didnt want to have another increase this year
9025729 weve been coming in 500 000 or 600 000 under budget the last few years so if we can do that we wont need all of that from the fund balance
9025730 i can only hope the remaining members of the board parents and teachers will treat the loss of accreditation as a wake up call to pull together and make substantive changes in the way this system is operated
9025731 a greater injustice would be for sacs to turn and look the other way and grant accreditation to a school system that does not deserve it and in doing so validate that the current way of operating is best for students
9025732 it had to be done to send the right message but its unfortunate that kids will have to suffer
9025733 this is serious and i hope parents can do something to salvage at least the seniors for next year
9025734 we have this thing once a month where students catch a movie at midnight off campus
9025735 it only costs 1 the curfew would make it so we cant go out and thats just not fair
9025736 by the age of 18 we are recognized as adults by our nation and are able to experience all of the freedoms that are associated with this coming of age
9025737 i think that he has jumped the gun and is very misinformed about what is going on
9025738 yes crime is a problem but we have to look at solutions without coming up with things that are going to further violate peoples freedom and liberties
9025739 what are you going to say if you go to the game you gotta leave the game at 8 30 so you can get home its not a well thought out statement
9025740 whats the proposal to give them a citation or lock them up or what what are you going to do with them i think its a bit impractical even at this point i dont think you can declare martial law
9025741 that has to be looked at very methodically we need to work with what we have first
9025742 when you impose a curfew you are curtailing peoples rights so youve got to have a really good basis for it
9025743 its not just something you can go out and do
9025744 what we do agree on is that something has to be done
9025745 i went through the civil rights movement those days when you had to buy a sandwich and go eat it in some hole in the wall when you couldnt get a fair education for your children and i had to work all kinds of bad jobs to support my family
9025746 for me its just as historic having him be the one the democrats are really sending on
9025747 his speech culminates a very long primary season we know there are many people in this area who are supporters of his and the democrats
9025748 his appeal transcends racial lines age and economic lines his message is a message that is timely and will carry into the fall
9025749 theres so many people in macon that are not registered and dont know how to get registered
9025750 in order to make this historic we have to reach out to them
9025751 i enjoyed hearing michelle obama and im glad mrs hillary clinton is pledging her support
9025752 im really in the election spirit now i think obamas got a great chance
9025753 we have a duty to push back and push back now
9025754 push back what could they do to us they cant fire us its time for us to say no thank you we will not cut our budget
9025755 but were in this situation and weve asked agencies to identify areas of reduction
9025756 theres no question were going to work really hard to try to do the peoples business
9025757 but its definitely going to slow down the courts and cause a backlog in the county jails and a slowdown in civil litigation
9025758 all they hear is bad news they dont know if theyll have a job tomorrow
9025759 no matter what you and i ever do in our lives mr kelso neither of us will ever be as famous as uga
9025760 i really dont promote him i just try to keep him out of the way of people who might want to commercialize him
9025761 just a dog on a string what would we have nothing
9025762 america always has a favorite animal with the exception of secretariat and an animated mouse named mickey its usually a dog in years gone by rin tin tin was king of the canines then lassie but ever since sports illustrated put his churchillian physiognomy on the cover of the magazine in 1997 and proclaimed him the nations no 1 mascot the entire country and at times the entire planet has been ga ga over uga
9025763 there are probably some who think it odd to pay this much attention to an animal a puppy a dog i would suggest to you that uga is a very powerful symbol
9025764 hes always here hes a presence hes continuity you know youre going to see him every year and i think he just sort of has become a part of the culture of uga
9025765 uga had that sort of classic old school look that we kind of wanted
9025766 just showed up and theyd let them on the sidelines
9025767 sonny told me that his wife had a little baby english puppy whose grandfather was the georgia mascot at the rose bowl game on new years day of 43
9025768 lol theres to much sh t going on in your sig
9025769 style isnt something you can learn style is something you are born with
9025770 ook wij zijn verbijsterd we deden al jaren zaken met dat bureau maar ook wij krijgen geen contact meer we hebben aangifte gedaan omdat wij voor heel veel geld het schip in zijn gegaan
9025771 nee die mensen hebben zaken gedaan met le duc maar natuurlijk kijken we wel of we coulant kunnen zijn naar de gedupeerden
9025772 het bureau staat op naam van een stroman en meneer haluk zit naar verluidt in istanboel
9025773 no se pueden prometer t tulos uno siempre quiere ganarlos pero el sistema de torneos aqu en m xico es dif cil porque si fuese por puntos estar a m s complicado nos llevar an varios el primero san luis
9025774 es un cumplea os tenemos que festejar tampoco vamos a estar bajo la tierra sabemos que nosotros estamos en mal momento pero estamos trabajando bien
9025775 yo creo que no juega mal el equipo hemos tenido buenos partidos que se nos han escapado por x circunstancia y a eso es lo que queremos encontrar la explicaci n estamos trabajando bien estamos haciendo todo al cien por ciento no estamos en una crisis ni nada por el estilo el equipo est consciente de que necesitamos resultados
9025776 well have three vastly different plans each group has a different background and a different history
9025777 this is my hometown ive worked for the company for 30 years and im heartbroken at the opportunities that macon has missed without the right leadership youve got that in macon now you have a university that wants to get involved in the community to get involved and do something constructive in my hometown is exciting
9025778 we see good things happening here but also the potential that exists
9025779 what were trying to do is improve the corridor area for both residents and students
9025780 we want to guide people downtown were not trying to make the area into a new central business district
9025781 if the synergies are strong well keep skype in our portfolio if not well reassess it
9025782 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9025783 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9025784 yo estoy totalmente de acuerdo con ustedes que el equipo por ah no consigue los resultados todav a no consigue el funcionamiento que queremos estamos heridos pero no muertos eso es una cosa muy importante y una cosa que le aclar a los jugadores
9025785 coincido con todos ustedes las cr ticas pero este es un equipo grande tiene un entrenador con un curriculum de los mejores de centroam rica de sudam rica y no va a dejar de luchar en ning n momento
9025786 es algo nuevo para l que por ah no ha vivido este tipo de experiencia
9025787 yo tengo la mentalidad de no caer en la adversidad tambi n es un mensaje para el presidente porque en estos ltimos a os como entrenador he tenido cuatro presidentes y a los cuatro los he hecho ganar t tulos y sta no va a ser la excepci n
9025788 es la mejor defensa del campeonato y seguramente los jugadores van a ser todos los esfuerzos necesarios para revertir esto
9025789 a veces hemos tenido algunos inconvenientes te doy un ejemplo rojas no ha podido jugar durante todo el campeonato no son excusas tampoco porque me parece que el am rica tiene un plantel de buen nivel de buena categor a
9025790 esperamos que los rbitros tambi n sean un poco m s equitativos para ambas partes
9025791 nos estamos preparando bastante bien hemos realizado una gran semana de trabajo esperamos seguir por el buen camino esperamos que los rbitros tambi n sean un poco m s equitativos para ambas partes ya que no les estamos pidiendo que nos den pero tampoco que nos quiten de la forma que fue el d a viernes
9025792 la verdad que s m s que esto yo me refiero a que nunca he pedido que me regalen nada s lo que sean un poco m s ecu nimes a la hora de arbitrar s que son seres humanos y se van poder equivocar a favor y en contra pero deben tratar de estar m s cerca de la jugada para que haya menores errores posibles
9025793 estoy trabajando estoy luchando estoy metiendo y s que pronto va a llegar de nuevo vamos a tener la calma como lo hemos venido haciendo he venido trabajando para buscarlos los encontr y lastimosamente me los volvieron a quitar pero bueno hay que seguir trabajando luchar y mantener el ritmo que es lo nico que nos va a poder mantener para llegar al objetivo final
9025794 eso es lo importante no despegarse y tenemos la oportunidad en casa con nuestra afici n en nuestra cancha entonces como quien dice la casa tenemos que hacerla respetar y yo s que el d a s bado va a ser una gran virtud jugar en casa
9025795 no es bueno al empezar y acabar la fase de grupos fuera de el madrigal
9025796 el hecho de que sea bueno o malo el calendario para nosotros es algo muy relativo es verdad que empezar en manchester no es un debut f cil pero tambi n podemos ganar all y de hacerlo lo que parece complicado pasar a a ser buen simo
9025797 nunca se puede decir que un grupo es f cil pero sobre el papel tenemos muchas opciones
9025798 el trato entre nosotros es el mismo de siempre formamos un equipo y l forma parte del equipo por lo que el trato sigue igual lo que haga robinho es una cuesti n personal
9025799 no tiene porqu pedir perd n es una decisi n entre l y el club ning n jugador tiene por qu opinar
9025800 hay un cambio de temperatura de hora al que he tenido que adaptarme los fisioterapeutas me est n ayudando y me encuentro bastante bien
9025801 tenemos una incorporaci n nueva rafael van der vaart un jugador muy bueno que le va a venir muy bien al equipo no se si hace falta algo m s creo que formamos un buen equipo preparado para competir y sobre todo para ganar
9025802 rafa es un jugador muy bueno y lo mismo que sneijder hizo un a o buen simo en su primera temporada l puede conseguir que este sea un buen a o
9025803 todo el mundo dice que es un buen grupo dif cil pero hay que esperar un poco con equipos de ese estilo lo que es seguro es que habr un clima dif cil
9025804 no hay ninguna otra explicaci n que dar y es un asunto estrictamente deportivo llevamos a los mejores que est n de forma y no tenemos en cuenta otros factores que no sean los futbol sticos
9025805 la relacci n de cada partido es de 18 jugadores y con esta lista cumplimos con todas las incidencias adem s hay una competici n paralela que es la de la sub 21
9025806 adem s entre un partido y otro podemos hacer convocatorias y citar a alguno de los integrantes de la selecci n sub 21
9025807 mi obligaci n es estar al tanto de todos los jugadores espa oles y de la actualidad del futbol espa ol de la sub 21 y de todos aquellos que tengan el potencial de ayudarnos
9025808 ellos ya quedan en sus clubes e imagino que felices me preocupar a m s la inestabilidad que tendr an si no hubieran decidido su futuro
9025809 ayer no entren pero hoy lo hizo con toda normalidad y contamos con l como los 20 que hemos convocado
9025810 es muy bueno que espa a acuda a la champions con cuatro equipos nos gustar a que tengan m s jugadores espa oles pero es una realidad de los pa ses que nos rodea
9025811 los cuatro clubes representan al futbol espa ol que el grupo sea f cil o dif cil es una situaci n a priori
9025812 no viv ninguna situaci n comprometida en el calder n reclamaban la presencia de luis aragon s y no me parece extra o
9025813 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9025814 we do sacrifice a lot but you girls just dont notice because we never mentioned it or even thinking about it once its done
9025815 can help consumers resolve disputes with companies without the high costs and legal fees of a full blown lawsuit
9025816 most lawyers will tell you today that mediation is one of the most fantastic things to come along
9025817 for more than 80 years arbitration has helped americans settle disputes fairly quickly and inexpensively without having to file a lawsuit or navigate the court system
9025818 the sweeping legislation pending in congress would effectively eliminate arbitration leaving many employees and consumers with little recourse
9025819 voters were read a brief neutral description about arbitration provided some information about arbitration agreements and then told of the intention of some in congress to remove these agreements from consumer contracts with companies
9025820 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9025821 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9025822 mccain selects a woman who is two years out of wasilla serving as its mayor and who is younger than obama this suggests to me that he believes that he can forge a majority with bushs republican far right wing base and women who would have voted for hillary and just want a woman other than as first lady in the white house regardless of her policies
9025823 based on lessons learned from hurricane katrina businesses across the country are already mobilizing to help the gulf coast prepare for gustav

9025825 a young man from a small town with a very large imagination
9025826 eigentlich hatte dieser sommer im mittel ber ganz sterreich ein grad zu viel
9025827 ich war mit einer gr eren gruppe dort zum abendessen
9025828 meine handtasche hatte ich ber die rechte armlehne meines sessels geh ngt so zwischen viertel nach zehn und halb elf uhr abends war sie dann pl tzlich weg
9025829 da will die neue frau innenminister f r sicherheit sorgen und kann nicht einmal auf ihre handtasche aufpassen
9025830 vielleicht ein heilsamer schock fekter konnte damit am eigenen leib erleben was tausenden sterreichern t glich passiert
9025831 es ist etwas ernstes wir sind seit zehn tagen fix zusammen
9025832 anfangs hatte ich als mutter schon ein mulmiges gef hl als mich der bernie angerufen hat und meinte heute stelle ich dir meine freundin vor
9025833 aber tatjana war mir auf anhieb sympathisch wir wussten sofort was wir miteinander reden sollen
9025834 das stimmt es hat einige gegeben aber das ist ja mittlerweile hinf llig geworden
9025835 ich freue mich schon sehr darauf die mir noch unbekannte dame kennenzulernen bernie war richtig aufgeregt wie er mich dazu eingeladen hat
9025836 and starting monday all of my friends are going to appear on television
9025837 i dont like war i dont like greed i dont like meanness
9025838 has a moated market in turkey a country that is just starting to adopt cell phone technologies i believe this company has a lot of room to grow and few competitors
9025839 finally mccains choice of palin looks to be an especially shrewd decision because she will serve as his attack dog against obama and as obama showed repeatedly against clinton he is astonishingly thin skinned and ill natured in reacting to criticism especially when it comes from a lady expect palin to focus her fire on obama and watch closely how he will react to it
9025840 es ist nicht eine entscheidung von wenigen metern sondern es geht um kilometer
9025841 ich w nsche ihr alles gute und viel kraft mit uns gemeinsam das land zu regieren
9025842 wenn ich mit den menschen in hessen rede auch in meiner eigenen partei dann wollen die immer noch den politikwechsel

9025845 a young man from a small town with a very large imagination
9025846 to think that something that i worked on played such an important role in someones life and helped them understand something important to them it makes me really happy
9025847 as i was getting ready to graduate i was looking at companies to join and i wasnt sure what to do
9025848 one of my friends knew i loved to play videogames and said to me what about nintendo
9025849 i played videogames since i was a kid i really liked games a lot
9025850 but i never had a home console and always just went to the arcade to play as a result id never heard of the famicom or nes though as soon as i knew that was what nintendo did i thought hey i like games and games are related to computer graphics so lets give it a shot and see what i can do
9025851 a formula one racing game but i dont think that ever got released overseas so lets just drop that one
9025852 but the reason i wanted to investigate them was a result of being so lonely when i arrived in kyoto chiba is east of tokyo and quite a distance from kyoto and when i moved there i left my family and friends behind in doing so i realised that being close to them being able to spend time with them talk to them play with them was such a great important thing i wondered for a long time if there would be a way to recreate that feeling and that was the impetus behind the original animal crossing
9025853 what did barak obama become then on that sunday morning in 1985 he became he says a christian
9025854 only a cynical heart would refuse the possibility of a lonely black man in his twenties finding faith through the preaching of gods word
9025855 i was kinda amazed that this many people stayed for the question and answer session
9025856 usually on a night like this a big television night people leave as the credits roll
9025857 think about the fact that the states stood more for racial subordination and bigotry from the civil war through at least the civil rights movement
9025858 although we do not condone the actions antonio participated in for a time as a competitive athlete he is remorseful and is now in a position to speak out against the dangers and consequences of using illegal substances
9025859 i deeply appreciate the second chance the university of north carolina is giving me
9025860 i promise to work hard not only as track coach but as a person who will dedicate myself to teaching young men and women to make the right decisions and to know that there are no shortcuts when it comes to competition training and integrity
9025861 east asia pollution aerosols could impose far reaching environmental impacts at continental hemispheric and global scales because of long range transport
9025862 this is very challenging science with lots of complexities and a lot of uncertainties
9025863 this pollution is distributed on average equally from northern california to british columbia
9025864 anyone who has gone out to measure it has found something
9025865 people assumed the atmosphere scrubbed itself and didnt believe these pollutants could travel thousands of miles
9025866 air pollution is not a local or regional problem it is a global problem

9025871 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9025872 people see some of the things i do and they say why dont you show this to the world people dont know you do these things and maybe i will
9025873 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
9025874 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9025875 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
9025876 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
9025877 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
9025878 the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation
9025879 the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9025880 if you remember how television changed politics with the first televised presidential debate not necessarily for the better with our grizzly groundswell strategy we have the potential to change politics in a good way a main street media way
9025881 we are unleashing conservative thought voice and image with this online media empire
9025882 alguien pregunt ayer a mccain dijo obama que cu ntas casas ten a y l contest que no se acordaba que ten a que consultar con sus asesores despu s los asesores le dijeron al periodista que ten a al menos cuatro ese es john mccain qu puede saber l sobre la crisis hipotecaria

9025890 so it was game on today ive shot pep once and we killed it whats nice about working with pep is that
9025891 my focus isnt on working still shots because i focus on filming

9025914 has been flying dawn bout from baltimore to him for private meetings and these meeting are preparing her to be the breakout star in a solo career apparently diddy believes shes the most talented of the group and the girls are pissy because they disagree
9025915 at no point was dawn flown anywhere to record solo or meet alone with diddy the girls are still very much together theyre going out to the video music awards together and theyre promoting their album welcome to the dollhouse and working on their third
9025916 the real reason the studio cut curtis out of the campaign is because their research and exit poll information showed that 50 actually was not the urban or young demographic box office draw they were hoping for
9025917 50 basically cant draw in the core demographic that used to buy his albums by the millions the box office let down of get rich or die trying should have been a hint of things to come
9025918 its no secret in the music world that 50 cent has lost some mainstream appeal but in the film world you dont necessarily need multi platinum albums to have a successful film career common mos def etc you just need to appeal to the urban demo 50 clearly is losing that appeal

9025924 i think that the vice presidential choice that john mccain makes is probably the most important choice hes going to make in this entire campaign
9025925 because he has no room for error no margin for doubt if he picks a pro choice running mate it will confirm the unease and the mistrust that some evangelicals and dont forget this social conservative catholics feel about mccain
9025926 probably governor sarah palin of alaska because shes a person of strong faith
9025927 she just had her fifth child a downs syndrome child and theres a wonderful quote that she gave about her baby and the fact that she would never ever consider having an abortion just because her child had downs syndrome shes strongly pro life
9025928 shes a virtual lifetime member of the national rifle association she would ring so many bells and i just think it would help with independents because shes a woman shes a reform governor i think that from what i hear that would be the choice that would probably ring the most bells along with mike huckabee of course whos a southern baptist
9025929 a lot of people hear about a broader evangelicla agenda and they think oh evangelicals are giving up on believing that life begins at conception theyre not giving up on that at all not at all
9025930 sarah palin clearly addresses the issues so many conservatives are concerned about it balances out the ticket
9025931 shes also really a checkmate for the democratic party because folks who were looking to make history for barack obama can make history by voting for john mccain in seeing the first woman elected to the vice presidency it was a very strategic move by john mccain
9025932 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick
9025933 by choosing the boldly pro life sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has taken his stand as the one true authentic pro life ticket

9025973 the rate of throat cancer or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus has risen steadily among white americans over the past 3 decades according to a new report
9025974 we pay attention to the schedule and certainly we dont want to give up anything on the nationwide series because were still fighting for a top five in points and trying to get some wins
9025975 but if something were to happen a rain situation with a race sunday or the schedule gets conflicted in a way we dont want to lose any focus on our cup program
9025976 we just have auggie standing here he has done an excellent job in the races that he has subbed in for me through the middle part of the summer having him here is a good plan b if something were to happen and obviously it doesnt look like its going to rain but if one car is really struggling or if i have to focus on one car he is here to help us out
9025977 after we leave here and if were in 12th or 13th or whatever the case may be well know what kind of spots we have to be ahead of a certain guy and maybe talk to some of the guys who have been in this situation before
9025978 i know my teammate jamie mcmurray a few years ago was kind of in this situation
9025979 the bottom line is everybodys going to be driving as hard as they can to try to win the race to try to get a good finish
9025980 you just have to race and everything is going to happen for a reason
9025981 if we dont make the chase its not going to be because of these last two races
9025982 so you just have to go and do what youve been doing if you drive yourself crazy trying not to make that mistake youre probably going to slip up and make that mistake
9025983 in an environment where energy is probably the number two after the economy and housing issue in this election she is really a terrific choice for mccain here shes also obviously a terrific choice because shes a woman trying to attract those hillary voters now and those supporters
9025984 we talked about energy as the key issue and i asked her directly did john mccain approach you to be his running mate
9025985 you know she answered me really very sheepishly saying well weve spoken many times about a number of issues and weve spoken recently obviously about energy

9025999 i feel very wise and sage but at the same time very young
9026000 just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9026001 i am writing all the time i love composing and the whole thing but i am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them to ride bicycles and how to read i love it
9026002 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time when they are on a ride and they are screaming and they are happy it makes me emotional cause i see they are having a real good time
9026003 hey lets drink this whole bottle of jagermeister and then take these 7 or 12 different colored pills
9026004 i think our guys are ready and i think we have a slew of receivers who can play so whoever they have in the game and whatever we do we have a lot of weapons i think that is a great situation to have if we can have three wides or four wides there is not one guy you have to target on and say hey we have to prevent this guy from getting catches we can work to a number of receivers and guys do a good job of getting open our running attack is looking good with some healthy running backs our line is looking good so i feel positive about where our offense stands where our team stands and i am looking forward to the start of the season
9026005 coach coughlin talked to me and said i wasnt going to play in the game
9026006 i still wanted to go through warm ups and just get some throwing in i didnt throw any on wednesday and i knew we were going to be off on friday and saturday so i didnt want to take four days off of completely throwing i just wanted to go through warm ups and keep my arm loose i just wanted to still be out there as part of the team and even though i wasnt going to play just go through my normal routine
9026007 we have a good group of players there is good focus and you look at the strength of our team having had the experience of playing down through the playoffs and so you are optimistic about that and i think that the evaluation process where the young guys fit in how they can help you all of those things are critical in seeing where you are at now that having been said it is a one game at a time proposition the answer to the question is not down the road it is now it is right now and so you are back into the concept of one game at a time and trying to do the best thing you can with your team in terms of how you match up against the next guy and that is what the nfl is all about
9026008 just the focus of our team the mentality of our team
9026009 everybody came day one in training camp ready to go physically mentally and emotionally guys are ready to get that 2007 season behind them and move forward i think we had a good training camp we had just really one major casualty as far as injuries and missing a guy for the season with osi umenyiora but for the most part everybody physically came out safe everybody has been attentive we kind of left off with what we did on defense as far as running the schemes understanding the schemes and even being able to add a little bit more to our packages i think from a mental standpoint guys are even more focused than they were last year and ready to get off to a fast start
9026010 i think we have a team that still feels we have something to prove
9026011 we are just not satisfied with where we are as a team it is a matter of knowing that we have to become a better team and i think that has been our focus when you look at the whole last season the regular season especially you just see so many areas that we can improve on and we were playing football that wasnt our best and we knew we were capable of playing better we just have to work hard on that and just be consistent week in and week out i think that has been our motivation and we know we have to do that
9026012 in other spots i believe that it is a process it isnt something that you wait until the final hour it is ongoing it is the establishment of opinions it is the ranks that occur after every game it is how it all fits together in terms of special teams so it is always a time of a certain amount of anxiety no matter what because you cant get away from the fact that the mixture is really critical and also you have to be aware of how these people are going to fit together and play roles on special teams
9026013 we have to make decisions on first of all what is the status of lawrence tynes and i think that is ongoing and fortunately we do have a day here when we can continue that progress and from that decision the decision from our medical people then we have to make the right decision for our team so we will see how that goes we were never interested in status quo and we are not in this situation either with the information that we have we have to make those decisions
9026014 i just didnt feel like it was fair to the other guys to put ourselves in position where having played well with the group that was on the field extensively into the fourth quarter that because of some coverage errors and because we couldnt handle the exchange that we would jeopardize the opportunity for these guys to come away with the feeling of reinforcement for having played well and won
9026015 he really has played the best of any of the second group
9026016 we had always thought of him as the guy that would be the first in if we did have something that we had to contend with so when this came about we just thought about playing him and stuck him in there at the tackle position where he has practiced a little bit but not a lot just to make sure that he understood that he has to know guard and tackle
9026017 hopefully we can quiet that down so that he can be in position to work on sunday when the giants begin practicing for the redskins

9026019 we looked at everything the police brought to us and looked at the elements of the offense
9026020 and we just didnt feel it reached that level so we choose not to file charges
9026021 were freaks about it says childs chief chocolate officer his official title of tcho
9026022 we havent even seen how great chocolate can be yet says colin gasko owner of rogue chocolatier a chocolate maker despite the word
9026023 i dont think that anybody in the world making chocolate right now is making the best chocolate that can be theres such tremendous potential
9026024 in beta and is set to open in the first quarter of next year is among the biggest of the new wave of chocolate makers with 18 employees and with the capacity to make 3 tons at a time
9026025 thats still less than what the big guys spill during a shift change childs says
9026026 micro batch producers are coming out with 50 to 1 000 pounds at a time with just one or two people making the chocolate such as art pollard of amano artisan chocolate in orem utah steve devries of devries chocolate in denver alan mcclure of columbia mo
9026027 its a very courageous choice to make chocolate especially for the small processors says international chocolate consultant chloe doutre roussel who wrote the chocolate connoisseur and recently has been helping a cacao cooperative in bolivia launch a chocolate bar for the export market
9026028 it takes quite a lot of investment in machinery even those with small machines end up buying bigger ones plus you need to pay for trips to buy the beans and to ship them
9026029 three years from now well probably see double the number of chocolate makers in the u
9026030 it sounds banal but it reflects back to the internet and technology
9026031 let people make it on their own and find people who can help them we couldnt do this 10 years ago we couldnt do this five years ago
9026032 how could it be that i could grind this stuff in my kitchen and have more complex chocolate than any id ever had before
9026033 we have so much upside now if the french bought all their grapes in ship loads from africa how good would the wine be thats about where we are with chocolate
9026034 infield improvements and models for fermentation and drying childs says
9026035 thats the first order to improving quality and flavor im looking at this not just from bean to bar but from pod to palate pod to bean is the most crucial step in the process
9026036 for me to make chocolate i need to go there be involved in the harvest and be involved in the drying he says
9026037 id heard about the drying of beans in chuao venezuela where prized beans are from went down and learned how they made the stuff
9026038 i decided to design and build my own refiner and conch from scratch i think one of the great things about doing it the hard way instead of buying machinery is that you really learn why things are the way they are
9026039 im still trying to figure out whats going on with the cocoa bean

9026044 the teachers version of the story was that the children were the ones who introduced the fighting into the classroom as a game

9026163 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease
9026164 i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
9026165 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9026166 the flame will symbolize over the next 10 days the unique sporting spirit displayed by paralympic athletes
9026167 if i were being ye i wouldnt attack me a very large snake might get a little angry at ye
9026168 so ye be sayin but i aint gonna allow ye to stay
9026169 for me to be sending ye back to hell i need to destroy yer body in a fair fight yed best me me i dont believe in fighting fair i believe in fighting smart
9026170 were spirit linked now dwarf i live you live i die and you have three days before your soul flees your body to be with me you kill me and you burn in hell
9026171 damn snake has a death wish what kind of pet owner teaches his pet to throw lightning
9026172 i need ye to hold these the red one brings ye the snake the white be for horse
9026173 i be spirit linked to a demon im going to find a way out of this if i be too late jaffa likes ye and horse needs a home
9026174 find me a warlock find me an elf healer talk them darn dragons in the caverns of time into rewinding time a wee bit go to hell each of them in that order with any luck i wont make it to the last
9026175 what do you say to a guy about to go to hell
9026176 good luck i dunno i be heading to everlook ye wanna come
9026177 not in that teleporter of yours forget that dwarf i think ill start asking the high council for suggestions obviously you cant stick around and wait for their answer
9026178 ha hes alright folks no worries youre the fifth to come out of the teleporter on fire were pretty sure that the problem is on our end
9026179 aye just little ole me no worries though ye always said i was headed straight fer hell
9026180 i said me some fancy words when i did it too well what can ye do doc
9026181 darn you dwarf if youd have let it live youd be able to live the immortal life of a demon until someone else sent it to hell i cant save you from this
9026182 how bout ye educate me instead so maybe i can break this curse
9026183 aye thats why i like you ty you always carry me ale
9026184 the spirit link is usually forced upon demons because it works both ways as long as the demon lives youre immortal warlocks would force this to ensure their immortality well the crazier warlocks it also made the warlock slightly more vulnerable to agitation and over time theyd be able to summon powers that their demons could normally access after decades the remnants of the warlocks soul are no longer discernable from that of the demon its all corrupting over time lucky for you though you killed it meaning youll be 100 you when the link drags you into hell
9026185 thatll be quite the surprise on hell then no prison down there can hold me i promise ye that
9026186 if the link is visible both you and the demon in one place then a warlock can sever it
9026187 i knew it ye cant keep a good dwarf down i just need me a warlock to summon this demon
9026188 i failed to exchange pleasantries with the beast before i blasted it back to hell
9026189 dont be sorry ye helped me plenty i now have a chance my plan had been to storm into hell make them wish theyd never pulled me under i be crazy like that now ive got a new plan
9026190 we met an ancestor of yours a guy named davnid he was responsible for helping to set up the great forge
9026191 i can get me another one though i just need to find me the assassin
9026192 cant you just build one why do we need him
9026193 it be that gnome engineering i cant build one he can hes on a mission to kill some tauren i might be able to find him never done this before
9026194 the high council had no ideas so i hearthed here as soon as i could i figured you might need some help
9026195 i always wanted to know what went on in that helmet
9026196 as much as id like ye by my side fighting the hordes of hell this is my fight mustafah i made my bed ill lie in it
9026197 and with that the flames disappeared and davlin lost all life from his eyes
9026198 i couldnt summon the demon here because we didnt know his name with davlin with him theyre connected spiritually one and both stuck in hell for all intents and purposes davlins a demon and i know his name
9026199 if hes physical i can see the spirit link between them and break it then of course youll have to kill the demon
9026200 their both in there fighting for control weve gotta get them separated
9026201 he launched forward with an amazing speed and backhanded each of them with a demons strength
9026202 hey dwarf this fighting smart doesnt seem to be working
9026203 for the last time ye blasted idiot i be telling ye the truth
9026204 so youre telling me that you were possessed lit on fire twice even shot stabbed and blasted by multiple lightning bolts
9026205 aye thats what i be tellin ye dammit why does that seem so hard to believe
9026206 it was good but my start was not too good
9026207 i concentrated on winning and as im starting to get a cold i was not able to think about any faster time
9026208 it could be that we complete something in the next few days before the end of the transfer period
9026209 the transfer pot we have available has also changed and well use it
9026210 the star of this movie jimmy tsai has invented a truly hysterical character in c dub wang a chinese ranconteur whos equal parts spike lee quentin tarantino charles barkley and larry the cucumber and director jessica yu knows how to milk every setup for maximum laughs
9026211 the dirty little secret everyone in washington knows a set of financial truths so inconvenient that most elected officials dont even want to talk about them
9026212 and if the production team could have brought it home with a fitting final act i think this would have been halfway decent film but instead of a powerful message about belief and sacrifice we get a climactic moment that left the audience i watched with literally laughing out loud
9026213 the coaches have said it but they didnt even need to say it thats the first thing we thought about as soon as we knew who we were playing and knew about how drastic if we lost how that could affect our season
9026214 its a game youve got to be pumped up for every game or just like last year itll be one of the biggest upsets like in the michigan appalachian state game you cant overlook anybody
9026215 its a game its the first game the first home game its the season opener no matter who it is what more can you say youve got to be hyped up that were playing ball again
9026216 you never know it might be that one time out of 50 or whatever the odds are that you beat a team like that
9026217 we understand the caliber of team were obviously playing too and we just want to go out and play as well as we can and stay injury free for the most part and get ready for the next week
9026218 its all about us if we do what we need to do against anybody then well play good
9026219 and if we dont do what we need to do then no matter who it is we can be beat
9026220 theyre going to be very confident as they should be
9026221 they have like 16 guys that transferred from football bowl subdivision teams
9026222 its not the kind of team you think ok this is i aa its a team we should beat this is a team that has the potential to beat a lot of people
9026223 they can look at the tape and see that theyre a good football team
9026224 their quarterback was a no 1 pick last year and obviously there are people around him that helped him do that
9026225 theres a lot of guys on their team id like to have on my team
9026226 va a ser bueno que cambie la cosa porque esta gente ya no da para mas

9026229 you look at this and say boy i hope this thing doesnt really explode but it probably will
9026230 gustav is expected to be a large powerful hurricane as it approaches the northern gulf coast
9026231 in the premiership who do you think is the best partner ship up front
9026232 for us africa still has a huge amount of promise
9026233 there are still things we want to do with the african setting and i think its safe to say well continue to explore it
9026234 that said we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting that wants us to make the next game there but honestly were still at the preliminary stages
9026235 if we wanted to make the next game set in the forest of south america we could do it
9026236 but i think to save time for us one of the reasons we chose to use the african setting is because we felt that in order to retain the far cry brand value of an exotic dangerous environment a place that maybe people havent had a chance to see themselves or have seen extensively in film television and other games we wanted to choose africa

9026238 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players
9026239 player choice lies at the heart of fuels action packed races and with a huge range of vehicles packs of up to 16 vehicles speeding across diverse terrain and a no boundaries no limits approach to racing means players have never had so much freedom to conquer the wilderness and take the chequered flag
9026240 the technology asobo studios has developed to build fuel is ground breaking to create a game on this unprecedented scale to this level of graphical quality complete with all the dynamic weather effects is a great achievement
9026241 fuel had to be a special title for codemasters to include in our racing portfolio and we believe that from both a gameplay and a technical perspective fuel compliments our long standing tradition of driving excellence
9026242 greater reductions in childrens consumption of soft drinks will require policy changes that go beyond food availability at school such polices may include zoning regulations on food outlet types in residential or school areas and promotion of more healthful substitutes such as milk and fruit juice
9026243 we figured out how to get the mother of all blood stem cells with the right culture conditions
9026244 there is real hope that in the future we can grow billions of blood cells at will to treat blood related disorders and just as critically if not more so weve got ace as a new old marker to guide our work
9026245 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow
9026246 we can make lots and lots of blood cells from human stem cells for transfusions regenerate new vascular trees for heart diseases as well as create test tube factories for making transplantable blood cells that treat diseases we are very far from treatment
9026247 now that we have an accurate way to count these cells we are able to confirm what we long suspected that blacks might have a bigger army of hla specific b cells
9026248 if the recipient is not sensitized b cells represent only a patients potential for making antibodies
9026249 however about a third of patients in need of a kidney are sensitized since theyre often on their second or third transplantation and may have undergone transfusions
9026250 knowing that blacks have an increased number of hla specific b cells which increases their opportunity for antibody mediated rejection we may be able to customize treatments for black recipients to account for these differences and lessen the likelihood that the organ will be rejected
9026251 a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9026252 the mccain palin ticket will appeal to voters across party lines
9026253 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9026254 puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team
9026255 gov palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government gov palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9026256 gov palin is an independent leader who has fought the special interests on behalf of the people of alaska the mccain palin ticket will appeal to voters across party lines
9026257 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9026258 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9026259 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9026260 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9026261 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9026262 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9026263 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9026264 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9026265 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9026266 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9026267 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9026268 she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief
9026269 john mccain bio s running mate is for big oil and against the environment
9026270 if you are not for opening anwr in the state of alaska you couldnt get elected dogcatcher
9026271 i am pleased to see sen obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs

9026278 people become hyper vigilant everything makes them nervous and any unresolved feelings about past trauma get stirred up
9026279 what theyre going through right now is a reawakening of all of those feelings some of those who went through the storm and lost their homes are afraid of losing it again particularly those who lost everything are still displaced and still not able to return home
9026280 they were all in this together and it is a tragic situation
9026281 its inaccurate to say we were all in this together

9026290 we ran into such a problem last year where we didnt have enough quality guys in the system to fill in for injuries
9026291 we had 17 guys hurt at one time in springfield and we had guys playing that were banged up and hurt when you lose a first or second liner out of springfield even though you call up a first liner out of echl stockton its still a big drop from there
9026292 if theyre not playing well itll be a bloody merry go round between springfield and stockton
9026293 if jerry comes to me trying to make a deal ill tell him to go f himself
9026294 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one

9026314 its hard to see how well ever get out of this deficit hole at this rate
9026315 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
9026316 but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy

9026320 its started but it has not overtaken 23 yet laughs weve seen new spots from cycle 24 with new magnetic activity that is definitely cycle 24 it has started but it has not produced enough sunspots to take off and take us out of minimum yet so were still in minimum by almost any count

9026335 i dont think it moves clinton women and this completely undermines mccains claims against obama of inexperience palin was mayor of a town of 6 715 people a city budget of 12 7 million and just 746 connections to the public water system thats a heartbeat away from a 72 year old president
9026336 sarah palin has competently governed alaska and has that to her credit she is a mother of 5 which credentials her with women mothers or not and she may very well try to win hillary clinton supporters over to the republican side her gender will surely be a benefit to mccain who has a poor legislative record on womens issues and has said some insensitive even sexist things about women over the years

9026344 its just a great little gig if you like to ride your bike
9026345 definitely for this convention its the green convention the city has been pushing the pedi cabs
9026346 the selection of a vice presidential candidate is one of the most significant and telling decisions a presidential candidate can make john mccains selection of sarah palin raises serious questions about his judgment why when the country is fighting two wars facing an uncertain economy and an energy crisis did senator mccain make the choice that he did why with so many other qualified women and men in his party did john mccain choose sarah palin sarah palin is not the right choice she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade and continuing george bushs failed economic policies john mccain and sarah palin will not bring the american people the new direction they need

9026361 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government

9026452 she has more executive experience than your boy obama and biden combined and she has 5 kids im pretty sure she knows if its ok to go back to work if it was hillary with that story youd be raving about what a strong woman she is
9026453 but mccain is so old if he dies shell have to be president
9026454 whatever you think of barry o hes got intelligence to spare to handle the job a voter worried that obama doesnt know what hes in for can console himself with the fact that hell be a quick study
9026455 give me a copy of the budget a yellow hi liter a pot of black coffee put sportscenter on that flat screen i need hockey scores

9026469 south ossetia and abkhazia are a part of georgia under un recognized laws in fact laws and that russia itself has supported
9026470 and before august 6th you did not have russian bases on that territory

9026472 georgia is going to need the support of the world

9026482 cyric will be mostly pleased seeing his followers working out to restore his friends fallen name

9026488 texas is gonna have a lot of great athletes on the field
9026489 they have the luxury of being the biggest school in the state of texas so whenever they recruit they get to choose whoever they want to play for texas
9026490 everybodys always going to bring up appalachian state against michigan

9026574 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question
9026575 some of the attacks are just out and out false for example suggesting that the bush administration hasnt invested in alternative or renewable energies
9026576 this president has been unfairly attacked across the board by many democrats for quite a while
9026577 best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief
9026578 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy
9026579 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9026580 he knows what its like in high political season and hes not going to respond to every attack
9026581 thecheappop com is a terrific site for pop culture news with lots of original material all written with wit and good nature its been running strong since october 2005 in web terms a near miracle of staying power
9026582 she has an extraordinary talent when it comes to communicating personally with people its as simple as that
9026583 that obviously propelled her into the governors mansion in alaska
9026584 we see a person with an incredible amount of integrity that happens to like to hunt and fish and subscribe to all the things that make alaskans tick
9026585 the governor took a pretty strong position that the industry didnt like
9026586 but at that point in time the majority of alaskans thought it was the right thing to do
9026587 the only tax cuts ive heard the tories talk about is inheritence tax and corporation tax during the economic downturn its the poorest that suffer the most not the richest so why not focus on cutting tax on the poorest people

9026590 once the domino effect happened however creditors became more aggressive you literally had a situation where suppliers were saying that they would not fill up the aircraft unless they got money up front and of course that money could not materialise in time so we were left with no alternative but to suspend
9026591 we are going to need some big performances from them its up to the youngsters in the next two games to put their hands up and stake a claim for places
9026592 our bowling has been below par too but in all three discplines we have been poor
9026593 this one has been hugely disappointing but the fact is its time for us to move out of an era of one day cricket that we had and move forward for the world cup in 2011 our attack is very inexperienced and in some key batting areas we have a lot of younger players the guys now need to refocus and grab their chances
9026594 its two different formats it was a very special test victory for us we ended one part and started another
9026595 we had different guys coming in after the tests with new energy so i cant use that as any excuse
9026596 ive been disappointed about how weve been outplayed in all three areas we have fallen down on the basics and thats an area we hammer away on we havent managed to do them properly and thats my major worry i see it as a major challenge for my management team we havent been in this position for a long while now
9026597 in gutem glauben erst einige minuten sp ter stellte sie fest dass die mitarbeiterin zehn euro monatlich also 120 euro hingeschrieben hatte

9026613 the pilgrims are arriving with their packs full of insects and the ones walking with dogs sneak them in at night and then everyone is angry when we have insects in the albergue
9026614 then just before we left bless those pilgrim g tes d tape david was besieged by bed bugs and by the time we arrived in london he needed antibiotics antihistamine and cortisone in multiple doses to offset his allergic reactions so now it was davids morale that wavered and for a while he questioned whether to carry on

9026619 our mission is search and rescue and we are still hoping that we will find caylee alive
9026620 if he takes care of those by this afternoon or by tomorrow we wont revoke the bond

9026623 its about the 16 guys in the team and the bench strength captain is only as good as his team
9026624 crickets not a game in which you can rely on form in the sense that you can get a good start but the bowler running in is in better touch
9026625 if you get a start and the rest bat around you you get a chance to put up a big score if we win series like this we can afford to carry the players who arent in form you know what theyre capable of and theyve paid dividends in the past but you cannot rely on one individual
9026626 you cant sit back and say you won the world twenty20 or the cb series or this series sachin tendulkar and virender sehwag help achieve consistently but there were injuries we didnt have ishant sharma and sehwag was in prime form but the others contributed and im glad with the contributions of the new players
9026627 these were slow tracks and it was important to rotate strike
9026628 and we were able to do that and played the spinners well we negotiated murali well which has been tough over the years in sri lanka and we tackled mendis well i was impressed by the way we handed these two in the middle overs it wasnt just about playing mendis it was about scoring off him whoever got set in made it big a 70 on such tracks was immense
9026629 if this was the last game of the series tied 2 2 and we lost people would start saying that in the last 23 finals india have lost 18 but neither this team nor i have played 23 finals it was crucial we finish the series before reaching this game
9026630 its about the 16 guys in the team and the bench strength a captain is only as good as his team
9026631 a captain shares responsibilities finds problem areas and sends the best guy to rectify that problem a good team makes a good captain not the other way around you have to let players go in the right direction after that it is up to the individual
9026632 you want to have batsmen who run quickly who can convert ones into twos and put pressure on the fielders
9026633 it is good to have a side like that if youre scored a par score and have a fielding side which is safe then you add 15 20 more runs
9026634 the players who have done well domestically and on a tours have been rewarded in the selection process you come across equally consistent players and it gets tough thats when you have to make the choice to take you forward you have to give everyone enough chances not just a few games if he cant prove he knows what his mistakes are and can go back and correct those
9026635 i enjoyed my break but i enjoyed my training more
9026636 what you do in practice reflects in the game im glad to have contributed

9026651 the security guy we had had to go cover mrs obama
9026652 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father president john kennedy inspired them but i do now barack obama
9026653 he didnt say it would be too far and today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon we can do it again
9026654 she always talked about the kids that were getting picked on in school or the people having trouble in the family i didnt realize it then but i do now those were the guys she was going to dedicate her life to
9026655 you do what you say youre gonna do you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like

9026659 one day they obamas daughters and your sons and daughters will tell their own children how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears
9026660 let us stand together to elect barack obama president of the united states of america

9026680 im no threat to no child because i like women
9026681 i think everyone is under serious threat at the moment were going to need some big performances from them
9026682 i thought we bowled very very poorly i certainly dont think it was a 300 wicket not by a long way your first few overs set the momentum we gave them a lot of runs early on
9026683 were not playing good cricket at the moment but i think england are playing unbelievable cricket and are outplaying us in every department
9026684 weve lost a few key players but we probably lost the game in the first 10 to 15 overs today as chasing 300 was always going to be an uphill battle
9026685 we arent firing on all cylinders we came here to win the test cricket but we pride ourselves on our performances and we dont want people to forget what weve achieved here
9026686 the citizen tips have continued to come in throughout the last 24 hours and law enforcement are taking those tips very seriously and continue to follow up on them

9026698 i got up to have a look but the moment i got to the door i was attacked suddenly immediately i was struck on the head with a blow which made me totter
9026699 he put himself in front of me to try and defend me but he too was knocked down without mercy they hit him until he stopped crying out then they beat father salvatore and father martin as well it was terrible
9026700 presumably the attackers thought they would find riches at the monastery
9026701 a poor man who does not know how to measure his words
9026702 has no power to send anyone to heaven or to hell
9026703 is not a place it is a state in which a person can be a nation can be in hell
9026704 and i think that there is no need to give credit to the words because of where they are coming from or to the mouth they have come out of where do they come from from a poor man who does not know how to measure his words and we dont need to pay attention to the words he says
9026705 hell protect a womans freedom of choice because government should have no say in whether or when a woman embraces the sacred responsibility of parenthood
9026706 they can choose what they want to choose and we can choose what we want to choose thats america thats what democracy means thats what freedom means thats what individual rights mean
9026707 we believe in the right to choose for our personal health and we know the right choice to protect that right to choose it is president barack obama and vice president joe biden
9026708 now you have to be pretty radical to have a zero rating
9026709 they want to essentially make it illegal for us to have a right to choose and to make us criminals and to make doctors criminals
9026710 we are in as much danger today as we were almost when we first started here there is so much at stake for women on this one issue and its critical that we elect barack obama
9026711 we probably cant stop it but we can change it next year
9026712 it was the right to control our reproductive systems that made it possible for almost all of us to achieve our own dreams which our parents had paid for
9026713 we do what we have to do for the survival of our children
9026714 we in the united states of america have to do this be politically engaged for the survival of our children and of children all over the world
9026715 what they are trying to do is turn into individual rights that which attacks fundamental human rights of the person
9026716 are we not the witnesses of opinion campaigns and pressure from international powers to foster national legislation to introduce forms of liberalizing abortion and unrestricted bioethical manipulations of making same sex unions the equivalent of marriage of promoting eugenic and euthanasia practices
9026717 human rights cannot be arbitrary they must be universally applied and be well founded upon reason
9026718 if human rights are not established they are left baseless
9026719 they remain at the mercy of whoever is in power
9026720 who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people who are counting on us
9026721 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick

9026723 the contrast between those two facts about the candidates is going to come out were going to make sure that it comes out its a very striking contrast
9026724 we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift
9026725 contrast that with sen obamas approach to leaving born alive babies left sitting there for dead and also making the comment if his daughter got pregnant he would not punish her with a baby
9026726 i think this will help us know he really does embrace this issue in political practice as well as in his voting record
9026727 most significant pro life platform in the republican partys history
9026728 this team does not reflect one iota of weakness it is the strongest pro life team with a pro life platform in the history of the republican party
9026729 how can you go wrong with a moose burger eating fishing governor
9026730 when you compare her experience to barack obamas experience her executive experience her experience as mayor her experience as assistant governor her experience as a reformer her experience as an environmental activist
9026731 she is more prepared more experienced to be president than the top of their ticket
9026732 social conservatives are dancing in the streets this is smart and dare i say sexy pick my wife cathy and i are gushing
9026733 member states will need at least five or six days to study the draft
9026734 may not need very much time to get high level political decisions as we have smaller bureaucracies than others
9026735 will power can propel the state to new heights we can show others how jharkhand is put on the fast track of development

9026742 if pana christians are demanding st status simply because they speak the local kui language then there are people from general castes in the same areas who speak it too if speaking kui is the yardstick for according st status then it should be uniformly applied to all
9026743 the authorities were aware that there would be trouble after swami saraswatis killing yet they allowed the body to be brought in a procession from tumudibandha to chakapada a distance of over 200 km the sight of the body incited passions and led to attacks on churches and christian homes
9026744 since habitations are scattered and most roads run through jungles they can be blocked by cutting just one tree the attacks both in 2007 and now were possible only because the roads were blocked with felled trees
9026745 even though forces were mobilised in time they could not get to the riot spots in time

9026756 that to me is ridiculous i dont understand how that can happen
9026757 hes going to have to bang a little bit to get in at me and hopefully ill be able to wake up by then
9026758 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
9026759 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
9026760 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
9026761 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
9026762 the evidence i received he busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
9026763 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
9026764 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
9026765 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
9026766 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
9026767 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
9026768 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about
9026769 if it wasnt for his friend and the grace of god thatd be it

9026932 the agency didnt hesitate to use its new authority in this case and it will not be shy about using this new tool to warn the public in the future when the health and safety of the public require this kind of immediate notice
9026933 i liked it everything about it i just liked my work
9026934 this really has been their coming out to the modern world
9026935 i turned on the tv and i saw all the western channels that were criticizing china and i thought this doesnt really square with the feeling that people in the west have about whats going on in china there is a lot of openness
9026936 a lot of the team is really production focused now and were generating content for the most part a lot of the tech and underlying engine is really solid
9026937 most of the design team is still on act 1 because were refining and improving the quests and flow and some of the big game systems that we havent really announced yet
9026938 but you want your best work which you tend to do latest in the project to be at the beginning of the game
9026939 its pretty much how blizzard works we have a tendency to iterate over and over again on everything we do so we build something and then we rebuild it
9026940 if we havent rebuilt something five times it really doesnt deserve to be shipped thats pretty much our policy
9026941 a bartering system is actually a very exclusionary trading system
9026942 a currency really provides a common language thats the point of a currency we dont want to do some of the stuff that diablo ii did where they kind of actively devalued gold
9026943 really were trying to allow more people to get into the trading game because the more people that are in it the more fun it will be
9026944 were going to give people lots of ways to expand and deal with your inventory and more info on that coming in the future
9026945 the necromancer is an awesome class actually my favourite class from diablo ii and the class im currently playing the most of
9026946 its not that we just dislike him we love the necromancer but the issue we have is he was so well designed theres certainly some things we could do a little differently but do we feel like we can make him so much better and change his core gameplay experience if anything wed say we really dont want to
9026947 after we felt like weve kind of established the core diablo iii game
9026948 we really want to make sure that the tone of the game is right that its dark that its foreboding
9026949 what we showed at wwi really is a very early game content you know its first act dungeon first act environments you
9026950 believe me im all for the environment but i think human life has to come first i dont want to give up my husband for a tree

9026952 i cant re imagine it currently its just not something that ive thought about to be quite honest i dont see it happening
9026953 meanwhile many workers feel they have little choice but to pay for organized labors billion dollar 2008 election campaign and many workers are unaware of their right to object
9026954 this labor day we commend those courageous american workers who are standing up to union intimidation harassment and even violence as they defend their cherished freedoms of conscience speech and association and we work toward the day when no american is forced to pay tribute to an unwanted union
9026955 the world is a dangerous place to live not because of the people who are evil but because of the people who dont do anything about it
9026956 im so thankful that my midwife and doctor paid such wonderful attention to me and the little ladies and im really glad that i got to 36 weeks with multiples

9026962 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9026963 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling

9026980 i looked back to the right and saw something fall by the officers door
9026981 i saw him standing over the officers body with a gun in his hand waving it over him
9026982 he fired one last shot and the body stopped moving
9026983 the individual was already walking out when the deputy got out of his car and made a sign to come toward him
9026984 then the officer leaned into the car and the individual made a right turn and then we heard shots

9026994 bounce in the gallup daily track which will take another measure today as mccain touts his running mate
9026995 convention bounce has put him eight percentage points ahead of republican rival john mccain in the latest daily tracking poll with mccain hoping that his naming of a running mate today will start reining in his opponents advantage heading into next weeks republican national convention
9026996 obamas significant lead over mccain almost certainly reflects the effects of the democratic national convention gallups jeff jones reports today
9026997 the two presidential candidates were tied at 45 percent in the last gallup poll daily tracking results conducted entirely before the convention began jones notes
9026998 obama has clearly seen a rise in the polls since the convention began with a four point increase in his support from 45 to 49 percent with the margin moving eight points in his favor jones notes
9026999 obamas largest advantage at any point in the campaign was a nine point lead recorded july 24 26 so as his partys convention concludes he is about as strongly positioned as he has been at any point this year
9027000 we agree and are discussing it with att steve sent from my iphone
9027001 will be a coming out party not just for slow food usa but for the whole food movement in this country
9027002 it will be a somewhat more choate movement and something that politicians will recognize as something to take note of
9027003 for many people this will introduce slow food to america
9027004 voting with your fork is one of the most important votes we have
9027005 were trying to bring food back into the area of nature and culture
9027006 wholesome affordable food grown by people who care about what we eat
9027007 use public schools as an engine for wholesome food so all our children are fed and educated from kindergarten wholesome delicious food should be a right not a privilege
9027008 a handful of corporations have taken over our food supply
9027009 for the last 8 years weve had a government thats taken everything in totally the wrong direction the government has done very little to improve our food safety systems i encourage everyone to take a look at those recent salmonella outbreaks
9027010 probably 20 000 to 30 000 people were sickened and for months the fda couldnt find the source or misidentified the source
9027011 the most profound thing ive learned is that we can never take our food systems for granted
9027012 we have to pay attention and we have to take care of our producers
9027013 we value greatly this leadership position and believe that we have the opportunity to further strengthen the m i brand in central ohio

9027018 its a great honor to speak at any convention under any circumstances espcially in light of 1992 i think no matter what the circumstance or the history he would be proud
9027019 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now but do we truly know the man behind the science

9027041 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
9027042 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
9027043 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
9027044 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
9027045 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
9027046 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
9027047 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
9027048 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
9027049 it is not the network that is fault but the interaction of the bad power control algorithm in 2 0 and 2 0 1 software and the network that is at fault the sooner everybody is running 2 0 2 software the better things will be having seen the graphs the 2 0 2 software has already started to make difference

9027055 the best upscaling technology in the world cant make average quality standard definition content look like high quality hd content because the content just isnt there
9027056 we have too many high sounding words and too few actions that correspond with them

9027061 fragrance chemical allergy a major environmental and consumer health problem in europe
9027062 oakmoss treemoss extracts present in cosmetic products have a well recognised potential to cause allergic reactions in the consumer as fragrance ingredients
9027063 chloroatranol was shown to cause elicitation of reactions by repeated open exposure at the ppm level 0 0005 and at the ppb level on patch testing 50 elicit at 0 000015 as chloroatranol and atranol are such potent allergens and chloroatranol particularly so they should not be present in cosmetic products

9027083 a hail mary pass or hail mary play in american football is a forward pass made in desperation with only a small chance of success the typical hail mary is a very long forward pass thrown near the end of a half or end of a game where there is no possibility for any other play to score points this play is unlikely to be successful because of the general inaccuracy of the pass and the defensive teams preparedness for the play makes it likely that it can intercept or knock down the ball

9027119 ive made this prediction that the geographic north pole may be ice free for the first time in instrumental record
9027120 but when you get in a kayak and you go north from svalbard youre actually going into the trans polar drift so the flow of the ice and water is south and youre heading north

9027156 i think it will excite the base shes an accomplished woman and i think she has heart i think the fact shes on the ticket gives women a feeling that they are more empowered i think women figure women always listen better than men to womens issues so i think it could be a real benefit
9027157 were offering a western ticket to the people of the country this year plus sarah palin has the ability to appeal to a lot of those who supported hilary clintons historic candidacy she has a tradition of shaking up the status quo shes another maverick that goes along well with sen mccain
9027158 i couldnt be more pleased he made a good choice picking someone who is an up and comer in the party she has fought for ethics reform and fought against some of the corrupt machine in alaska ive followed her career since she became governor in alaska she was my dark horse i was really hoping that shed be the one
9027159 i think its a perfect fit for john mccain i flew up and did a fundraiser for her in 2006 i was very impressed with her the conservatives will be happy shes bright and articulate america is just going to have to get to know her

9027172 these are your nuts it should only take 15 minutes
9027173 so that added to the weird mood at the convention with some democrats nitpicking obamas appearance after michelles knock out speech and the fabulously cute girls
9027174 in case of war redzikowo and slupsk will be more secure than other places and not less secure
9027175 you condemned redzikowo and slupsk to annihilation like hiroshima and nagasaki
9027176 from the point of view of polands interests we will be strategically more secure
9027177 i am the last person to seek conflict with our neighbours but as prime minister i must not leave poland defenceless
9027178 can you deny that having the shield base redzikowo will be target no 1 for countries that dont agree with it
9027179 i prefer to have here american troops rather than soviet troops
9027180 depends on you how well you are able to seize that opportunity
9027181 i am pro life and i believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman
9027182 i support flexibility in government regulations that allow competition in health care that is needed
9027183 children with down syndrome require an awful lot of attention and the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
9027184 if it were a man being picked who also had a baby with down syndrome would you also ask the same question
9027185 can be tough against a woman doesnt it give her a gender advantage
9027186 you cant be too tough on a woman in a debate or can you

9027189 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9027190 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9027191 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
9027192 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
9027193 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
9027194 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck
9027195 there is today more u s refining capacity offline for economic reasons than can be destroyed by gustav
9027196 similar to last years ncaa championships having two teams represented in the doubles main draw shows the type of outstanding performers we have

9027205 we took the model that google used farms of commodity servers and we offer a database that can be deployed on massive farms of clusters and can transform hundreds of individual servers into a single database where people can store data and do complex analytics on it
9027206 before this the idea of analyzing that much data at that much scale was just too expensive and too hard
9027207 a giant step backward in the programming paradigm for large scale data intensive applications
9027208 temos um projeto de ascens o divis o principal do campeonato nacional e o m rcio careca parte essencial neste projeto
9027209 teremos de analisar em detalhes qual foi o problema at o acidente o teste ia bem mas tivemos alguns problemas por volta de meio dia tarde acho que a pista estava um pouco mais lenta e n o pudemos realmente progredir a batida n o foi legal e n o estou certo do que aconteceu
9027210 tivenos um pouco de sa da de frente e a passagem pelas zebras n o estava t o confort vel mas n o estava ciente de ter cometido um erro
9027211 esses tr s dias de testes produziram resultados positivos para n s podemos estar particularmente satisfeitos pelo fato de que o carro teve 100 de confiabilidade na pista completamos 1 800 km mais que qualquer equipe aqui
9027212 pudemos obter um bom equil brio embora haja mais a progredir quanto ao desempenho tamb m provamos os pneus da bridgestone que ser o usados e desenvolvimentos para nosso sistema de frenagem que provaram ser positivos
9027213 acho que o dia foi muito bom vai ser dif cil ter um dia assim no ano amanha acertar a volta e largar na primeira fila mantendo esse ritmo vou conseguir um bom resultado
9027214 o fato curioso que n o houve qualquer tipo de impacto sobre a m o eu apenas estava arrumando o protetor e senti uma dor que piorou com o passar dos treinos

9027218 prezydent i premier estonii prezydent otwy oraz doradca prezydenta adamkusa zaprezentowali bardzo ostre stanowisko proponowali sankcje wobec rosji czyli zawieszenie wsp pracy unii z rosj oraz zaostrzenia wizowe a ponadto sankcje natury gospodarczej

9027223 this is a bridge loan that will allow the structuring of a longer term project finance demand for cement outstrips supply in syria and lafarge has competent local partners
9027224 my home shakes i can smell it i can feel it and im sick of it
9027225 most of its going to be on those big dump trucks coming out of route 24 and their not going to spend their money there theyre just going to tear up the roads
9027226 i think its because thats where i grew up at its a beautiful part of the country beautiful part of the county and i just think itll destroy it
9027227 the vibrations levels from our blasts are 70 to 80 percent below state allowable levels
9027228 well if the ground water table were to recede low enough to where it affected the neighbors well the neighbor would know it
9027229 for a long time we thought it was our own private business how we feed ourselves but now we understand there are consequences
9027230 a lot of people dont like to cook they like to nuke
9027231 we do live in a society where our time is so valuable that we dont sit and enjoy meals like our forefathers did
9027232 the farm bill is making very very few people successful the vast majority are hurting
9027233 the big commodity regions of the country are becoming poorer and poorer we have to reverse that
9027234 energy health care climate change you cannot make progress on those three issues without addressing food
9027235 you sliced up some tomatoes with some of their olive oil cheese and prosciutto and you just put this dinner together and it was beautiful
9027236 thats the one thing i dont want slow food to go to is that elitism cooking where it gets so complicated and its almost like wine snobbery
9027237 an exemplary life up until the time of the offenses and even after
9027238 judges dont like to be accused of making a mistake
9027239 even though the number of travelers on the road is expected to be slightly lower than last year we want to ensure that road construction delays do not get in the way of an enjoyable holiday period
9027240 ich kann euch nicht h ren macht etwas l rm
9027241 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
9027242 help defray some of the cost increases that the industry has been absorbing since 1995
9027243 the higher electricity tariff has an immediate impact on lafarges cost of producing cement and the increase in diesel price directly impacted our inbound and outbound transportation costs
9027244 this also indirectly affects our other costs including overheads contract works and capital expenditure
9027245 this is an average of about 2 6 per annum which is much lower than the annual inflation rate while other costs have risen much higher in recent years
9027246 we will absorb additional costs but there are limits to how much we can absorb the rest we need to pass on to consumers
9027247 in theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is
9027248 this helped us to not only improve our current year prices but to also negotiate a multiyear deal whereby our prices are not locked for the next 24 months
9027249 they try and wear you down and wont come to a final price quickly they try to make you give up
9027250 if you want to know who i am look at the books i published
9027251 fizemos um esfor o enorme para tentar segur lo inclusive cobrindo a proposta salarial do clube alem o mas infelizmente ele mudou de id ia e disse que esta transfer ncia faz parte do seu projeto de vida
9027252 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9027253 people see some of the things i do and they say why dont you show this to the world people dont know you do these things and maybe i will
9027254 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
9027255 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9027256 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
9027257 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
9027258 fizemos um esfor o enorme para tentar segur lo inclusive cobrindo a proposta salarial do clube alem o mas infelizmente ele mudou de id ia e disse que esta transfer ncia faz parte do seu projeto de vida
9027259 this represents the first major shift in 100 years in the way concrete is prepared and the icrete system is available worldwide the rising costs of materials labor and concrete itself have no geographic borders
9027260 we also saw in europe some project delays particularly in the consumer industries
9027261 the whole theme of globalization is that economies affect each other
9027262 the u s economy is going to be flat at best for the second half of this year what does that say to me europe is increasingly going to be affected as well as is japan and other places around the world
9027263 the jury is still out on whether decoupling is a myth
9027264 so far caterpillars results are telling us its for real at least in the short term eventually you obviously get to a point where a u s slowdown a western european slowdown could start to negatively impact whats going on in asia and the middle east
9027265 i just think the environment is getting more negative and its going to get more difficult for them
9027266 as it is contractors are facing difficulty in controlling cost of projects and commiting to timely delivery of projects and the cement price increase will add more pressure to cash flow problems faced by contractors
9027267 the same thing happening to steel bars prices have gone up to an all time high of rm4 100 per tonne in the case of steel bars although it was liberalised on may 12 the liberalisation process was not well implemented
9027268 the association is also pleading that the liberalisation should be complete by allowing all items under hs code 7214 and all steel bars for construction use under code ms 146 and bs 4449 to be fully liberalised
9027269 in other words the government should liberalise all steel bars and wire rods used in the construction industry wire rods come under hs codes 7213 7215 7217 and 7314 which are widely used in low cost construction and ibs industrialised building system component construction

9027273 global policymakers will likely find strong debate around the balance between maintaining a safe and secure internet and protecting users civil liberties
9027274 these tensions might be eased by adopting a global internet bill of rights a concept that has strong support among stakeholders
9027275 above all political speech on the internet should be protected globally
9027276 the internet has no center of gravity no one concentrated location of central control
9027277 the u s letter also strongly confirms our perception that the us wants governments to be in charge of icann policies rather than business and civil society stakeholders
9027278 without a doubt our federal approach to transportation is broken and no amount of tweaking adjusting or adding new layers on top will make things better
9027279 it is time for a new a different and a better approach
9027280 the idea is simple use federal funds to encourage new sources of investments for transportation instead of replacing them
9027281 our plan will make it easier to pay for and build roads and transit systems it will deliver fewer traffic tie ups better transit services and a stronger economy it will make our roads safer and give americans new confidence that the money they invest in transportation will actually deliver results
9027282 medvedev might have had some chance to win support from some individual central asian states after bilateral talks but never in the format of the whole alliance which acts by consensus and where most members view china as the major partner
9027283 i realized by using the high notes of the chords as a melodic line and by the right harmonic progression i could play what i heard inside me thats when i was born
9027284 we wrote a generic exemption that would authorize the use of shingles and asphalt if the place wishing to do it provided us a management plan that we approved
9027285 its because it may be a different shingle or a different type of product on the roof
9027286 i think going green is what started it when all the homeowners and builders started calling asking where they could recycle their stuff
9027287 but i think in the last year the high price of oil is whats driven it
9027288 some states have been doing it a lot longer than michigan
9027289 we have seen an upswing by the private sector because of the upswing in the price of oil
9027290 no ones worried about saving the environment as they are that it makes great economic sense
9027291 theyve got all the beautiful people out there nobodys watching the game the white sox now thats baseball
9027292 can the republicans make the case that palin is ready to lead this country should the need arise
9027293 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9027294 yes i would like to see alaskas infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9027295 ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport but the 398 million bridge is not the answer
9027296 despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project and its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9027297 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened

9027303 so what has probably happened here toyota had to create this one product that integrates the gps cd changer the blue tooth telephone the trip information and the other 15 things i have not discovered yet it probably started as one component which then had to be reworked to integrate the second component and so on when everything was said and done we have what i get to use now it sure does meet all product functionality requirements that it was set to achieve but it falls well short of usability requriements thanks to product integrations do your products suffer from this same problem
9027304 i was drawn to people who go out on a limb and are ridiculous
9027305 you may go home to your shitty little apartment at five in the morning but until then you are outside yourself something more
9027306 i dont have any interest in being mean i remember the first time we were shooting the meatpacking district and clearly we have an agenda shooting the meatpacking district we had just got there it was maybe 10pm and there was a girl already passed out on the street vomiting my first reflex was to take the photo my second reflex was to walk around her and take a photo with her face not visible i gain nothing out of being an asshole
9027307 you find out what makes the person tick what makes them afraid then you try to amplify it to a point in which you see the actual person
9027308 i asked her a very compassionate question would you be interested in taking a photo the way you really look it was coming from the right place so she did and she revealed and this girl who struggled to take one decent photo not good but decent nailed every shot
9027309 this is where your eye is drawn it winds up at her face
9027310 specialty healthcare has changed considerably in the last few years and as a result it has become more important than ever for community based clinics to maximize their inventory management and charge capture
9027311 we worked closely with a network of physicians and administrators to build a user friendly system designed to meet the unique business needs of community practices lynx mobile helps physicians maximize practice management efficiencies and spend more time providing the best patient care
9027312 our practice continues to be impressed with the versatility of the lynx mobile application and responsiveness of the lynx mobile team the ability to track everything we need to including lab fees office visits and supplies has resulted in the virtual elimination of lost charges within our practice
9027313 as the first lynx mobile customer we are pleased to see the growth and acceptance of lynx mobile and excited to continue to leverage lynx mobile in improving our practice efficiency and financial health

9027326 after reviewing the decisions that were made by the solicitor and clemsons administration reading statements by witnesses including a female witness and taking into account the fact that deandre had no previous disciplinary problems i decided to make this recommendation to athletic director terry don phillips
9027327 coach bowden and i reviewed all the facts we have available from the organizations investigating the case
9027328 coach bowden has done an outstanding job when it comes to discipline of his student athletes we have had hiccups like all programs but by and large he has an outstanding track record in this area accordingly i support coach bowdens recommendation

9027336 ellos tienen la necesidad de sacar un buen resultado creo que van a arriesgar un poco m s y hay que tratar de aprovechar es un equipo muy compacto que si se llega a desesperar puede dejar espacios atr s que pueden aprovechar los jugadores r pidos que tenemos

9027356 our not for profit theaters tend to do between four and six plays a year
9027357 thats already limiting compared to the u k and we dont have a tradition of producing writers in their 20s
9027358 you can be in your 30s by the time you reach production in the u s
9027359 and in your mid 40s and still be referred to as a young playwright
9027360 our not for profit theaters are anxious to produce work that wont alienate their supporters
9027361 the reliance on subscription individual donation and corporate donation conspires to support more established playwrights that makes it really hard for someone young to break in
9027362 i shudder to think what i would have been writing if id had to come up solely through the american system
9027363 i either would have stopped because the plays were being rejected or i would have started writing a different kind of play
9027364 i dont think im the most formally inventive playwright ever to come along but i always try to do something that to me at least is formally challenging
9027365 and i think about psychological content in relation to the political

9027429 the findings of several studies on the practice of religion show further that islam exhibits an effectiveness in manifold forms that penetrates deeply into the daily life of muslims and presents a powerful force for the shaping of daily life as well as for the structuring of social relationships
9027430 a successful integration put into practice in everyday life can be identified only in somewhat more than 10
9027431 encourages young muslims to commit suicide attacks or instructs them in doing so
9027432 the use of physical violence as a reaction to the threat presented to islam by the west as legitimate
9027433 only islam is able to solve the problems of out time
9027434 affirm the statement that democracy in germany is one of the reasons for the high rate of crime
9027435 the observance of the commandments of my religion is more important for me than democracy
9027436 absolutely substantial minority with a problematic attitude toward violence and or democracy and the rule of law
9027437 only a small minority of 6 displays a high acceptance of politically and religiously motivated violence
9027438 on the whole the results of this survey lead to the conclusion that in the muslim resident population a relevant potential on the level of personal attitudes exists that can be suitable as a ground of resonance and a field of recruitment for radicalisms and extremisms
9027439 in sum it therefore can be established that a significantly heightened acceptance of violence is connected with the affiliation with the islamic religion
9027440 if strong anti semitic or antichristian prejudices and or great distance from democracy are taken together as characteristics that define a group at risk then on the basis of the data in hand one can discern such problems for almost a quarter of young muslims 23 8 it is a matter here of a minority that is not to be underestimated and that shows clear indications of intolerance distance to democracy or authoritarian features
9027441 among the young people the potential of young muslims responsive to political radicalization up to the extent of excessive violence is noticeably higher than in the general population
9027442 thus also among the highly educated muslims as which students here must be regarded a high risk group quite definitely can be more exactly located significant here along with a religious alignment in a form that bears in itself a strong devaluation of the west and a wholesale upgrading of the value of islam is the intensive confrontation with the position of muslims in the world and the subjective perception of their discrimination and oppression
9027443 the descriptions are to a great extent interspersed with the locution of muslims as victims expressed with the most varied nuances to be sure this is substantiated to a certain extent with references to details which however in very few cases are attributed to direct personal experience dominant is the description of the situation of others who one personally knows and about which one knows
9027444 i am treated here and looked upon as though i am a terrorist as though one is a constant threat only because i come to prayer
9027445 there is such an effort to discriminate against muslim women that almost nothing any more can be done with a headscarf thus one becomes aggressive
9027446 developed a distinct feeling of being increasingly in the focus of observation and always being exposed to the danger of being placed under the suspicion of islamism and of struggling against democratic structures
9027447 an accommodation of his conduct or the conduct of other muslims to the rules of the receiving german society is in his eyes an unacceptable imposition
9027448 exclusion deprecation and oppression of muslims on a national as well as international level
9027449 in sum a quite considerable portion of the muslims living in germany students as well as the general muslim population is convinced that the community of muslims in the global sense is discriminated against and treated poorly
9027450 fundamentalist orientations that combine a close religious attachment a high relevance of religion in daily life and a strong orientation on religious rules and rituals with a tendency to exclude muslims who do not observe these as well as with the tendency generally to heighten the value of islam and to derogate western christian influenced cultures show an enormous dissemination in the general population about 40 are to be assigned to such a pattern of orientation
9027451 it seems to be the case that this search for meaning and the struggle for values requires a dialogue and credible dialogue partners who on the one hand do not dismiss islam and also do not encounter it with an arbitrary attitude but rather themselves are strong dialogue partners standing upon a solid foundation

9027598 what we really need is some kind of stability for oil prices for four to six months even at high prices just so people know how to plan
9027599 airlines have no choice they have to replace their fleet if they want to stay in business theyll find ways to do it
9027600 when you look at the details of whats going on it looks like a reasonably rosy outlook for bombardier

9027608 ha habido una oferta del real madrid por el jugador de m s de 40 millones de euros
9027609 la verdad es que durante el ltimo mes y medio han sucedido muchas cosas en mi cabeza y en mi entorno cosas que no hab a vivido antes y para las que no s si estaba preparado
9027610 he de agradecer al valencia el gesto que ha hecho por m y al club todo lo que me ha dado desde que llegu hace tres a os el presidente se ha esforzado por darme cari o en los momentos que m s lo necesitaba y yo espero seguir dando el m ximo rendimiento e incluso mejorarlo
9027611 la cl usula era de 150 millones de euros y nunca iba a mover un dedo para salir del valencia
9027612 si me quieren fichar deben negociar con el valencia porque yo estoy a gusto aqu mi actual club no ha aceptado una oferta de mucho dinero y eso para mi es un orgullo en definitiva no he visto posibilidad alguna de salir de mestalla
9027613 mi evoluci n como jugador puede ser igual aqu que en el real madrid de lo contrario nunca hubiese firmado mi renovaci n espero devolver el cari o que esta afici n me da en cada entrenamiento y en cada partido
9027614 conozco a cazorla y a iker bromas de esas solemos gastar a diario
9027615 estic molt content de estar a i hui amunt valencia
9027616 el valencia y david villa van a seguir juntos muchos a os para m es un honor anunciar que el mejor delantero de europa va a seguir en nuestro equipo
9027617 por encima de las palabras aqu est n los hechos estamos elaborando un proyecto deportivo con paso firme con rigor y fe y con los pilares de la credibilidad y la ambici n ni siquiera hoy quiero acordarme de los que vaticinaron lo que hoy descartamos en el valencia hacen falta hombres con valor en el campo y respeto por la afici n como es david
9027618 es un mensaje claro y rotundo para el resto del mundo del f tbol y algunos de sus dirigentes el valencia no se va a dejar intimidar por nadie con el valencia se va de frente y con las cartas encima de la mesa no aceptamos otra forma de actuar
9027619 a la afici n hemos de decirle que tenga tranquilidad y fe que no nos den las gracias porque hacer grande al equipo es una exigencia que parte de nosotros mismos

9027630 it is unprecedented to see the platforms of both major u s political parties incorporate key pieces of ffls unique message
9027631 of course there is a certain excitement about the recent movement toward ffls woman centered solutions and message by the parties and now the selection of a pro life feminist as the vice presidential nominee but as a nonpartisan organization we cannot endorse any candidates
9027632 ffl members represent a broad political as well as religious spectrum and we remain both nonpartisan and nonsectarian there are many issues outside feminists for lifes mission feminists for life is dedicated to systematically eliminating the root causes that drive women to abortion primarily lack of practical resources and support through holistic woman centered solutions we recognize that abortion is a reflection that our society has failed to meet the needs of women and that too often women have settled for less women deserve better than abortion
9027633 we invite all parties all public servants and all people to join us on the bridge of woman centered solutions
9027634 abortion is a reflection that we have not met the needs of women women deserve better than abortion

9027686 ive enjoyed a wonderful and incredible 18 months right from the very opening of this restaurant
9027687 tao is an extraordinary restaurant and richard and his partners had a fantastic concept and a brilliant creation it was fantastic to be an integral part of a very winning team but now ive got a lot of other opportunities to explore first though i need a vacation in cabo go see mum and dad and enjoy my first love first hand the superbowl before i select something else new and challenging in vegas im definitely staying here in the most exciting dining destination in the world though
9027688 we are very pleased to have mark on board at tao asian bistro we look forward to the new additions that mark will bring based on his previous experiences in some of the countrys best restaurants current chef de cuisine josh thomsen has moved on to pursue other professional opportunities and we wish him the best in those future endeavors
9027689 josh played a very important part in the successful launching of tao and he was loved by everybody here for his skills professionalism and his dedication we know he will go onto bigger successes and we hold him in high regard and wish him the very best he was a valued and trusted employee and will be missed
9027690 its a sad thing in this business that diligent dedicated disciplined journeyman chefs can work away really hard putting in incredible hours to build a business and then when its at the top the owners bring in a star name to give it an extra boost when they cant take it any further its a classic situation in the restaurant business and thats probably exactly what happened here josh was great and did a fantastic job but now they wanted some extra glitz and glamor with a tv name attached to it
9027691 i have the pleasure and satisfaction of knowing our incredible kitchen staff was the best in the business and some nights turned out an amazing 1 200 top notch gourmet dinners at the same time as hosting another 1 000 simultaneously for cocktails there arent many restaurants that could claim that anywhere in the world so i depart on the best of terms knowing we achieved everything and more that we set out to do
9027692 ive been using every one of the items for sale in my vegas kitchen viewers will get to buy the same cook wear i use when everybody from vince neil to alice cooper come into the restaurant for dinner we had two of the knives specially crafted in japan with very unique slicing serrated blades the saucepans are top of the line and my name is embossed on the bottom of each one ill showcase some of our exclusive vegas restaurant menu specialties in the cooking demos to go along with the sales blitz
9027693 the best restaurant in las vegas and one of the finest anywhere in the world
9027694 the mentoring process is a very important part of any chefs development and im pleased to support the next generation of culinary talent in las vegas

9027700 the main idea behind nobhill was to create a restaurant that would reflect the type of dining opportunities found throughout san francisco in one comfortable neighborhood style location
9027701 the menu features a diverse selection of the type of food and fresh products most closely associated with dining in san francisco at least 80 percent of the product comes from growers and producers located in the bay area it is the first time some of the items have been available outside of northern california
9027702 it is to be a humble space this isnt a fusion of anything there is no show there is no las vegas in the room nothing shouting design
9027703 and the food reminds us all why san francisco is such a great food town
9027704 if it catches fire it will melt but the great thing is you can just throw it in the sink to put out the flames

9027717 two of us had never met each other in person and we thought if we shared our ideas and encouragement remotely motivating and learning from each other then why cant other military spouses do exactly the same thing
9027718 it also occurred to us that if we wanted to find other military spouses to buy from hire make a friend find a colleague or mentor in the same profession we didnt have a way to do that
9027719 the directory is also available to members of the general public who would like to support these military spouse owned businesses

9027721 john mccain s risky choice of gov sarah palin gives him a running mate who doubles down on his maverick image may appeal to hockey moms and other women and counters barack obama s aura of new generation change but he may have undercut his best attack on the democrat if obama is an empty suit as mccain has suggested is palin suited for the oval office herself she is younger and less experienced than the first term illinois senator and brings an ethical shadow to the ticket
9027722 she palin has an ethical issue as well alaska lawmakers are investigating whether palin abused her power in firing a public safety commissioner lawmakers say they want to know whether palin was mad at the commissioner for not firing an alaska state trooper who went through a messy divorce and ongoing child custody battles with palin s sister

9027726 we are grateful for these employees who are essential in helping oshkosh succeed while also serving the country in a separate capacity and to support them is the right thing to do
9027727 in the military the best leaders are those who always take care of their people and it is no different in the civilian workplace
9027728 oshkosh corp has shown that it takes care of its people its employees who are also reserve and guard members know the company is helping take care of their family while they are away serving this country
9027729 our approach was not to think that we were selling pastries

9027744 i dont consider myself a democrat at all im an independent
9027745 mccain over the last four to six years has proven that hell do whatever the republican party wants him to do obama on the other hand has a good message of change
9027746 the conservatives compare obama to a rock star because rock stars come out of nowhere
9027747 people like him dont come around too often tonight is the night its about tonight
9027748 tell a story be specific take your belief out of the ether and ground it in the events of your life consider moments when belief was formed or tested or changed think of your own experience work and family and tell of the things you know that no one else does your story need not be heart warming or gut wrenching it can even be funny but it should be real make sure your story ties to the essence of your daily life philosophy and the shaping of your beliefs

9027752 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9027753 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9027754 there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain
9027755 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9027756 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9027757 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9027758 to climb his way out of the real problem he has with women
9027759 the battle in this election will be very much among independent swing voters
9027760 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9027761 people see some of the things i do and they say why dont you show this to the world people dont know you do these things and maybe i will
9027762 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
9027763 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9027764 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
9027765 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
9027766 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero a heartbeat away from the presidency
9027767 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9027768 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about
9027769 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest class ceiling in america
9027770 but it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that once and for all

9027823 for muslims it is not how long one can fast it is how well he or she can follow the guidance of allah

9027825 ramadan serves as a periodic adjustment for proper human balance
9027826 this state ultimately allows individuals to gain self mastery and total control over their heated desires selfish appetites and other urges that dominate the life of every woman and man in this society muslims deny the body those things which are normally lawful in order to strengthen the total self against all that is unlawful

9027838 whatever your view on caesareans for some women its always going to be the safest choice
9027839 and while couples having normal deliveries have been given more and more opportunities to be fully involved in childbirth very little has been done to see how we could make the experience more meaningful for those having caesareans what i realised was that caesareans were done a certain way because theyve always been done a certain way but in fact they can be done differently and in a way that parents love
9027840 they say but surely you have to get the baby out fast so she can get oxygen straight away and i say when the baby is being born shes still attached to the umbilical cord and is still getting oxygen from the placenta caesarean birth can be gentle just as vaginal birth can be gentle obstetricians are too hung up on getting from the point of incision to the birth of the baby as quickly as possible thats been the benchmark of a skilled surgeon but im challenging that because from the babys and from the parents point of view its not very helpful

9027991 as an industry we need to begin setting some basic common sense standards that reward pc gamers for purchasing our games
9027992 the console market effectively already has something like this in that its games have to go through the platform maker such as nintendo microsoft or sony but on the pc publishers can release games that are scarcely completed poorly supported and full of intrusive copy protection and then be stuck on it
9027993 this is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years and really deserve
9027994 the pc market loses out on a lot of sales because a significant percentage of our market has pcs that may or may not be adequate to run our games without the ability to return games to the publisher for a refund many potential buyers simply pass on games they might otherwise have bought due to the risk of not being certain a game will work on their pc the average consumer doesnt know what pixel shader 2 0 support means for instance

9028000 i am going to make an offer to the government and the united nations to participate in a joint investigation with the coalition to continue to look at the facts surrounding these allegations and to make sure that we have come as close as we can to everybody knowing the truth of what happened in azizabad
9028001 the distinctions between different parts of the coalition are perhaps understood by the coalition
9028002 but they are not understood necessarily by the media and by the afghan population
9028003 we regret the loss of civilian life but the numbers that we find on this target area are nowhere near the number reported in the media and we believe there was a very deliberate information operation orchestrated by the insurgency by the taliban

9028103 the first thing i noticed pulling up here was the gas was higher here in kentucky than it was in tennessee
9028104 gas prices are ridiculous when i can buy a barrel for probably cheaper than filling up my car
9028105 historically speaking this will be the pre labor day spike we see
9028106 usually as history suggests after a major travel holiday prices tend to trend downwards
9028107 if it hits new orleans were gonna see close to 5 a gallon at the pumps
9028108 i hate to say it but it would be a great disruption

9028119 all residents should be taking steps to secure their homes and prepare for evacuation now
9028120 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9028121 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9028122 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
9028123 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production

9028170 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9028171 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9028172 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9028173 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9028174 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9028175 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9028176 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9028177 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9028178 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9028179 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

9028182 cienciano es due o de sus derechos deportivos y en las pr ximas horas esperamos entrar en contacto con los dirigentes del c diz para repatriar al volante peruano
9028183 en el caso de claudio he sido bien cauto al respecto me parec a que l no estaba involucrado en los temas que se dec an y hasta los dirigentes han dicho las declaraciones que ha dado han sido un exabrupto de su parte creo que lo mejor es decir esto cara a cara
9028184 as como yo he defendido la posici n de pizarro muchas veces me parece que esta vez se equivoc claudio es un chico inteligente y va a recapacitar por lo que el tiempo nos dar la raz n a todos los que pensamos que fue un exabrupto
9028185 claudio debe estar mortificado porque primero dijeron que no ten a que ver con el esc ndalo y lo hab an metido en esto porque era el capit n luego dijeron que s ten a que ver y al final la comisi n de justicia dijo que no han jugado un poco a la pi ata con l y con todos los jugadores al final los mismos que ped an que se castigue a estos muchachos quieren que jueguen

9028190 i think there will still be a need for a physical distribution starter and then services and additional content can be distributed online
9028191 we used to be below 1 gb but were now building games that have 8 9 10 gb and if broadband distribution is going to allow 10 gb to be distributed in half an hour well have games that are 100 gb

9028195 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9028196 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9028197 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9028198 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9028199 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9028200 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9028206 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9028211 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi

9028214 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9028215 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9028216 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti

9028228 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9028229 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9028230 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9028231 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9028232 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9028233 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9028234 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9028235 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9028236 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma

9028260 according to the church people i approached and underlined by the undertaker an atheist cannot be buried in donegal because the churches catholic church of ireland and presbyterian own the graveyards therefore unless one is willing to compromise ones beliefs by agreeing to a religious service it is impossible to be buried
9028261 such diversity is one of the glories of the catholic church

9028274 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9028275 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9028276 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9028277 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9028278 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9028279 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9028280 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9028281 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9028282 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9028283 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9028284 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9028285 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9028286 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9028287 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9028288 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9028289 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9028290 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9028291 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

9028300 eu acho que temos que trabalhar com muito carinho o que vamos fazer com o resultado deste petr leo para que o brasil saia ganhando como um todo
9028301 se os recursos do pr sal forem aquilo que imaginamos o brasil dentro de alguns anos se transformar em um grande produtor de petr leo n o podemos nos dar ao luxo de desperdi ar essa imensa riqueza n o porque tiramos bilhete premiado que vamos sair por a gastando dinheiro que ainda n o temos o pr sal o passaporte para o futuro

9028313 itll be really good to see charley up at the school again his enthusiasm for riding bikes is infectious and he really does add an extra dimension to the days training id never employ him as an instructor though he just rides around all day with a big grin on his face enjoying himself too much

9028320 before i acquiesce to the demands of another semester i want to send a quick thanks for one post a day its been a staple of my daily blog diet you added an important needed dimension to my summer thoughts
9028321 how ironic that on his 72nd birthday mccain has raised the question of whether his running make is prepared to be commander in chief and lead the country
9028322 they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path
9028323 to support any of the issues that they care about
9028324 were stoked to get on the road with these power metal legends there is much destruction and raging to come
9028325 i dont want my other daughter around her i dont feel safe in my own home
9028326 self you shouldnt have to open this door this door locks when you close it
9028327 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
9028328 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
9028329 there is some kind of engagement to have some understanding of where we are because its not clear whether the talks have collapsed or are still on
9028330 the mediator has to help us appreciate where we are in terms of locating a way forward
9028331 we are trying with mbeki to get zanu pf to be flexible because there has not been any indication of movement of flexibility on the part of zanu pf
9028332 just with the south african mediators there is no zanu pf
9028333 we hope the talks can lead to the finalisation of the political and outstanding matters so that we can start with a normalisation of the political economic and humanitarian situation in zimbabwe
9028334 unless there is a political solution we dont have the necessary framework to deal with the economic recovery package for zimbabwe and the humanitarian crisis
9028335 it will be determined by the progress made they will continue until all parties feel they have covered sufficient ground
9028336 priests and nuns are hiding out in the jungles because theyve no protection from police

9028342 its extremely powerful to those of us who know the majority of down syndrome babies are being killed before they are born
9028343 i am so excited i am ready to go get on the plane and just sit there until it takes off
9028344 this woman has a child that proves that she is what she says she is which is a pro life believer
9028345 shes beautiful to look at the men are going to love her she hunts she fishes she is an environmentalist
9028346 in all honesty i suspect that was one of the reasons that they turned to her
9028347 there are women who are bound and determined not to die before they see a woman in the white house
9028348 has reached beyond traditional republican and washington insiders and identified a first term female governor with an intriguing personal narrative
9028349 this will be an interesting experiment and palin may just attract disgruntled hillary supporters
9028350 it is history and i congratulate sen mccain for choosing a woman
9028351 all i can say is they must be really really worried about barack obamas appeal
9028352 a lot of the women were in favor of hillary clinton because of her stance on issues that are important to women im very proud to be an elected official whos a woman but just having ovaries doesnt qualify you for anything
9028353 sarah palin is an excellent choice for vice president she has a proven track record of making tough choices taking on corruption and implementing reforms in one of our countrys largest states
9028354 as a mother of five with a son in the military she understands firsthand the challenges that american families face like the impact of rising energy prices
9028355 and as governor of a large energy producing state she knows we can and must lessen our dependence on foreign oil through increased exploration and diversification of our energy portfolio
9028356 compared to joe bidens lifelong opposition to energy exploration her energy experience is proof that she is the right choice for this country
9028357 like sen mccain sarah knows the best way to grow our economy is by cutting taxes and controlling spending in washington
9028358 reaffirms sen mccains commitment to energy independence spending restraint and reforming the way washington works
9028359 gov palin supports an all of the above energy approach with first hand experience advocating it
9028360 she has a strong record of working to cut wasteful spending she is firmly dedicated to promoting strong families and protecting the most vulnerable in society gov palin will be a true agent of change who brings a breath of fresh air to washington from far outside the beltway
9028361 i think hillary clintons campaign stimulated a lot of interest among women voters and i think this is going to hit a chord
9028362 thought he needed to satisfy that wing of the party
9028363 i guess the difference is obama is asking to be president while the vice president is a heartbeat away but not exactly president
9028364 more importantly she has the judgment when you look at obamas judgment he has been wrong every single time
9028365 im looking forward to learning about what her record is on foreign policy
9028366 i think its good for republicans and good for the country to have a woman on the ticket
9028367 the vice presidential selection by mccains definition is supposed to be the very best person to be president of the united states after him if he thinks she is the best person thats just stunning its a reflection both on his judgment and on the hypocrisy of his campaign
9028368 look at all the money they spent trying to convince people barack obama doesnt have experience

9028437 understanding how they work will play a major role in inhibiting the survival of bacteria and could have applications as basic as cleansing hospital equipment and wards or helping to make food safer
9028438 these channels are found in mrsa and c difficile and this knowledge has not yet been exploited the future path is to find new chemicals and processes that exploit the importance of the channels to these bacteria
9028439 the system is mechanical the channel senses the pressure inside the bacteria and as a result the channel alters its shape and creates an opening releasing the pressure
9028440 the motion is just like that of a camera iris and being able to see this motion is an amazing discovery
9028441 not only is this a major step forward in scientific understanding of a fundamental process in biology but it paves the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria
9028442 it is vital to the bacteria that the channel fully closes and only opens at the right times as mistakes either way would be fatal
9028443 new chemicals designed to force channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria
9028444 slowing down the growth gives the bodys natural defences time to tackle its bacterial invader
9028445 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9028446 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january

9028450 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9028451 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9028452 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9028453 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9028454 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9028455 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9028456 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9028457 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9028458 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9028459 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9028460 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9028461 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9028462 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9028463 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9028464 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9028465 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9028466 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9028467 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9028468 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9028469 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this

9028471 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9028472 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9028473 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9028474 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9028475 no one works for someone we all just work together
9028476 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9028477 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9028478 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9028479 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9028480 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9028481 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9028482 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9028483 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9028484 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9028485 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9028486 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9028487 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9028488 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9028489 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9028490 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9028491 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9028492 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9028493 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9028494 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9028495 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9028496 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9028497 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9028498 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9028499 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9028500 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9028501 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9028502 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9028503 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9028504 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9028505 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9028506 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9028507 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9028508 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9028509 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9028510 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9028511 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9028512 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9028513 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9028514 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9028515 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9028516 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9028517 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9028518 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9028519 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9028520 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9028521 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9028522 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
9028523 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
9028524 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
9028525 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9028526 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9028527 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9028528 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9028529 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9028530 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9028531 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9028532 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9028533 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9028534 who is making what might be perceived as big studio movies with big stars but each one of his films has a signature hes an artist
9028535 there were movies we would have considered but they werent ready
9028536 until about four or five years ago we didnt show any studio connected films at all and the fall releases are not quite like last year when you had so many high profile films that were of oscar quality
9028537 i think we have a few that have a real theatrical potential
9028538 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9028539 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9028540 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9028541 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9028542 this was the pipe out the video they heard of problems
9028543 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9028544 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9028545 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children

9028568 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9028569 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9028570 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9028571 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9028572 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world

9028575 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9028576 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9028577 sarah palin is both principled and authentic as a governor she also brings an important balance of understanding of the critical domestic issues that is needed and that the democrats have ignored with their ticket
9028578 i think shes a fresh face which is something we need
9028579 i think she can help bring a new perspective to our party as we head into the election
9028580 as a republican woman i take immense pride in the fact that once again our party has demonstrated that is truly the party of change and the party of ideas it is an exciting day for our country

9028593 this is not an event this is not a project this is about building relationships
9028594 you could see the first day they were thinking to themselves who are these people
9028595 but as the days have passed their guard has dropped and its easier to start conversations with them
9028596 monday i just said hello and was having casual conversation with an officer and he just out of the blue said one problem i have always had with christianity is the trinity so we discussed it for quite some time and i brought him a book the next day today another volunteer said he saw him reading it
9028597 they are overwhelmed that we would do this for them and when they ask why its very easy to tell them
9028598 today we started handing out peacemaker bibles and several of them were so glad to receive them
9028599 you have to be sensitive to what these guys are going through
9028600 one day several of them had just come in from managing a protest and you could tell they were exhausted and really on edge they didnt need us to try to make conversation then they just needed a cold drink and a chance to unwind
9028601 this is the first time weve had this kind of operation
9028602 if we wanted something to eat back then we had to bring it in ourselves
9028603 our group had some police officers cheer for us when we walked in from the street today i know this is going to have a lasting impact
9028604 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
9028605 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
9028606 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
9028607 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
9028608 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
9028609 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope
9028610 if he obama stays eight years and then jeb bush says im running im with jeb
9028611 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven

9028628 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
9028629 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9028630 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9028631 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9028632 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9028633 that speech was amazing but its not going to change my mind
9028634 i talk to plenty of people like me who just wont accept an unqualified president
9028635 obama has said a lot of stuff but nothing with a concrete vision
9028636 i have heard at least some sensible things from senator mccain hes a comeback kind of guy and ive heard from many other people who are clearly leaning in his direction
9028637 had it been a different republican democrats would not have been able to consider defecting so easily
9028638 but given the perception that mccain is a moderate there is a good chance that some clinton supporters will defect to him
9028639 just the other night hillary clinton made a strong heartfelt case to her supporters and all americans for why they should join her in supporting barack obama for president americans across the country understand how urgently we need change not four more years of failed bush policies and weve been very pleased that so many who supported senator clinton in the primary have taken active roles in the obama campaign organizing raising money and most importantly talking to their friends and neighbors about the clear choice in this election

9028647 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
9028648 tonight tonight i say to the people of america to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
9028649 at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9028650 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
9028651 a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9028652 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
9028653 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9028654 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
9028655 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
9028656 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built
9028657 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9028658 finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
9028659 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made it clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
9028660 you know john mccain likes to say hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9028661 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
9028662 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose and thats what we have to restore
9028663 one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
9028664 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
9028665 this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
9028666 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
9028667 it is that promise that 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream
9028668 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
9028669 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
9028670 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9028671 i think that a lot of people are going to focus on it
9028672 would be very pleased and proud of what the democratic party and our nation is on the brink of doing
9028673 i feel that he and my mother are looking down today with a great big smile on their faces
9028674 one of those moments where no matter how you assess it america is moving far from where its ever been
9028675 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9028676 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9028677 put middle class americans first again and reward companies who create jobs in america instead of shipping them overseas
9028678 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
9028679 the positive thing about having any storm hit you it will reveal any kind of frailty in the system
9028680 its not worth putting your life at risk if you have the means to get out
9028681 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
9028682 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing
9028683 top ten list of books that make me want to quit writing because ill never write anything this good so why am i bothering
9028684 you can be a reformer and also be a conservative
9028685 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
9028686 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9028687 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9028688 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9028689 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9028690 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9028691 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9028692 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9028693 who are open to doing something on the production side
9028694 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9028695 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9028696 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9028697 e as portas foram se fechando uma a uma mas com o apoio de algumas pessoas poucas poucas mesmo consegui ao longo dos anos vencer a resist ncia
9028698 all the heavy lifting would be done by this afternoon
9028699 the hurricane disaster preparations will not interfere with the ongoing negotiations
9028700 some of the attacks are just out and out false for example suggesting that the bush administration hasnt invested in alternative or renewable energies
9028701 this president has been unfairly attacked across the board by many democrats for quite a while
9028702 best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief
9028703 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy
9028704 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9028705 he knows what its like in high political season and hes not going to respond to every attack
9028706 month end oriented and not tied to any specific input

9028713 if gustav continues on the forecast track at hurricane force a significant loss of oil and gas producing capacity may ensue in the worst instance potentially lasting for months
9028714 the forecast hasnt changed very much and remains looking very ominous for the energy production region and the upper gulf coast the upper texas coastline to louisiana remain most at risk to receive the brunt of this potentially very dangerous hurricane
9028715 relatively smooth sailing awaits gustav in the days ahead with explosive development probable
9028716 we continue to believe it is likely that gustav will approach intersect and impact the main energy infrastructure swath across the outer continental shelf
9028717 with both oil and gasoline inventories much lower than when katrina and rita hit the price consequences could be even worse this time any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9028718 there are a lot of things in the industry that have improved since the 04 and 05 seasons but at the end of the day its going to be a question of how destructive storms are and how powerful they are when they go through the gulf

9028722 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9028723 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9028724 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9028725 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9028726 for a man who is 72 years old and has had four bouts with cancer to have chosen someone so completely unqualified to become president is shockingly irresponsible
9028727 when certain people throw out ridiculous numbers you know theyre throwing out ridiculous numbers because they want to scare off competition or they want to make themselves seem invincible and that sort of nonsense
9028728 realistically if youre going into this space for the first time and you want to compete with wow and you want to compete with us because were going into that same space youve got to make sure that you have at least 100 million dollars

9028753 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us

9028757 we were also pleased that we were able to offer a day of normalcy to some survivors of the natural disasters and to honor iowans who provided assistance to iowans in trouble during those difficult weeks earlier this summer

9028759 i was here in the kitchen working on my computer at my desk when i heard a little bell in the distance sounded just like an ice cream truck and i thought thats weird an ice cream truck this time of day but i didnt think anything more about it and i went right back to my computer well the next thing you know i heard a little tap tap tap at the kitchen window and i looked up and there was a little round man wearing a white hat standing in the shrubs and motioning me to the window i raised the window just a bit and oh my goodness the sweet smell of something filled the air like cake or cookies or something yes i asked him are you here to check the meter no maam he said im the muffin man and i was wondering if youd like some muffins why yes i told him my little boy loves muffins what kind do you have he said he had blueberry and bran and so i said we would take six of each well he walked down the driveway to his little white truck and when he opened up the two little doors in the back oh my the aroma of fresh baked muffins filled the entire neighborhood the smell was so captivating that the birds fell right off the telephone lines he had a little bitty bakery right in the back of his truck can you imagine such a thing well he came back with the muffins and i handed him some money through the window i turned to set them down and when i looked up to thank him he was gone but for the sound of a little bell in the distance
9028760 i would not tease about something as serious as muffins

9028782 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

9028817 ifa 2008 le salon lectronique berlinois ouvre ses portes en grande forme
9028818 im excited about this season we have a great tournament schedule lined up and we are bringing in the strongest recruiting class ive ever had
9028819 this team will be young but very talented we will only have two weeks of practice and qualifying before our first event so getting our new players comfortable with the process quickly will be important
9028820 playing a national schedule helps prepare our team to play many types of courses often in different conditions when team members become comfortable with the process same game but always a different course they increase their confidence level as players as a result the team can achieve some special things as a professional golfer this is your life when a top recruit knows they will have that opportunity to test their game across the country it makes us an attractive program to join
9028821 the 2009 field for this years home tournament has been expanded to include 24 college teams making this the strongest field we have ever hosted fellow big east conference schools participating are louisville depaul cincinnati connecticut and marquette we have a unique opportunity this year by playing our home event at the same site as the big east championship only six weeks separate the two events so i would expect course conditions to be relatively the same and by having five conference schools at our home event it will present a great preview for this years championship
9028822 the team knows the golf course were familiar with the grasses and green speeds we are hosting our home event on the same course and well be able to compete against many of our conference schools during our event going into the championship we should have a good idea of what it will take to win
9028823 robby carl will return as a sophomore and have the lowest stroke average on the team for the returners i expect robby to continue to improve this year and begin focusing in on an individual tournament win raj nahal will return as a junior raj got off to a great start last year in the fall season i hope he will repeat that again this fall jake mckinley will be our only senior this year jake has a great work ethic and i expect that he will have a lot of influence over the younger players on the team chris tallman will also be a junior chris competed in three events as a sophomore but worked hard on his game over the summer my hope is that chris will get off to a good start and build confidence throughout the season our four freshmen alex donaldson grant gaugler rick kittelstad and luke leibel are all very talented they will all see a lot of competition this first year and any of them can emerge into a leader on the team it will be fun to watch how they push each other to be the best on the team
9028824 last season the program had five new players and a new coach the amount of growth that we were able to accomplish as a team was phenomenal we created an environment that will breed success in each area including academics practice workouts and competition we composed a plan for individual and team achievement we met some of our expectations and left some to be taken care of this season there are several tasks that need to be accomplished this year to continue the same rate of growth we encountered last year playing in the post season is no doubt an expectation that we will be working towards during each practice and in each competition we hope to surpass the academic records that were set last semester and i am interested in getting the team more involved in the community and having the community more involved with the team
9028825 as mentioned before we added five new players to the team last year plus we are adding two more this year so we will have several players that are transitioning to college life at usf the good side to that is we will have an entire roster that is so hungry to compete we have a great deal of talent and it will take an individual effort to develop each player to get them accustomed to a winning mindset
9028826 i am so excited about genn mendezs senior year and the lengths she is willing to go to make the most out of her last collegiate year to prepare for playing on tour she is coming off an incredible summer tournament schedule that included a win at the florida state womens match play qualifying for match play at the usga pub links in wisconsin she also finished in the top 10 at the florida state womens amateur jessica schnebly will also be exciting to watch as she broke the threshold of shooting 69 to finish second at the florida state womens amateur she is beginning to peak at the right time as are other players that have been working hard on swing changes throughout the summer such as emily vanetten and ana lopez jenna taylor and incoming freshman ploi desjubha have been competing locally each week while winning several events and staying competitive rachel edwards is an incoming transfer from daytona state after finishing 15th in nationals last year with the senior leadership from genn and jess and the steady improvements of the returners and the accomplishments of ploi and rachel usf is no doubt on the road to success
9028827 the kansas event will give us an opportunity to compete against some of the top ranked programs that fall into the central region usf has not really played many events outside of the east region and i feel that it is important in order to be nationally recognized our conference rival cincinnati hosts an event right here in our backyard in crystal river fla we will have the opportunity to play against several conference teams as well as florida teams we added the unc greensboro event in place of the furman event that we compete in every year due to some course improvements at furman i wanted to play in an event that had a similar strength of field to give our team the best competition that time of year heading into the pat bradley in which we won last year jmu is coming to florida to host a tournament at a great course called eagle landing in orange park fla the trend is for the schools up north to host events in florida during the early spring because of weather concerns it is pointless for us to try and seek better tournaments and better competition outside the state of florida during the early spring
9028828 it is important for usf to host our own event we are fortunate to have the support of the waterlefe golf community to host the usf waterlefe invitational as they have in years past it is an opportunity for us to play our entire roster first filling our five person team and then playing individuals it is a chance for our usf support staff and friends of the program to travel less than an hour to see us play
9028829 my goal is to have the most competitive tournament schedule we can we want to see fields that are deep with highly ranked teams it is only going to allow us to continue to grow stronger and give us better opportunities to move more quickly through the rankings if we play well
9028830 its a sad start to the beginning of their adult lives

9028836 he will continue and enhance our nations commendable global leadership in an area in which i am deeply involved the fight against aids tuberculosis and malaria including and this is very important a renewal of the battle against hiv and aids here at home
9028837 it was disappointing that on the occasion of this historic nomination that one of the greatest health threats facing america today was not more front and center during this years convention
9028838 this is my fourth democratic convention and it has never been so difficult to put hiv aids on the agenda at a time when the aids epidemic is worse in our nations capital than in many parts of sub saharan africa how can aids not be a featured as a priority by our democratic presidential nominee
9028839 disappointed that there was not a specific call to action by the presidential or vice presidential nominees to end the aids epidemic in america
9028840 obama has been a leader on hiv aids here in illinois and i hope that he will continue to personally address the issue during this presidential campaign
9028841 lately weve recognized it is a problem in other countries but while weve been tackling aids overseas weve forgotten about the home front
9028842 its time we demand better results from our domestic response to aids
9028843 that is why senator obama has called for a national aids strategy we have to have a plan of action to tackle aids in america
9028844 well talk about how do you say something to someone without them feeling defensive
9028845 we talk about forgiveness and commitment we try to make it fun

9028863 oils gone up too much because people were buying it for all the wrong reasons like not wanting to hold on to the dollar or worrying about putting money in the bank
9028864 barring a major disaster we expect oil prices could go below 100 maybe by the end of this year or even faster as its obvious that the trend for demand is falling off pretty dramatically
9028865 the question i have to ask is whether the storm is going to do more damage to supply or more damage to demand

9028932 never before in our history have americans been called upon to face three grave threats to our very existence any one of which could destroy us we face a disintegrating economy a weakened defense and an energy policy based on the sharing of scarcity
9028933 i will not stand by and watch this great country destroy itself under mediocre leadership that drifts from one crisis to the next eroding our national will and purpose we have come together here because the american people deserve better from those to whom they entrust our nations highest offices and we stand united in our resolve to do something about it

9028948 we are now competing against companies we were not competing against in the past
9028949 list companies should stress that we have longtime direct marketing knowledge that new companies dont have
9028950 i think there will be a certain core constitu ency who will always respond to direct mail

9028955 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off and look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work

9028992 can anyone look at our reduced standing in the world today and say lets have four more years of this
9028993 when you run with your girlfriends its a great way to clear your mind and you get a really great chance to talk to your friends i just find it very therapeutic
9028994 i started running because i had just had my daughter and i had a quest to fit into my pants again
9028995 we started out small with a few miles and you walk a little and you run a little after a short time we thought we should start setting some goals
9028996 so we did a race in long beach calif and then a half marathon in phoenix and then we did a mothers day race in santa barbara calif
9028997 we run that day and the next day we spend wine tasting
9028998 what better way to have a vacation than to meet with friends in a beautiful or exciting location do a race together and not feel guilty about indulging once its over
9028999 ive traveled to the boston marathon with a bunch of girlfriends
9029000 its very social and it also cuts down on expenses like the hotel and cab fares
9029001 its definitely a fun goal to have while training its still a challenge to organize everything at home for the kids but we know how good it is for our husbands to do it all for a few days
9029002 im all about having fun and this is a way i can do both
9029003 the trip is more fulfilling for us we go there with a purpose whats fun is seeing your friends accomplish their goals
9029004 the best part is the bonding as you tough out the long runs and cheer each other across the finish line
9029005 then you go out and party with a real reason to celebrate something big
9029006 e una grande gara tra due squadre che hanno due tifoserie appassionate sembra quasi un derby sudamericano sulla carta siamo sfavoriti ma sono certo che ce la giocheremo alla pari il napoli in queste occasioni riesce sempre a sorprendere sembrer quasi di rivivere il clima di coppa dei campioni di 20 anni fa la citt ed i tifosi si meritavano questo e sono orgoglioso che il napoli sia arrivato sin qui
9029007 i have been reading poems romances vision literature legends myths all my life i know what they are like i know that not one of them is like this
9029008 indeed if the transdniestr border guards didnt have a vested financial interest bribes in allowing visitors to pass the area would probably be inaccessible to all but the most determined of souls
9029009 his sons vladimir and oleg have repeatedly been accused by moldovan state propaganda of being involved in everything from drugs trafficking to weapons smuggling and running the nations largest companies as well as the governments customs organization mafia style there is no basis to these accusations
9029010 we like to have a good time but there are other schools that do it harder than us
9029011 its ironic though because last year they wanted to crack down is what they said our president here really wanted to cut down everything
9029012 but i think its really kind of ironic that we came back and improved our rating as the top party school
9029013 yes we have a very good athletic program theres no question about that i also know that our students are very very smart so they may not have to study so much but i also know that its a self select population that fills this survey out
9029014 fewer students indicate they participate in binge drinking there are fewer cases referred to the student judicial system for adjudication that have to do with alcohol
9029015 and hopefully this is a positive sign there are fewer alcohol related transports to our emergency rooms

9029046 se ha tomado la decisi n definitiva en el ministerio hemos recibido la orden y romperemos las relaciones con la federaci n de rusia
9029047 georgia ya no tendr en rusia ni rusia en georgia la anterior gran representaci n que se hac a cargo de la labor pol tica
9029048 esta decisi n no significa que se suspenden definitivamente los contactos entre los ministerios de asuntos exteriores de ambos estados pues tales contactos ser n posibles en territorio de terceros pa ses
9029049 conservamos el consulado pues seg n la convenci n de viena la ruptura de las relaciones diplom ticas no significa la ruptura autom tica de las relaciones consulares
9029050 que se har n cargo de atender a los conciudadanos en el otro pa s y de tratar asuntos humanitarios
9029051 y se mostr su pesimismo sobre el futuro al responder a una pregunta sobre cu ndo podr a reanudarse la
9029052 aunque precis que no se hab a recibido a n ning n
9029053 la posible ruptura de las relaciones no es la elecci n de rusia y toda la responsabilidad por ello recaer sobre georgia

9029055 we encountered heavy smoke from the two rear bay doors
9029056 people would definitely be surprised at how venomous fish are
9029057 because humans live on land they dont think of fish as venomous

9029062 i have spoken to fabio capello about the situation he asked me how steven was and it was a good conversation everything was positive between us and i have explained to him the timing and when he will be fit
9029063 we had no option but to have the operation done now there will be another international break soon anyway and we could not wait any longer
9029064 perhaps the most daring vice presidential pick in recent american history

9029066 alaska gov sarah palin to meet with mccain vp search team
9029067 theres no reason in mccain waiting to see what the dems do first insofar as his picking palin as vp because no matter who obama picks palin is by far and i mean far the best pick for mccain and the gop especially in this time of gop woes
9029068 the triumph came in alaska where sarah palin a politician of eye popping integrity was elected governor
9029069 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9029070 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9029071 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9029072 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling

9029074 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9029075 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges
9029076 id rather go moose hunting than be involved with politics
9029077 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
9029078 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9029079 patrick ewing will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9029080 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9029081 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me it has always been my dream to play for this team
9029082 my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9029083 we were trying to get picks in the first round and he wouldve been one of the guys in my mind i think he could be a good addition to an nba team because hes a glue guy
9029084 we are able to perform highly complicated procedures through minimally invasive means
9029085 robotic techniques are becoming the standard of care in this field and many patients need no medication and experience no pain the day after surgery

9029100 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9029101 the use of the darkly comedic rooster may arouse the wrath of congressional watchers who recoil from uses of non serious spokespeople or in this case spokesfoul
9029102 the goal of the my time to quit campaign is to encourage people to quit smoking
9029103 with unbranded ads you dont have the fair balance requirement
9029104 imagine paying millions to run that ad campaign and having to use up 30 seconds to list all the problems
9029105 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9029106 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9029107 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9029108 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9029109 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9029110 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9029111 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9029112 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9029113 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9029114 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9029115 i liked it everything about it i just liked my work
9029116 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9029117 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9029118 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9029119 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9029120 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9029121 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9029122 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9029123 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9029124 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9029125 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9029126 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9029127 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9029128 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9029129 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9029130 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9029131 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9029132 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9029133 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9029134 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9029135 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9029136 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9029137 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9029138 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9029139 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9029140 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9029141 theres a special treat awaiting all fans of the big bobby car on the internet under www simba dickie group de
9029142 they seem to be excited about walking around and shopping
9029143 i liked it everything about it i just liked my work
9029144 push for the six point cease fire plan to be implemented faithfully
9029145 thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
9029146 if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
9029147 if he felt he was gaining weight hed work out as hard as he could to drop it
9029148 an exemplary life up until the time of the offenses and even after
9029149 judges dont like to be accused of making a mistake
9029150 we believe that the system works better if such errors are fixed promptly and efficiently without the need for wasting resources the defendants or the governments on appeal
9029151 for a long time we thought it was our own private business how we feed ourselves but now we understand there are consequences
9029152 a lot of people dont like to cook they like to nuke
9029153 we do live in a society where our time is so valuable that we dont sit and enjoy meals like our forefathers did
9029154 the farm bill is making very very few people successful the vast majority are hurting
9029155 the big commodity regions of the country are becoming poorer and poorer we have to reverse that
9029156 energy health care climate change you cannot make progress on those three issues without addressing food
9029157 you sliced up some tomatoes with some of their olive oil cheese and prosciutto and you just put this dinner together and it was beautiful
9029158 thats the one thing i dont want slow food to go to is that elitism cooking where it gets so complicated and its almost like wine snobbery
9029159 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9029160 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9029161 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9029162 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9029163 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9029164 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9029165 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9029166 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9029167 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9029168 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9029169 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9029170 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9029171 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9029172 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9029173 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9029174 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9029175 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9029176 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9029177 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9029178 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9029179 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9029180 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9029181 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9029182 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9029183 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9029184 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9029185 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9029186 in the course of adjusting lot groups offer to all the needs of our passengers lot polish airlines invite all the enthusiasts of low fare flights to its website www lot com
9029187 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9029188 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9029189 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9029190 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

9029195 despite the animosity and hatred that exists between asian societies and contributing to it vista office and outlook 2007 are a nightmare
9029196 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9029197 i didnt get where i is today without recognising a mighty fine house
9029198 many people are sick of hearing about it and this just seems to be cashing in on the story i do not think many people in the town will care if the programme comes back or not
9029199 i think this shows how short of imagination these tv people really are if this is the best they can come up with i think it is time the story was left alone
9029200 you are having me on i dont think it is right that someones crime could be used as an excuse to bring back an old television programme
9029201 we are actively looking at whether it could have a role again on the bbc it is very zeitgeisty

9029203 this international collaborative will bind the u s australia and iceland to work together to accelerate the development of geothermal energy bringing this clean domestic and natural energy to the market in the near term to confront the serious challenges of climate change and energy security

9029205 we have high expectations of finding oil in the dreki area since scientific research has indicated that valuable oil resources may be found there
9029206 we therefore urge all parties interested in new oil fields in northern areas to attend the conference in reykjavik
9029207 the uk and ireland are highly attractive destinations for illegal immigrants and organised crime oc groups who facilitate illegal immigration
9029208 both countries are favourite destinations because of a flourishing economy and consequent demand for workers particularly in low skilled sectors and the image of easy access to health welfare and education systems
9029209 nigerian oc groups for generations present in amongst others the uk and the netherlands and responsible for various forms of fraud are now also discovered in ireland
9029210 this allows the use of genuine documents instead of falsified documents to apply for access to a school recently also bogus schools established by the oc group themselves help in obtaining the visa applications by providing the necessary documents

9029219 one of the recurring themes in the history of the public service commission is its ability to adapt to new challenges while staying true to its mandate of protecting merit and non partisanship in the federal public service
9029220 i am reminded of the commissions work in helping re integrate veterans providing opportunities for women opening executive doors for francophones and ensuring canadians are served in both official languages

9029239 as the chairman of seanergy i am very proud that as of today we will be an operating company in this attractive shipping sector our strategic vision is to position seanergy among the shipping industry leaders and generate shareholder value for the long term
9029240 the support by our sponsors to make our business combination happen has been unprecedented and indicates tangibly their belief in the positive fundamentals of the dry bulk sector and their faith in seanergys management to deliver shareholder value for the long term
9029241 seanergy commences its operations at a time when the dry bulk sector enjoys strong fundamentals with robust demand and attractive freight rates our strong cash flow generation due to the attractive charter rates we have secured for our initial fleet enables us to support a dividend payout of 64 of our distributable cash flow while retaining the rest for growth given our moderate leverage access to bank financing and expected capital inflow from the conversion of warrants we believe that seanergy is strategically positioned to take advantage of the positive market environment
9029242 legislation is often introduced that adds new rules regulations and fees for businesses without any real cost benefit analysis taking place if the state were a business it would be out of business the state needs to make tough decisions regarding the consolidation of services and departments and restructuring education police fire and other services on a county basis

9029254 in the industries i work in if you have something that critical you generally build more redundancy
9029255 if this faa outage happened at a power plant id be telling them to open up their checkbook and expect to be fined
9029256 dont happen on a mass scale or a regular basis
9029257 we are making sure people are getting from one place to another
9029258 we should see significant improvements by the end of september which should prevent the type of problem we had on tuesday
9029259 its common you see it in retail too its the whole dont fix it if it aint broke thing
9029260 its unfortunate because its very reactive and it typically winds up costing you more if you do fix on fail it usually costs you more
9029261 you need to do a good analysis about whether this is acceptable risk
9029262 one of the things the government is betting on is the fact that if theres a failure its not a safety issue
9029263 from time to time we are going to have a glitch but its a tradeoff
9029264 would i like to see more modern equipment in the system sure but most folks would not want to see their taxes tripled to pay for new technology every two years
9029265 how could i have got so low im embarrassed to tell you so i laid around this old place i hardly ever washed my face

9029270 im sure a few might but if thats the case in any numbers it will surely make the point that american politics today are more about the optics and the demographics than actual policy
9029271 you never know this may turn out to be an inspired choice on mccains part but i have the sneaking feeling that his curve ball may curve back on him like one of those australian wooden frisbees
9029272 washington ani competing with other actresses is not what american actress jessica alba is concerned about as she believes that they should stand together and seek equality with their male counterparts
9029273 there are a lot more men making a lot more money and headlining movies than women and the more of us who can come up and do that the better i want my friends to produce direct act write all of it i think being competitive defeats the whole female movement i want to be encouraging to my girlfriends totally
9029274 we favor free people and free markets and that includes free and flexible labor markets
9029275 most people who self identify as free market conservatives claim to share this belief and usually they do
9029276 seems to be when the topic turns to immigration no self respecting free market advocate would ever dream of supporting laws that interrupt the free movement of goods and services across our national borders
9029277 but when it comes to laws that hamper the free movement of workers who produce those goods and services too many conservatives today abandon their free market principles
9029278 all the heavy lifting would be done by this afternoon
9029279 oh no im fine im full i just dont have room for even a small bite of that flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce
9029280 why not sure ill have a glass of wine tonight
9029281 juries really just dont question blood they expect scientific evidence
9029282 this individual might have gone through a trial and potentially could have been convicted but for the fact that his blood was drawn and analyzed
9029283 it removes any pretense of a neutral magistrate and an objective ruling
9029284 if they refuse to provide a sample of blood to the police that is when we get involved
9029285 we draft a search warrant and present it to the judge and if the judge signs it we give it to the nurse and take the suspects blood
9029286 they are not pulling over people and arresting them and taking blood that couldnt be further from the truth
9029287 alcohol is a big concern this time of year because this is the last big recreational weekend of the summer
9029288 theres someone out there right now who is in a job they dont want and they dont know how to get out
9029289 i brought my five year old daugther to east coast beach near marine parade ntuc underpass on 28 jun 2008 around 3 15pm and saw this man swimming in the sea and thereafter he decided to take off his swimwear exposing himself
9029290 he later walked to the beach naked to put this swim gear on a bench before going back to swim again
9029291 the whole eposide lasted about 15 minutes before he walked back to the bench to wear his gear
9029292 i was surprised that there were some young ladies there but none kicked a fuss over his action
9029293 at mcdonalds we are committed to providing our customers with quality food choices at great value
9029294 in meeting our customers lifestyle needs and changing tastes we are constantly evolving our menus with new flavours
9029295 this also means that some menu items may be removed to accommodate new flavours from time to time
9029296 we thank our customers for taking the time to write in with their feedback on the garlic chilli sauce
9029297 our customers feedback is very important to us and will be taken into consideration as best as we can as we continually look to enhancing their meal experience
9029298 given the onerous burden of mps and the importance of their constitutional role do we really want them to take on more work and add to their many serious responsibilities five mps may be able to carry out the work of six but there will be a strain rather than peak performance
9029299 i do not doubt their dedication but we are all mortal and finite beings and fatigue will set in at some stage i am sure we all agree that singapore citizens deserve the best of their representatives with a full house and all hands on deck
9029300 to me the response of the grassroots leaders and the residents whom i had met is a great assurance they gave us a strong mandate at the last ge general election and they knew that we would honour and respect that mandate even after the demise of one mp
9029301 they are confident that their interest and welfare will be taken care of none have raised the issue of a by election
9029302 sir we are here today debating the nature of democracy in singapore democracy is about the people about how they have the power and the people have spoken they have spoken their voice rings loud and clear and they want a by election
9029303 in other words who calls for the by election is it the pm or the mp with this motion the power to call a by election is placed in the hands of one mp whether in the grc or smc single member constituency our laws do not extend such privileges to any single member whether minority or otherwise
9029304 to me the response of the grassroots leaders and the residents whom i had met is a great assurance they gave us a strong mandate at the last ge general election and they knew that we would honour and respect that mandate even after the demise of one mp
9029305 every component is coming together to produce a really big storm
9029306 i see a category 3 easily and conditions are there for it to become a category 4 or 5
9029307 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9029308 john mccains selection of sarah palin raises serious questions about his judgment why when the country is fighting two wars facing an uncertain economy and an energy crisis did senator mccain make the choice that he did why with so many other qualified women and men in his party did john mccain choose sarah palin sarah palin is not the right choice
9029309 after the great success of the democratic convention the choice of sarah palin is surely a hail mary pass it is a real role of the dice and shows how john mccain karl rove et al realize what a strong position the obama biden team and democrats in general are in in this election certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling i particularly look forward to the biden palin debate in missouri
9029310 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that governor palin is not qualified to be vice president she has a record of accomplishment that senator obama simply cannot match governor palin has spent her time in office shaking up government in alaska and actually achieving results whether its taking on corruption passing ethics reform or stopping wasteful spending and the bridge to nowhere senator obama has spent his time in office running for president
9029311 estamos en la parte m s activa de la temporada que va entre mediados de agosto y mediados de octubre

9029313 he had his own schtick and it was very beautiful and it actually made the moment even that much better
9029314 it wasnt simply being on the bridge it really felt very emotional
9029315 weve got people flying in from all over the world
9029316 because they were closing we decided to do it now
9029317 its really a shame and from the people we talk to staff and people alike it seems that everybodys kind of puzzled why its closing because it seems very popular
9029318 theres a tremendous amount of sadness as you can imagine this is a place that no one wants to end including our employees
9029319 it goes beyond just a great group of staff its a group of people whove invested everything they had to make this as realistic and special as possible
9029320 we had to come in one more time before it went away

9029324 catalu a no aceptar un mal acuerdo de financiaci n hecho deprisa y corriendo
9029325 al final tendr que haber situaciones de multilateralidad ya que no descartamos que el conjunto de las comunidades aut nomas participen de criterios que puedan compartir
9029326 en todo caso ha insistido creo que tendr amos que mirar con atenci n y alertar a la sociedad catalana para que nadie cometiese la tentaci n de promover un tipo de loapa ley org nica de armonizaci n del proceso auton mico aprobada en 1982 financiera

9029330 que ya practican una total libertad tarifaria en los vuelos internacionales
9029331 no aceptaremos un mal acuerdo no nos levantaremos de la mesa pero tampoco aceptaremos ninguna imposici n no se puede responder con imposiciones a las razones de catalu a no se puede hacer y no dejaremos que se haga

9029375 i am pro life and i believe that marriage should only be between and man and a woman i am opposed to any expansion of gambling in alaska

9029418 i like being flexed out and they are putting me in motion sometimes
9029419 we were lucky that corey harkey was ready to play and can be another point of attack tight end it gives us a little more versatility
9029420 when the republicans attack repeat the attack over and over when the democrats attack attack the democrats it explains everything were observing on cable news this week
9029421 i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer

9029424 we believe they tumbled or fell about 200 feet the child was described as seriously injured and the man less so
9029425 the second helicopter recovered the lady who had fallen and took her to hospital
9029426 it was wet and slippy they were just below the cloud line around 2 000 feet up the mountain it is quite steep there
9029427 two other adults were taken down the mountain by keswick mountain rescue team
9029428 my job is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable
9029429 i find it really unfortunate that you use your front row position bestowed upon you by your colleagues to make such statements it is an honor and a priviledge to be in a briefing room and to suggest that we at the united states are killing innocent people is just absurd and very offensive
9029430 there is really a lot of mixed information being thrown at the market
9029431 the chicago number totally surprised the market and the university of michigan to a lesser extent
9029432 the reports showed that there is life in other parts of the economy signs of hope
9029433 unless inflation prices moderate the fed could be forced to raise rates
9029434 starts to hit refineries that could feed through into oil prices and may weigh on the u s dollar
9029435 success is not the key to happiness happiness is the key to success if you love what you are doing you will be successful
9029436 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
9029437 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
9029438 we must not be part of the redrawing of lines in europe
9029439 we support georgias territorial integrity that means that the leaders of the abkhaz and south ossetians are not on the same legal grounds as the democratically elected leaders of georgia or the leader of russia
9029440 war propagandists for hire croatia bosnia use western public relations firms to win support
9029441 a positive croatian image to members of congress administration officials and the news media
9029442 that was quite a change from the previous year when the emphasis was on the integrity of the borders getting former secretary of state lawrence eagleburger to name names and talk of war crimes trials was obviously a breakthrough
9029443 back then the croats took an incredibly brutal action and killed many civilians but the west pretended they did not see it actually the u s helped plan and equip the genocidal operation now the georgians have done the same while using the heavy artillery and grad missile systems
9029444 the difference is that then president slobodan milosevic did nothing to help serbs in croatia while the russian authorities ordered their army to enter south ossetia
9029445 south ossetians began seeking more sovereignty in 1989 for their autonomous republic in north central georgia but the georgian parliament abolished south ossetias autonomous status
9029446 the kosovo precedent has driven us to more actively seek our rights
9029447 if they recognized kosovo they would be setting a precedent for south ossetia and other breakaway provinces
9029448 bush administration officials in turn stated that kosovo was a unique case
9029449 apparently believing that they could define what kosovos independence meant to others
9029450 if the us opts not to respect the principle of sovereignty it encourages other powers to do the same thus undermining state sovereignty the world over
9029451 bajram rexhepi a so called mayor of kosovska mitrovica said that albanians will self organize and put serbs in the city under the control if unmik will not do that
9029452 a reversion to not just cold war politics it is a 19 century way of doing politics
9029453 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire not the soviet union but the russian empire
9029454 its a reversion to not just post colonial politics it is a seventh century way of doing politics
9029455 the return of russia portends a shift in the balance of political forces in the middle east that for the moment at least appears to weaken the american and pro western side of the balance and to strengthen the iranian side
9029456 all arabs are mad at georgia because it sent its troops to iraq and took part in the occupation of that arab land
9029457 if it werent for russia georgian forces would still be in iraq
9029458 i hope russia companies will take part in the bidding
9029459 lukoil is welcome to bid for the service contract at the second or third stage of the tender in march or september
9029460 did someone within the u s suggest that iraq reach out to russia as a show of good will or did russia want to show that they are indispensable in the middle east that they are a player
9029461 the only danger is if there are deals to sell of some of that infrastructure to russia power plants and such
9029462 that would come with greater political influence which would not fit in with our policies in the middle east
9029463 washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia
9029464 growing feeling among some officials in the bush administration that perhaps the united states cannot have it all and may have to choose its priorities
9029465 if someone went to the russians and said ok kosovo for iran wed have a deal
9029466 all serbs are nazis croats should have exterminated the serbs

9029478 the kremlin has given an impetus to processes that no one is capable of controlling and it looks as though russia may turn out to be the principal victim of a new world order or more precisely disorder at some point events will evolve spontaneously since moscows recognition of georgias autonomous regions is setting in motion a mechanism that revises the basic principle of territorial integrity in the post war world

9029489 managing transport challenges when oil prices rise was commissioned by the governments new zealand transport agency as a response to rising petrol prices the report calls for a fundamental shift in the governments transport solutions away from building more roads toward investing in alternative transport and maintaining existing roads
9029490 unfortunately far too often development patterns result in urban sprawl that creates an unnecessary increase in transportation related greenhouse gas emissions
9029491 paying attention to the underlying development path offers the potential for the kinds of transformative changes in emission causing activities that will be required to achieve climate change goals

9029494 reasonable allowances for what are often problems with a young persons credit history or other low level offense
9029495 recruitment hiring and retention have all been problems for departments in many cities
9029496 we believe the quality of the bureaus current officers is an indication that the hiring process and training process is producing individuals with a strong commitment to community policing
9029497 the bureau has taken numerous steps to hire more police officers among those steps have been
9029498 a reduction in the educational requirement for the position of police officer
9029499 streamlined or significantly altered the hiring process to devote resources to
9029500 improved efforts to recruit lateral transfers including multnomah county deputies as well as experienced law enforcement officers from other agencies
9029501 soon after her appointment chief sizers style of leadership and genuine accessibility began to influence the possibility of change within the portland police bureau having been appointed in the aftermath of several highly controversial police shootings chief sizer guided the bureau in implementing a more organic and intentional approach to building relationships
9029502 was frequently dominated by complaint sessions referencing issues better handled by an independent police review board
9029503 the chief and the bureau are already actively engaged in the dialogue about how to transition the racial profiling committee under the mantle of the office of human relations and in a more positive direction
9029504 collaboration with cjac has saved money focused resources and created innovative solutions
9029505 white women are a problem thats you know we all live with that
9029506 looks like the glass ceiling hasnt been broken by hillary clinton but by senator mccain

9029511 the only way of really finding out a mans true character is to play golf with him
9029512 in no other walk of life does the cloven hoof so quickly display itself
9029513 going for the green on the links with canadas business and political elite
9029514 the whole point of it was to be as honest as i could be with the people i was playing with
9029515 thats the essence of it you hope to show a side of these guys that youre just not going to see any other way
9029516 hes one of my two favourite stories in the book hes manic and he comes across as manic
9029517 people probably wont know gerry but the truth of the matter is theyve probably gone to see something gerrys put on theyve probably seen a rolling stones show or u2 or gone to see david bowie or whomever
9029518 shes remarkable just because shes such an interesting personality and has so many interests wine photography architecture and corporate governance
9029519 and you probably learn something about the guy at some point whether you learn everything about his business or not you learn something more important you learn about the guy himself you learn about what makes him tick what interests him
9029520 he hits it right across the water right at the green and he makes it across just a dead yank
9029521 balsillies got the three wood in his hand he goes and sticks the three wood back in the bag and pulls out the driver he cant be one upped
9029522 you know all these guys are competitive you know thats how they got to where they are but rarely do you see it demonstrated in such a clear way
9029523 in a corporate setting you and i are never going to see how that comes out because were never going to be invited when theyre negotiating a 30 million deal to take something over
9029524 the tricky part about it for me is how do you play a halfway decent golf game take notes and think up questions to continue the conversation
9029525 he said theres a lot of f words in this how many other people swear in the book thompson laughs as he recalls barads reaction
9029526 the idea was to raise awareness among families especially because this is the first layer of barrier and to help people to realize they are not alone and be able to face the problem
9029527 the cast i worked with had no cinematic training which i though would be useful to access things that a professional actor wouldnt be capable
9029528 usually an actor is trained to show things i thought it was important to show what a person was hiding
9029529 right up to the day of shooting i hadnt found a suitable character to play that role and i even thought about cutting her out
9029530 as it is a very masculine and male oriented society the thought of really coming out and revealing that fact they wanted to come out and revealing they are not a real male has real problems all of the women i met who wanted to be male didnt want this to be known for them it was a real problem coming out
9029531 if theres a big rain event ambulances may have a problem getting to us
9029532 theyre setting themselves up for a nightmare that area floods way more so than where charity was
9029533 if the streets flood we cant get to them with the things they need
9029534 we have everything in the hospital that we need to run it
9029535 were really focusing on a group of our folks committed to staying in the hospial and working in shifts during the storm
9029536 for 20 years we have been preparing for the perfect storm
9029537 all of our generators are on the third floor or above
9029538 for katrina we had to use a football field at the high school next door to land copters
9029539 we will discharge as many kids a possible before the storm
9029540 im not leaving camerons side i will hunker down with him on storm night
9029541 the hospital has changed a lot of things since katrina the nurses doctors and surgeons nurse have been in direct contact with me letting me know what to expect its really comforting because the cardiac specialty team stays here in the storm and camerons cardiologist and the cardiothoracic surgeon live within walking distance a couple blocks from the hospital
9029542 patients have been calling to find dialysis clinics in the areas they are going to evacuate to
9029543 and believe me i will find a place in this book to get to for dialysis
9029544 they will automatically have my medical records there im not worried about the hurricane honey
9029545 we have a plan in place to assist those patients
9029546 we realize babies have their own timetable and will continue to be born patients suffering with chest pain and possible heart attacks will continue to present to our emergency room and require special procedures
9029547 ive never had problems with my other pregnancies so i was shocked
9029548 it took a while to open up the book that the doctor gave me about children with down syndrome
9029549 i dont think there was ever a question that they were going to have the baby
9029550 i was just your average hockey mom in alaska coaching some basketball on the side
9029551 my agenda was to stop wasteful spending cut property taxes and put the people first
9029552 i think she is a person who holds her principles very near and dear
9029553 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
9029554 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons

9029576 the killing of swamiji was most unfortunate incident and unwarranted he was a true social reformer we all missed guruji of chakapa for a longtime his security concerns downplayed
9029577 christians have killed swamiji we would give a befitting reply to it very soon
9029578 we would forced to opt violent protest if action not taken against the killers
9029579 we have called a 12 hour shut down on monday protesting against the killing
9029580 never have fears of death when you are working for the cause of the motherland
9029581 the killing of swamiji was most unfortunate incident and unwarranted he was a true social reformer we all missed guruji of chakapa for a longtime his security concerns downplayed
9029582 christians have killed swamiji we would give a befitting reply to it very soon
9029583 we would forced to opt violent protest if action not taken against the killers
9029584 we have called a 12 hour shut down on monday protesting against the killing
9029585 christian militants have killed swamiji not maoists police as well as the orissa government trying to cover up the matter and sheltering the church sponsored militants
9029586 we have also demanded to set up a commission to look into the activities of churches missionaries church sponsored ngos foreign funding to ngos working for conversion and strict implementation of anti conversion laws
9029587 it seems orissa government is patronizing conversion activities and it is also under pressure from the churches
9029588 we cant keep silent sadhus and santhas from across the country would march towards orissa chief ministers office in bhubaneswar
9029589 from nepal to kashmir to kandhamal they only want to eliminate hindus in a country like india majority feeling persecuted under the upas rule at centre
9029590 whilst freedom of religion is a basic human right proselytism receives universal condemnation proselytism is defined as the use of unscrupulous methods of persuasion such as material inducements psychological pressure or spiritual threats to compel a person to change his or her religion proselytism attacks other religious beliefs and practices and proclaims that its own religion is the only way to salvation it is often supported by financial resources and marketing techniques that make local religious activities seem second rate and inferior
9029591 it turns out that staines and his wife gladys regularly filed despatches for a journal in australia tidings
9029592 besides his involvement with the leprosy house staines was also involved in missionary work the missionary work of staines has come to light from the various desptches sent by him to australia which are published in the newsletter tidings staines also used to take part in baptism ceremonies however it is the despatchs sent by staines to australia in the newsletter tidings that make it clear that staines was also involved in active propogation of his religion apart from his social work it is also clear from the said despatches that conversions were taking place in jungle camps it is obvious therefore that staines was both a social worker engaged in the treatment and eradication of leprosy amongst the poorest of the poor and also a missionary driven by a deep commitment to his religion and the belief that he should spread its tenets amongst the people in the area his missionary activities did lead to conversions of tribals to his faith
9029593 first we thought someone is bursting crackers and so we ran towards the main gate then we saw and heard people screaming and running there was blood all over the place swamiji and mataji and others were lying in blood i shouted and ran away we all started running here and there
9029594 swamiji ran into the toilet to save himself and shut the door mataji who hid behind the door was shot first the miscreants then broke open the toilet door and sprayed bullets
9029595 i rushed towards the main gate along with others only to see some men running around and loud cracking noise i heard the cries of swamiji and others i saw other swamijis running here and there i was scared and ran inside the hostel room with another girl we sat huddled together until after a long time one of the swamijis came and escorted us out of the room
9029596 i too rushed out after hearing the noise i saw bodies lying in blood i touched swamijis feet who was lying in the bathroom it was still warm but he did not move nor did mataji who lay inside the room
9029597 we had written 30 times to the state government that swamijis and our lives were at stake that we were being threatened by christian leaders before the incident we got a letter threatening to kill swamiji we formally complained to the police and district authorities they sent only four baton wielding constables
9029598 not a single minister visited us after the incident not even of our bjp the collector comes sometimes he gave us rice dal and sugar for the children
9029599 the maoists can never do this it is christians who threaten us everyday and they did this
9029600 no one called us for any meeting or to take part in any peace process as long as are kept out the violence will continue
9029601 the state central committee of the maoists had no knowledge of this
9029602 we have a much more extensive role in the broader world of advertising
9029603 we are working with dozens of major television advertisers advertising agencies television networks and cable players on a number of very compelling solutions that could help check what is becoming the most important issue facing the economics of the media business
9029604 one of the very important teachings from this data is unlike what many in the media industry may have assumed or wished for all viewers are fast forwarding ads at high rates
9029605 there are currently around 25 million households with dvrs most analysts estimate there will be over 50 million in the next two to three years
9029606 the issues related to fast forwarding through commercials are only going to become more evident and dire unless there is widespread adoption of ad solutions that are specifically molded for a world of dvr viewing
9029607 we dont see this ruling having anything to do with our business relationships with the cable world
9029608 in our view the cable industry has inadequate capacity for broad scale deployment of a network dvr solution its beyond the realm of most cable operators capacity

9029641 senator joe biden may be one of the only u s politicians that can get iraqs feuding sunni shiite and kurdish politicians to agree but not in a good way
9029642 a senior obama adviser speaking on condition of anonymity said his boss has expressed impatience with what he calls a reverence inside his campaign for his message of change and new politics
9029643 this is the first ill vote for a republican president or work for one
9029644 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given they have created the space for political reconciliation
9029645 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same

9029652 there was absolutely nothing that conflicted with his strategic image as an average working joe
9029653 he related this salt of the earth persona back to the people of pa
9029654 we have the nbc comedy the office now well have the office of the vice president
9029655 right now theyre just included with the high volume of criminal cases that come through the court these cases need special attention
9029656 they just languish in jail until they come to court and hearings are continued and they continue to languish
9029657 if the alleged criminal conduct is a direct result of their mental illness then they can be put in this court
9029658 the democrats have demonstrated theyre taking back the white house
9029659 they did a great job of getting out the message of unity and change and that we cant keep going the way the last four years have been
9029660 iowans will carry this energy back home and were going to elect barack obama president
9029661 he is a patriot and is ready to make this country work for families that work hard and play by the rules
9029662 i think if someone watched that speech and wasnt moved theyre a lost cause
9029663 ive been more aware this year than any other year
9029664 i know hope is used a lot but i feel hopeful
9029665 the thing is to continue to make tennessee an environment that is business friendly
9029666 to keep taxes low and keep unfunded mandates down that environment recruited volkswagen to chattanooga
9029667 to do that we need to make sure that cities and counties are working outside of their municipal silos and city and county limits and are thinking regionally
9029668 when we take a look at people who are uninsured or under insured they go to emergency rooms
9029669 that drives up the cost of the state providing care and to hospitals
9029670 i have that background from my past work as an in house attorney and strategic business unit manager with bellsouth and i am strongly committed to working with gov bredesen and with fellow tennesseans to get us moving forward
9029671 the point that is being missed by those opposed to pre k is that it helps get children on track so that they are able to read at grade level by the fourth grade
9029672 by now most tennessee students are not reading at grade level
9029673 someone with 150 000 salary shouldnt be able to put child in state funded pre k rather than daycare
9029674 lets face it whether were talking about health care illegal immigration or sex offenders were looking at how it affects the family
9029675 i hope to have the opportunity to support families working people public servants retired and returning veterans
9029676 they say theyre sorry theyre not allowed to schedule an appointment for any of beckys patients until they hire someone new
9029677 there is a stagnating number of primary care providers in the county since at least 2006
9029678 thats despite a growth in population and a generally aging population which requires more health care services
9029679 people call here all the time i dont have much good news for them
9029680 its not just here in olympia its the whole system doctors in medical school choose to be specialists instead of primary care so they dont have to work 70 hours a week and see a lot of patients in order to get reimbursed
9029681 in thurston county the olympia sea mar community health center is the primary source of care for low income families the elderly and disabled
9029682 however even at maximum provider staffing sea mar has inadequate primary care capacity to service the low income uninsured and medicaid populations
9029683 we want to make sure we hire the correct person with the specific skill set and experience to provide good patient care
9029684 the provider shortage is really having an impact here theres a national shortage of arnps
9029685 im worried not only about me but also about all the other patients
9029686 we are complying with all state and federal laws and the related provisions regarding confidentiality
9029687 it seems more practical if the clinic that has all my records would just examine me
9029688 as a district were assuming the responsibility for this loss
9029689 although we think there was poor judgment used by the employee in leaving the laptop in the car
9029690 we recognize that the security of state data is a systemwide responsibility
9029691 my friend michelle called me the next morning and asked me how do i get
9029692 when gas was 4 14 a gallon this body was debating the monkey safety act you are sitting in the peoples house and this congress needs to be considering your priorities
9029693 how much is solar and wind power they say its 1 percent but really they rounded it up its really 5 percent
9029694 something happened with gas hit 4 a gallon if we had a vote today on a bill that says yes to more american energy production and also yes to solar and wind and conservation and efficiency it would pass with 250 votes
9029695 we have a bill the american energy act and it does four thing it maximizes development of american energy it calls for commonsense conservation it calls for free market innovation and it a responsibly transitions us to americas energy future we need to avoid a situation a situation where we deny americans the ability to develop our own resources

9029757 and with both oil and gasoline inventories much lower than when katrina and rita hit the price consequences could be even worse this time any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 1 75 per litre
9029758 whether gustav ultimately lives up to its hurricane billings and sidelines production like rita and katrina remains to be seen but its very presence in the rig dotted region underscores the vulnerability of u s domestic crude supply to climate change

9029774 relocating the burn and wound centers helps us showcase two of the most important service lines we offer
9029775 what this also does is shine a light once again on the important steps our physicians and associates make throughout the entire hospital to deliver advanced care to patients and their families
9029776 the burn center has saved countless lives and is a tremendous benefit for this area
9029777 it holds a special place in my heart because if it werent for this unit i wouldnt be here plain and simple these people are like a second family to me

9029800 the wii is a well made device that has found a new target group for a while we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game but perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot although its a different strategy it pays off we currently have a production bottleneck with the playstation 3
9029801 the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us
9029802 the reason why im so convinced is that ive always been saying our software developers eat up storage space so much quicker than telcos can build distribution
9029803 i mean we used to be below 1gb but were now building games that have 8 9 10gb and if broadband distribution is going to allow 10gb to be distributed in half an hour well have games that are 100gb because the graphical resolution increases

9029860 the running mate who can best help me shake up washington
9029861 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
9029862 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
9029863 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
9029864 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
9029865 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
9029866 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
9029867 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
9029868 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
9029869 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9029870 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
9029871 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
9029872 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
9029873 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
9029874 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
9029875 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
9029876 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
9029877 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
9029878 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
9029879 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
9029880 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
9029881 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
9029882 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
9029883 he knows how to twist with the best of them
9029884 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
9029885 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
9029886 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
9029887 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
9029888 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
9029889 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
9029890 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
9029891 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
9029892 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
9029893 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
9029894 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
9029895 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9029896 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
9029897 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
9029898 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
9029899 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
9029900 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
9029901 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
9029902 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
9029903 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
9029904 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
9029905 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
9029906 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
9029907 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
9029908 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
9029909 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
9029910 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had

9029969 according to sciencedaily nasa has come to the conclusion that the planet mercury may have molten hot magma at its core the rest is nasty tasting processed junk and the after taste of mcnuggets ech i think you just figured out what the secret ingredient is score 5 funny by anonymous coward buy the new mercury bar with a molten caramel core i suppose the longer mercury can hold out as an active planet the longer will should last as one assuming we make it that far i do not know much about this but is it possible mercury would always have a molten core just do the extremes it endures gravity mercury is not tidally locked with the sun but rotates very slowly at about 3 rotations for every 2 revolutions around the sun they used to think it was locked nature com before they found the 3 2 resonance since the resonance is stable rotational energy is not being affected anymore but then that means tidal forces are still heating mercury over a 1400 hour cycle the heat loss from friction is probably coming out of the orbital energy making the orbit unstable and even more an ocean does not act as any sort of a buffer against gravitational forces from the sun theres just not a significant enough amount of water even on earth to do so ok so the water transmits zero torque until theres how much of it then ok so the water transmits zero torque until theres how much of it then i would imagine its proximity to the sun plays a part in it hot objects in cooler areas cool off faster than hot objects in warmer areas after all its true that mercury is considerably smaller than mars but its proximity to the sun and all of its heat is considerably closer than mars is after all the surface temperature of mercury is what 400 some degrees when facing the sun what is magma but liquid rock what is water but liquid ice youre reading it wrong it is mercury has quite a strong field compared to mars or venus heres a short blurb which mentions that mercury probably has a molten core written in 2003 a landing mission with the ability to do chemical analysis would answer a lot of questions the problem is the high energy cost but i think this is the idea opportunity to try a solar sail for the cruise stage and mercury orbit insertion so mercury may have molten magma in the middle but manages only a mostly marginal magnetic field magnificent you may or may not remember the mariner 10 probe making 3 passes by mercury between march 29th 1974 september 21st 1974 and march 16 1975

9029976 useful first step toward keeping muslim charities from being shut down
9029977 fundamental change requires a change in the governments basic approach to interpreting the law
9029978 in order to preserve the rights of all nonprofit organisations and indeed the rights of all people all levels of government must conduct their counterterrorism activities in a way that consistently protects liberty and civil society otherwise americans and others lose safeguards that were designed to protect us all from creeping tyranny
