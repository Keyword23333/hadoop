2590035 m s de cuatro a os de su vida gastaron mar a y eduardo en un noviazgo aparentemente feliz que se acab cuando terminaron la carrera que estudiaron juntos fue como si hubieran agotado los temas de conversaci n que ten an en la universidad para entrar en una competencia profesional que lejos de dar trascendencia a su relaci n marcaba territorios incompatibles finalmente eduardo confes que cuando se dio cuenta de que su noviazgo le reclamaba mas formalidad tuvo miedo de continuar porque necesitaba tiempo para saber si mar a era la mujer con quien realmente deseaba pasar el resto de su vida su caso es el de cada vez m s parejas modernas que huyen de la responsabilidad como del demonio incluso cuando ya tienen todo preparado para la boda quiz s no supieron nunca que el verdadero amor no se traduce en sentir bonito cuando se est frente a la pareja y que tampoco significa estar de acuerdo en todo lo que se hace porque cuando realmente se ama a alguien se adquiere el compromiso moral de ayudarlo respetuosamente a ser mejor a que crezca como ser humano en todos los aspectos cuando los j venes sue an con encontrar al pr ncipe azul o a la s per mujer para ser felices siempre tendr n que plantearse con toda seriedad si no est n esquizofr nicos porque un mundo as solo se da en las letras o en las telenovelas donde navegamos a merced de la imaginaci n del autor pero no en el mundo donde el creador ha dispuesto para los hombres la felicidad y el sufrimiento los logros y los fracasos la aceptaci n y el rechazo y la lucha constante y permanente desde que nacemos hasta que dejamos de respirar hace poco llego a mis manos una informaci n de cimac en la que martha celia herrera psicoterapeuta del centro de interdisciplina conductuales asegura que las mujeres aun hoy conservan la expectativa de encontrar a un hombre maduro productivo estable rico inteligente paternal que cambie pa ales que las acompa e al pediatra que sepa preparar papillas que sea una excelente pareja tierno que externe sus emociones que no pida relaciones intimas cuando ella est enojada que sea emp tico ellos entre tanto buscan a la mujer de sus sue os productiva inteligente excelente anfitriona que desee uno o dos hijos cuando l lo decida que no pida dinero que sea autosuficiente independiente y aut noma que colabore en la econom a familiar y que cuide a los ni os que lave planche cocine y tenga bien arreglada la casa adem s de que se d tiempo para cuidar su apariencia que siempre est s per delgada que sea vea sexy etc etc la doctora herrera dice que con la revoluci n sexual y el feminismo se rompi el equilibrio tradicional entre el papel que correspond a a los hombres y el que estaba destinado a las mujeres los varones se asustan frente a las mujeres que compiten con ellos en su espacio laboral y que a menudo est n m s calificadas que ellos y esa amenaza a veces se extiende al campo sentimental influye tambi n que se dividieron los roles pero nunca quedaron delineados ahora la mujer tiene m s actividades que antes porque debe estudiar trabajar y atender a su familia hecho que resulta desconcertante para todos las expectativas femeninas y las masculinas son irreales y poco objetivas muchos ni siquiera son capaces de expresar lo que esperan del otro yo no soy psicoterapeuta pero se que en la vida nada es m gico ni gratuito los hombres y las mujeres hemos sido siempre los mismos aunque las circunstancias han cambiado y en este rengl n no tan positivamente como seria deseable hoy queremos que todo sea f cil y desechable pero eso no es posible en las personas nadie est ya hecho la vida entera no nos alcanza a veces para irnos moldeando seg n nuestras metas y proyectos de la misma manera dos seres inacabados que tendr an que estar conscientes de que van a esculpirse juntos durante toda la vida anhelar un pr ncipe azul o una s per mujer junto a nosotros no es un pecado pero si puede llegar a convertirse en un obst culo para ser felices al lado de un ser humano de carne y hueso con potencialidades y miserias que como nosotros necesita comprensi n y verdadero amor para perfeccionarse poco a poco si hoy tantas relaciones se rompen despu s de un tiempo de tratarse en su noviazgo es precisamente porque no estamos dispuestos a trabajar para forjar una relaci n sana sincera basada en el verdadero amor que no es solo romanticismo sino prueba constante de fidelidad comunicaci n respeto y de humanidad curiosamente la doctora herrera concluye que mientras estudian licenciaturas maestr as y doctorados hombres y mujeres no se dan tiempo para habilitarse en pareja para hablar de si mismos todo eso se queda guardado y cuando cumplen 30 a os o m s deciden tener un compa ero suponen que como por arte de magia contar n con habilidades que no desarrollaron porque nunca se dieron tiempo para hacerlo para relacionarse con otra persona hay que estar dispuesto a negociar a manejar enojos a discutir no pelear porque aunque existan puntos de vista diferentes es posible conseguir objetivos que satisfagan a los dos dice la doctora pero eso cuesta quiz s el problema radica en que nadie desea comprometerse a entablar la lucha por lograrlo demasiado ego smo dir a yo cada d a son m s las mujeres y hombres profesionistas independientes inteligentes y de exito que ven pasar los a os sin encontrar pareja personas de todas las clases sociales se encuentran frente al mismo problema son solteros y solteras se han quedado atrapados as en un espacio dentro de la sociedad actual muy limitado en cuanto a diversiones y actividades y se les dificulta mucho encontrar personas en su misma situaci n ya no se diga para casarse sino simplemente para acompa arse y entablar una buena amistad ya no existe la palabra solter n a y su imagen ha cambiado 180 grados ya no es el hombre o la mujer gris amargada vestido como fraile o monja seg n sea el caso ahora son seres impecables atractivos as de muy buen car cter que van supliendo la juventud con personalidad y desarrollo humano e intelectual que hay demasiadas mujeres y pocos hombres es una idea que se escucha todos los d as y que ha llegado a penetrar profundo en la conciencia de las mujeres de todos los estratos sociales este punto se da como un hecho apoyado en estad sticas generalmente falsas o bastante caprichosas a un n mero determinado de mujeres les corresponde un n mero equivalente de hombres a diferencia de la idea com n de que por cada hombre hay cinco o seis mujeres pero la soledad no es exclusiva de aquellas personas que son solteras hay mujeres que aun estando rodeadas de mucha gente llegan a sentirse muy solas y a sufrir de carencias afectivas tambi n entre mujeres y hombres casadas os que comparten su vida con su pareja es frecuente encontrar solas acompa adas para poder amar verdaderamente hay que renunciar a creer que ese sentimiento es el fin de la soledad y estar dispuestos a aceptar dos soledades la del otro y la propia y es que amor es confesar si yo te amo como tu eres aunque no correspondas a mis sue os y a mis esperanzas tu realidad me da mucho m s regocijo que mis sue os

2590041 en chile nos enteramos d a a d a incluso a trav s de los medios de comunicaci n como j venes heterosexuales menores de 18 a os mantienen relaci n sexuales con personas mayores de edad sin que nadie se sorprenda o lo repruebe porque la ley lo permite toda vez que la edad de consentimiento sexual est fijada en los 14 a os en cambio cuando se trata de homosexuales estos j venes y sus parejas son tratados como delincuentes porque discriminatoriamente para ellos la edad de consentimiento es de 18 a os
2590042 esto es inhumano les estamos diciendo a j venes homosexuales que amar y desear a alguien de su mismo sexo es un delito lo cual afecta claramente su desarrollo arm nico y provoca serios trastornos en la estabilidad ps quica que muchas veces termina en el suicidio
2590043 ahora lo que queremos es que se iguale la edad de consentimiento sexual entre heterosexuales y homosexuales es justo y necesario pues en caso contrario se sigue cristalizando una injusta hip crita y arbitraria aplicaci n de la ley

2590132 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2590133 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
2590134 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2590135 at the end i realized i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
2590136 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was
2590137 i wont come back unless im in shape and i feel like im in decent shape you cant show up to this race if youre not in shape so it just depends on how i train id love to be back
2590138 i dont know what happened its got to be flattened by now it was squishing all over
2590139 that was a product of lance and i being together
2590140 it was lances idea i would have never considered that
2590141 i executed jumps ive been working for the winter season and they looked really good
2590142 im doing them a lot more consistently and im really building my confidence jumping on the ramps in the summer helps us keep sharp and allows us to work on the small details
2590143 i did two brand new jumps ive never done and it went really well there was probably 10 guys that tried a new trick and i was one of five guys who did a quintuple twisting jump usually there may be one or two that attempt that jump

2590146 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2590147 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2590148 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2590149 thats our approach going into it well defer just about every time unless there is some overriding circumstance that would cause us to do it differently so well start doing that now
2590150 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2590151 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2590152 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2590153 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market
2590154 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2590155 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2590156 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2590157 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees

2590172 pero me cont que l lo jug que es algo muy lindo y que tambi n por eso entend a mi postura de querer quedarme ac
2590173 siempre dije lo que quer a cuando sali esto del tas tambi n estaba tranquilo porque el club sab a lo que yo pretend a y el club se port muy bien conmigo y me dej quedarme la verdad es que no tuve ning n problema porque ya hab a hablado con el club
2590174 hoy por hoy es el mejor delantero del mundo y no creo que haya otro como l y tenerlo en nuestro equipo es algo importante
2590175 qued claro que nunca le dimos importancia ni l ni yo a todo eso que se dice eso es algo que armaron ustedes
2590176 hablamos de c mo estaba el grupo del equipo de lo que comentaban tambi n de que est bamos peleados y de que no era cierto todo muy normal como dos compa eros
2590177 nunca nos confiamos y sabemos que cada partido va a ser dificil smo
2590178 sabemos que hay que demostrar todo dentro de la cancha
2590179 la verdad es que se va a hacer m s dif cil jugar cuando ellos est n encerrados atr s
2590180 va a ser mucho m s dif cil contra l
2590181 siempre es lindo ganar una final y m s a brasil
2590182 sigue siendo un rival duro con un poder o f sico importante
2590183 muy luchado con muchas situaciones pero pudimos convertir y a partir de ah avanzamos con mucha m s soltura
2590184 pero sabemos que sigue siendo un rival duro con un poder o f sico importante y que tenemos que tener cuidado m s que nada con eso porque nosotros apostamos m s a jugar al f tbol que a lo f sico
2590185 cada uno tiene que tratar de vivir su propia experiencia
2590186 ahora lo principal es tratar de clasificar y despu s se van a ir definiendo solos los candidatos creo que tenemos que tener la inteligencia para clasificar
2590187 ma ana si es posible mucho mejor y despu s sabemos que hay algunos equipos que se perfilan pero en el futbol puede pasar cualquier cosa
2590188 no es un grupo que escuche especialmente a los mayores sino que todo el mundo trata de aportar su punto de vista porque hay jugadores que tienen 20 21 22 a os pero tienen mucha experiencia
2590189 es pr cticamente el abanderado del equipo el capit n y sabe que esta es la nica oportunidad que va a tener de jugar en los jo y ganar una cosa m s con la selecci n
2590190 debemos pensar en pasar la previa aunque el schalke es un gran equipo
2590191 afrontamos con muchas ganas el partido ante el schalke porque nos jugamos el a o pasado en esta eliminatoria
2590192 debemos pensar en pasar la previa aunque el schalke es un gran equipo
2590193 ser a un duro golpe para ellos que marc semos en su campo los goles fuera de casa son importantes hay que estar muy concentrados los 180 minutos y ojal se resuelva all pero no creo
2590194 sabemos que el atl tico de madrid siempre tiene problemas defensivos venga quien venga por vuestra parte los medios de comunicaci n si se falla no siempre hay que achacar la culpa a la defensa o al portero
2590195 todos los a os el atl tico se refuerza en esa parte y estoy con las mismas ganas e ilusi n que todas las temporadas
2590196 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
2590197 were starting to understand that we do have a responsibility as citizens not just to let somebody else take care of us but take care of ourselves
2590198 its been exciting to see more and more of them step out from behind the mini blinds and go wait a minute we have to do something
2590199 itll be great fun when we reach number one but i want 180 000 people getting it
2590200 we dont leave stuff in our car we mark our stuff we watch out for our neighborhoods
2590201 last year we were able to hold a roster spot open for gary as he attempted to make a monumental comeback
2590202 after he underwent a knee scope last week we are unfortunately not in a position to hold a roster spot this year we are releasing gary today in hopes he will be able to continue his rehab and get back into the nfl either with another team or possibly the browns gary has made tremendous strides thus far and we believe he can play professional football again in the future
2590203 nossa prioridade n o disputar o t tulo precisamos sim reestruturar as nossas categorias de base para formarmos um time competitivo para daqui a tr s quatro anos temos que parar de montar equipes de aluguel

2590213 sends a message to all of the countries in the former soviet space that russia is resurgent and is willing to flex it muscles
2590214 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2590215 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2590216 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict they mark a dangerous escalation of the conflict
2590217 has been far disproportionate from whatever threat russia was citing
2590218 to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2590219 there are already russian aircraft over georgia so the chances of direct engagement between russian and nato aircraft is very high
2590220 if you are in moscow and you are looking at the tools that the u s nato and the eu have what are they
2590221 nobody is going to send troops so you are going to get away with it
2590222 get off the phone and onto a plane and make it completely clear to moscow that our relationship depends on what they do from here on out

2590251 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2590252 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2590253 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2590254 cangurus s o adaptados ao ambiente australiano se forem criados em quantidade suficiente seria muito sensato fazer mais uso deles do que j fazemos hoje
2590255 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2590256 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2590257 for years i kept bright in my mind like scenes from a film what they would have been without that war
2590258 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2590259 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2590260 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2590261 it is possible that we move lower tuesday morning but a big short cover rally should be expected by noon

2590264 mr bachman and his wife barbara were visiting the drum tower in beijing china when they were attacked shortly after noon by an assailant wielding a knife
2590265 their daughter elisabeth was with them at the time of the attack
2590266 mr bachman died as a result of injuries sustained in the attack mrs bachman suffered serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital for emergency treatment her injuries are serious and life threatening
2590267 most of the players called their parents i told them to be strong
2590268 the president has been informed and his heart goes out to the families of the victims
2590269 the white house and us embassy have offered whatever assistance the family needs us officials have also been in touch with chinese authorities on the matter
2590270 most of the players called their parents i told them to be strong
2590271 president saakashvili decided that the georgian olympic delegation would remain in beijing
2590272 we are going to continue the competition with more passion and determination
2590273 we are going to play with more passion against all countries including russia
2590274 i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2590275 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2590276 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure
2590277 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2590278 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries i saw the first few heats go out and i kind of wanted to be the top seed for tomorrow that is all i went out to do
2590279 i instructed undersecretary esteban conejos jr and the philippine embassy in turkey to be prepared for the evacuation of our filipino workers should the situation worsen
2590280 i have signed a decree on a state of war
2590281 georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2590282 i have already forgiven the man who wronged me and i have prayed for him
2590283 this means that we are on track in capturing or neutralizing all the terrorists
2590284 mike defensor a former cabinet secretary brought the new investors to the country everyone including his detractors are invited to do the same
2590285 theres no limit to our need for more investors which will eventually contribute more jobs in our country
2590286 for as long as all the government requirements and laws are followed
2590287 this set back the peace process but we can revisit the moa itself we should not give up on peace
2590288 they said its about the peace process it doesnt mean its gone the process will continue and the end of this is the way to the plebiscite when stakeholders will express their own individual decision and the ambassadors are watching the developments
2590289 the government is disabusing the view that because of the setback the peace process is dead everyone knows the moa is the most important element of the package and the end is the final compact this is a long process and nothing will be violated
2590290 first of all in order to move the tro has to be lifted we cant move forward if its not lifted the question is not the merits of moa but the procedure were hoping this will be resolved and the sc will allow the signing to go back to the formal talks
2590291 this is the most telling sovereign right given to the entity among many others granted to it
2590292 the department of foreign affairs should have put its foot down against this assault on the sovereign prerogative of the philippines to represent the country in the un
2590293 this default i hope it is only a default gives rise to perception that the philippines is a weak republic and that philippine diplomacy is either timid or asleep or both
2590294 this is testimony that our programs are being appreciated by the public
2590295 theres so much to do especially in education which is very close to the hearts of the public education really concerns everyone therefore everybody is focused on our efforts
2590296 the president recognizes that investing in our human resource who will comprise the future workforce will bring about higher economic returns
2590297 filipinos think that government agencies that deliver social services and administer the education and health sector are performing better than other government institutions
2590298 im glad to hear that we are slowly moving up that means we have to double up on our pro people legislations
2590299 my rating is immaterial my concern is the house of the people as an institution my job is to lead and perform and not to be popular
2590300 fix the house and make it work for the national and public interest
2590301 instead of just designing for the rich the top architects of the country are designing for the least and really restoring it and elevating the dignity of the least among us
2590302 in the past the gk villages were designed constructed conceptualized by gk members ika nga ni tony a lot of this were done bara bara hit and miss a lot of this were done tantya tantya lahat thats basically how the concept of villages came up and what has resulted are some very very nice villages even without the help of architects
2590303 now what tony meloto wants to do is to bring the design of the village up to the next level by inviting professionals in the field of architecture and design who can lend their name and expertise to the design of the villages
2590304 the concept here is a gk village but the consultants are branded just like all these projects that you see they announce the names of the consultants because there is recognition and it helps in selling the project
2590305 it will be up to the students to work and design on the 20 sqm floor area architects are used to the 100 sqm model unit even for interior designers but now the students are given 20 square meters to play with so thats the big challenge for all the students they will be in charge of the exterior of the building and the interior decoration as well
2590306 when i was invited by tony meloto to help spearhead this project i was a little bit afraid at the beginning because i really dont know how to approach this challenge when the dust settled i realized that it is important to make this dream come true because housing is not only for the rich but for the poor and we are doing this for the nation
2590307 aside from housing we also included the challenge of landscaping so its not just the house but how the environment around these houses will be able to enhance the lifestyle of the occupants
2590308 if you look at taguig you will see high end and high rise buildings in fort bonifacio and poor squatters on c5 we want to create a socialized housing system and this is possible because the private sector is helping us and if we show them that if they help the poor their money will not be wasted then they will help us more in our efforts
2590309 this is what palafox calls anti snob zone for example you have a high rise building here for the rich and then maybe separated only by a park or a lake there is also a building for the poor in that way the rich will get to see the poor and they will feel the need to look out and help their less fortunate brothers and sisters
2590310 let me thank you and congratulate you for bringing the worlds most memorable olympics
2590311 it is an honor to be able to witness first hand the memorable and wonderful preparations from the spectacular facilities and the exciting games that are connected with the events
2590312 thus it should not be a reason for us to lower our guard against prospective election cheats
2590313 let us restore credibility to our electoral process with the aid of the most advanced technology but let us keep in mind that theres no better safeguard against cheating but sustained public vigilance
2590314 our holding of automated elections in the armm will more quickly build a foundation for peace and cut deeper inroads for development which is a core issue of conflict in the southern philippines
2590315 to check the veracity of these claims of disenfranchisement to identify the cause and extent of the problem address the same and prosecute those responsible if any
2590316 every election there is a deluge of complaints of alleged registered voters who are not able to vote for various reasons while some claims could be meritorious some could also be a ploy designed to discredit the election process
2590317 in order to verify the report the complaining person shall be interviewed to obtain the information needed by using the specified format for said purpose
2590318 what we are praying for is for this automated elections to be a big success being the first step to the modernization of the countrys electoral system
2590319 im confirming that the rebels have not pulled out and that they even harassed another village of mixed muslims and christians at the border of aleosan and pikit
2590320 some of them are now at churches public school campuses and at a public gymnasium in pikit
2590321 we are fixing that now i am very hopeful and confident this will be settled soonest
2590322 because these people are armed and the civilians might panic if there is a sudden repositioning
2590323 but we have spoken to the milf and they have assured us they will pull out
2590324 we are giving way to a peaceful resolution of this conflict through negotiation and dialogue
2590325 there were sporadic firing noted in some of the affected areas but they are not direct confrontation between our troops and the milf
2590326 none of this would have happened if malaca ang had followed through on my lead in rebuilding any and all attempts to cut up the republic of the philippines and in restoring philippine sovereignty in areas and camps previously claimed to be the exclusive domain of the milf
2590327 but it was a necessary step in preventing further chaos in mindanao and pushing through with a genuine peace and development initiative in the region
2590328 the irony is that in a number of markets led by detroit up 4 8 and cleveland up 2 7 we are hearing that the long slide may be over and the balance has tipped back to the upside we need a catalyst a swift and sudden addition to the housing mix it may well be that the new housing law will serve that purpose it is so new that most borrowers and lenders are not yet aware of what is in it i believe there is a good possibility that with prices now down the added protections and federal assistance in the law will clear fear from the air and start the comeback process more next week adrian van eck

2590351 overall i ran a little harder today and i hit a little more today as well
2590352 i didnt have any problems and i felt pretty good afterwards too its another step forward
2590353 theres no doubt about it i feel confident now if i keep progressing
2590354 no one cares about us at all lets call it what it is its good all the attention has went the other way cause we really dont like it so you know brett favre going to the jets it can be pretty positive for us all you guys are going to pay attention to them now
2590355 he got a broadway sign and hes on the paper every day so now they have to deal with it i think he is going to realize the media is a little different than in green bay he cant control it
2590356 we have our quarterback here hes not planning on retiring or doing anything silly for the next couple of years so i think we are all right were worrying about the giants
2590357 hes almost the michael jordan of the nfl right now
2590358 he is leaving the one team that he has always known and now he is starting a new chapter in his life i am sure he is excited
2590359 really to be honest with you people dont care about you as a person they just want to know what have you done for me lately with brett favre he has done very well for the packers i just dont think that him leaving the packers was a great thing because you never know with them the jets

2590362 that will take time and its tough but so far its been great
2590363 its the first time ive put on the pads since the giants game
2590364 well cater the program and the learning and hes been working incredibly hard he quarterbacks coach brian daboll and offensive co ordinator brian schottenheimer have already spent a lot of time together well take it in chunks
2590365 theres been a lot of ups and downs not only the last couple weeks but the last couple months i think everyone was ready to get on with football
2590366 that goes without saying but they were the same in green bay i like the guys here i like the coaches i like erics approach its an easy going approach
2590367 this is the tough part for me its only going to get tougher because im behind

2590399 i know that the folks here in hawaii are especially hard hit because everything has to come into hawaii and gas prices have gone up the roof fuel prices have gone through the roof and its time that you got some real relief and that means actually starting to have an energy policy in this country that makes sense
2590400 weve been divided for so long weve been arguing for so long a lot of times about things that arent even worth arguing about and ignoring the things that we should be doing to make the next generation have a better life
2590401 but they also deserve a civilian leadership that understands that the most important thing we can do to make ourselves safe is to fight the right wars to finish the job in afghanistan and start bringing this war in iraq to a close start bringing our troops out and when they come home to treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve no more homeless vets no more begging for disability payments

2590410 it is now time for the states to give up the powers that theyve had and taken advantage of over the past 50 odd years and give the powers to the commonwealth to ensure that we can have a truly independent body making the decisions in the best interest of the river
2590411 when states can be given as they have the right of veto to any of the proposals or plans put forward by the current authority its a furphy to say that it is independent

2590413 were in a black hole at the moment as far as research goes but it is hard to imagine a world in the future where these technologies are not deployed more widely
2590414 we need to get the evidence to see if these things can be deployed on a wide scale
2590415 the extreme environmentalists are preventing us from collecting the evidence we have to go public and try to move the public debate forward we know what the consequences will be but we need that debate
2590416 we have major concerns we have no idea what the interaction with wild trees could be there could be unforeseen consequences
2590417 there is a growing global movement for a complete moratorium on gm trees because of their ecological impact these trees could cross pollinate with wild trees over great distances if traits are passed on to native trees it can have a significant negative impact on biodiversity
2590418 gm trees are a very bad idea for a lot of reasons if these trees are released into the environment then contamination is inevitable we do not support any trials because there is no guarantee against escapes of the genetically modified traits
2590419 the real tragedy of the attacks on the field trials were that they actually prevented us accumulating the knowledge of just how useful they could be i cant see any justification for interfering with field trials
2590420 the whole area has had such a bad press that it would be a real bonus to find an example where they could show a conservation benefit to make people stop and think again that it could be beneficial rather than the entrenched positions almost knee jerk responses that some of the conservation groups have come out with
2590421 in other parts of the world people really are pursuing it much more actively than we are at the moment if these trees do offer benefits we will be left behind
2590422 we are always open minded and if there were a potentially significant gm breakthrough which for example would allow a reduction in pesticide use or would tackle a challenge thrown up by climate change such as from new pests and diseases then we would consider it within the context of sustainable forest management with partners in the environmental sector and in government

2590493 in iraq the assumption was that it would be a liberation not an occupation youve got to be prepared for the worst case and the worst case involving iran takes you down to boots on the ground
2590494 look any war with a country that is as big as iran that has a terrorist capability along its borders that has a missile capability that is external to its own borders and that has the ability to affect the worlds oil markets is something that everyone needs to contemplate with a great degree of clarity

2590522 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2590523 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did
2590524 bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2590525 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in
2590526 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2590527 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2590528 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities
2590529 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2590530 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2590531 there was an incident involving angie everhart and her boyfriend

2590559 who am i to say that im right and theyre wrong
2590560 despite the fervent and far reaching opposition to his plans mr guite has persisted in his quest the court finds it difficult to fathom his persistence in the face of such widespread and heartfelt opposition its hard to imagine introducing yourself to a community with an action that the community finds abhorrent
2590561 perhaps it is time for the vermont legislature to consider protecting the sanctity of old cemeteries because of the strong community sentiment expressed so eloquently by so many vermonters who continue to have that strong sense of community faith and tradition

2590674 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2590675 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2590676 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2590677 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2590678 we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time
2590679 tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest americans who dont need them and didnt even ask for them
2590680 the american people are worse off than they were eight years ago
2590681 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2590682 one al qaeda in iraq terrorist died when he detonated a vehicle borne bomb
2590683 all the georgian guys will be leaving for the homeland
2590684 ever since the end of last summer we have seen blow away numbers on the job creation side so does two months make a trend
2590685 keep in mind that when economies slow down a little bit a lot of people actually enroll in universities and do self enriching things so that theyre better prepared to compete in a job market
2590686 the only significant job gains were in accommodation and food services where 22 000 people were hired across the country
2590687 the job losses happened in quebec ontario saskatchewan and prince edward island quebec lost 30 000 jobs and the provincial jobless rate rose to 7 4 per cent ontario lost 19 000 jobs although its unemployment rate actually dropped to 6 4 per cent from 6 7 per cent when about 42 000 people left the job market
2590688 thats because many people especially younger part time workers left the workforce

2590695 theres enough unhappiness with the current model that even if we were to take a pretty small percentage away we would be doing pretty well
2590696 ebay is the gazillion pound gorilla and even as they acknowledge the model needs a bit of tweaking for them to make a change is pretty difficult
2590697 chuck schwab made the comment that if you build a great trading platform you could even sell baskets on it and we took that to heart
2590698 just how you want to know what your stocks are worth you can know what your stuff is worth

2590706 yahoo understands the trust of our users is our greatest asset so we strive to create the most trusted compelling online experience
2590707 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them
2590708 however we understand that there are some users who prefer not to receive customized advertising and this opt out will offer them even greater choice

2590730 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2590731 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2590732 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear
2590733 i believe he can recommend charges or action be taken against the police as a whole as well as individual officers if its felt necessary
2590734 the early stages of the investigation led by detectives in portimao really were very poor
2590735 a number of people had touched the window and entered madeleines and the twins room prior to the arrival of the gnr local police
2590736 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2590737 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2590738 during many moments of his professional career he had to make decisions in a fraction of a second which gives him a coldness
2590739 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2590740 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2590741 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2590742 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2590743 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2590744 reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
2590745 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2590746 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2590747 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries

2590749 giving gays the right to marry is giving them extra rights
2590750 well right now its not like you cant get married you can go marry a guy anyone can marry someone of the opposite sex it doesnt matter what your sexual orientation is if we let you marry someone of the same sex wed be giving you extra rights
2590751 if we legalized marriage between two people of the same sex you could go out and marry a guy too it doesnt matter what your sexual orientation is also i think you might be gay

2590753 to cause high prices all the federal reserve board will do will be to lower the rediscount rate producing an expansion of credit and a rising stock market then when business men are adjusted to these conditions it can check prosperity in mid career by arbitrarily raising the rate of interest it can cause the pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth by slight changes in the discount rate or cause violent fluctuations by a greater rate variation and in either case it will possess inside information as to financial conditions and advance knowledge of the coming change either up or down this is the strangest most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any government that ever existed the system is private conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other peoples money they know in advance when to create panics to their advantage they also know when to stop panic inflation and deflation work equally well for them when they control finance

2590776 local and regional volleyball news stories from around the world womens volleyball debbie green vargas special recognition awards volleyball voices stories prep players volleyball voices stories national team players
2590777 let me tell you a secret something they dont teach you in your temple the gods envy us they envy us because were mortal because any moment may be our last everything is more beautiful because were doomed you will never be more lovely than you are now we will never be here again
2590778 hate is not the opposite of love love is passion and so the opposite would be anything but passionate it would be apathy hate is passion and almost as readily as we strive to love we strive to hate more hate drives us it pushes us and it feeds our egos without hate no civilization no man no creature would have advanced this far
2590779 love is a sickness a passionate sickness that tears both sexes asunder and places them nestled in between insanity and foolishness love makes you toss and turn breathe and eat differently love makes you hate stronger and feel a greater sense of jealously but it is love that comes and goes love is the common cold without immunity and without a cure
2590780 words in essence are only as strong as the speaker and to remind myself of this i write the words i quit on each and everyone of my cigarettes
2590781 i am weak because i chose to be weak i chose to let myself become as frail as glass and as easily swayed as sand i chose to be afraid and try and escape but here i stand now in my weakness i am far stronger than anyone else because i chose and nobody else dares to choose
2590782 to be loved or feared is a question machiavelli answered too soon for as a ruler men will swiftly betray a leader whether he be feared or loved but as men we are guilty with the curse of emotion and men will sooner feel a greater remorse for betraying those he loves then one he fears in the question is it better to be loved of feared id far rather be loved
2590783 lovers beds are warm things with welcoming smiles but a spouses bed is a chilling war zone of things i cannot describe in this sentiment id sooner choose the path of taking lovers to comfort my nights for i am much a coward to face the uncanny things a spouse brings
2590784 fighting with words is useless people have done so for many years i have yet to see a conflict resolved that way words may broadcast messages but it is a bold show of hands spirits emotions and raw animalism that makes men remember that they are not men but beasts and to everyone who knows it all beasts are created equal
2590785 god what of it i acknowledge that it might exist but what it does or chooses to do is not my concern i dont want to know anything about it how many in number it is what sex is it i dont question i just wonder what that serene bastard been doing with infinite time i couldnt possibly imagine it would be fun
2590786 god is dead i killed him and i ate him in essence i have become a god
2590787 cannibalism is a necessary evil mens flesh contains larger amounts of things needed to live then a common animals if i were trapped on an island with someone and i had no food id pity the idea of eating them and regret it but alas i would much rather satiate myself and keep my survival instinct happy then be the food of the other person
2590788 stereotypes are useless but no matter how many times its said were going to do it anyway all hail the age of typing
2590789 computers are like life push a button and you can end it all
2590790 sex is a trivial matter because i engage in it and enjoy it but i detest it and would sooner be without it then most sex is enjoyable for its duration and brilliant physical exercise but when all is said and done hearts break and people hate themselves except in the case of couples who after sex wake up and think only about the flaws of them and their other
2590791 life is only enjoyable because our time if finite and will eventually end we want to enjoy it because we may not wake up tomorrow and i like other pity those who cannot enjoy it i pity them however because they may be around tomorrow to have a far worse day then todays

2590834 the party and its presumptive nominee barack obama are rethinking how they talk about the issue
2590835 as a party we have to remember we are the big tent and have to make room for people with diverse views on this issue
2590836 were hopeful that some language will be included that will say pro life democrats welcome but at the end of the day were still democrats and were gonna work hard to work on things that we strongly believe in
2590837 but at the end of the day were still democrats

2590850 a minister who promotes the old testament roots of christianity suggests a rare string of lunar and solar eclipses said to fall on gods annual holy days seven years from now could herald whats come to be known as the
2590851 the reason we need to be watching is because he will signal his appearance but we have to know what to be watching as well so we need to be watching the biblical holidays
2590852 it means a signal kind of like one if by land two if by sea its like god wants to signal us
2590853 the hebrew word implies not only is it a signal but its a signal for coming or his appearing
2590854 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and the terrible day of the lord come
2590855 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
2590856 when we think of the sun being darkened and the moon not giving her light we usually think of some astronomical catastrophe perhaps the sun sputtering and the moon being affected by all this but maybe its time to rethink this a little bit and think of it as a natural cycle the cycle of the eclipses
2590857 the fact that it doesnt happen again in this century i think is very significant
2590858 so then i looked at last century and believe it or not the last time that four blood red moons occurred together was in 1967 and 1968 tied to jerusalem recaptured by israel
2590859 whats significant to me is that even before 1967 the next time that you had four blood red moons again was right after israel became a nation in 48 it happened again in 1949 and 1950 on passover and succoth you didnt have any astronomical tetrads in the 1800s the 1700s the 1600s in the 1500s there were six but none of those fell on passover and succoth
2590860 you have the religious year beginning with the total solar eclipse two weeks later a total lunar eclipse on passover and then the civil year beginning with the solar eclipse followed two weeks later by another total blood red moon on the feast of succoth all in 2015
2590861 if you think that this is a coincidence i want you to know that its time
2590862 there are no more of these for the rest of the century
2590863 ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh
2590864 when he says you dont know the day or the hour hes speaking to the foolish virgins not the wise virgins
2590865 but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only
2590866 because it was based on the sighting of the new moon
2590867 when he jesus says you wont know the day or the hour hes telling you its the feast of trumpets because that was known as the feast where no one knew the day or the hour that it would begin
2590868 so its kind of like if i told you im not going to tell you when im coming but
2590869 we dont know that that will be the concluding year of the tribulation period so were not setting a date and saying this is a warning were introducing the possibility of a watch
2590870 the feast of trumpets or rosh hashanah is the day of the blowing of the ancient jewish trumpet the
2590871 the event that the bible says will take place is basically a peace treaty that will be made with israel and its enemies around it

2590875 re s o of evangelical prays for rain on obama i think the differences come down to benefits and the ability to have ones marriage

2590877 re re s o of evangelical prays for rain on obama i think you are thinking of the different ceremonies legal or religious

2590892 it would be a sensible move to make room for the penguins on the other hand we cant keep stepping back
2590893 in doing a not so serious thing fantasy wrestling that we take seriously weve been able to establish ourselves as a serious brand and weve worked hard to establish that brand with our tremendous audience and support from that audience this is the next logical step giving back to the legends that have supported us during our development and who continue to support us as we continue to grow

2590902 the hearts of the sons of adam contain treasures and the keys to the hearts are in the hand of our lord
2590903 mevlana it is easy enough for me to understand how someone who dies a slow death from a long and torturous disease may have time to reflect on his life and realizing his helplessness believe and turn to allah in repentance taubah even though he was the most stubborn unbeliever and evildoer up until that time but what i cant comprehend is how someone who is for example shot and killed while in the act of committing a heinous crime may attain repentance despite the suddenness of his death
2590904 and we dont send our verses ayat except to frighten takhweefeh
2590905 if you dont stop doing that i will kill you
2590906 for me these are the greatest good tidings as it gives me hope of my safety from hell to know that allah almightys mercy will come and cover everything on the last day
2590907 oh my lord i never thought that you would really put me in the fire of hell
2590908 why should we make a great effort to please allah if there is a good chance that he will forgive us anyway
2590909 mevlana in the light of these good tidings from the secrets of the holy quran namely that allahs mercy encompasses all that the mere assumption of allahs mercy is sufficient for attaining it and that neither body nor soul will shoulder the blame for bad actions and will thus escape punishment in the light of these teachings the element of fear seems to be negated so many of us came to islam because of the fear of hell that we feel when we read about it in the holy quran wont this news of allahs all embracing mercy eliminate the fear of hell as a deterrent of bad actions
2590910 who is your lord what is your religion who is your prophet and what is the book that he brought

2590912 i seek refuge in allah from you who are you
2590913 dont you recognize me you were with me all your life and you were very proud of me i accompanied you to so many bars casinos and houses of ill repute and now you will not know me i am your bad actions i carried you all your life and now you must carry me i shall be with you until judgement day
2590914 i am the worst and my ego is the dirtiest were it not for allahs mercy i would surely be destined for hell my only hope is his forgiveness
2590915 to him who knows no mercy no mercy will be shown
2590916 oh my lord you have power over all things and you have absolute power to do anything you wish to do therefore i am asking you now to make my body so big as to fill the seven hells so that no place remains for other people every punishment you would give to your people pour it on me instead
2590917 oh my servant are you trying to compete with me in generosity and mercy whereas i am the most merciful of the merciful arham ur rahimeen the most generous of the generous akram ul akrameen all your generosity and mercy is only like a drop in an endless ocean compared to my mercy and generosity that i am giving out to my servants every minute and i demand of you no blood sacrifice

2590937 while some nuclear proponents maintain the world actually has 2 500 years worth of nuclear material
2590938 if we are willing to distill the whole sea because seawater contains uranium at the level of three parts per billion but i doubt anybody will be making the economic decision to process uranium from seawater
2590939 the only solution for keeping nuclear plants in commission is to reprocess spent fuel goswami said in order to extend the nuclear power industrys lifespan but reprocessing is illegal today in the u s

2590945 society is obsessed with the idea of talent and genius and people who are naturals with innate ability
2590946 people who believe in the power of talent tend not to fulfill their potential because theyre so concerned with looking smart and not making mistakes but people who believe that talent can be developed are the ones who really push stretch confront their own mistakes and learn from them

2590961 we have a fantastic relationship with police arms officers they are aware of how stringent we are

2590963 linking to census data also allowed us to include a relatively large number of cases
2590964 the finding that tb rates are associated with crowded living conditions fits with what we know about the transmission of this bacteria via small airborne droplets

2590971 the midday attack sent shock waves through the games precinct after the olympics spectacular opening ceremony had set an ebullient tone president george w bush in the chinese capital for the games expressed sadness while american athletes and olympics officials reacted with disbelief
2590972 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2590973 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2590974 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people

2591001 hes also going to take a look as part of next years budget at what we could do immediately from a facility point of view as we house people with mental illnesses in the jail
2591002 we are speaking to the conditions and for them to investigate it
2591003 regardless of who the contractor is if their policies and practices are in clear violation of peoples basic human rights thats our bottom line concern
2591004 the funding is gone and were just working on getting that re established
2591005 because omh felt that these programs were unable to substantiate effectiveness
2591006 i dont see how we can with close to 80 percent of the budget mandated by the state right now
2591007 even if it isnt directly to them itll impact them one way or another
2591008 our concern is that this should be a priority area in new york because of the impact of fort drum
2591009 we would certainly benefit from continuity of state funding programs that benefit not only north country residents but also the many soldier families that routinely use those programs and services
2591010 with those deficits that means the county has to pick it up and the county is not very flush with money
2591011 right now we are scrambling to provide the services the county could pick up the cost or terminate the program
2591012 we are looking at programs that are not mandated by the state that we do and its possible we may discontinue ones that arent mandated
2591013 its hard to swallow but we dont have much choice if albany comes down on us weve got to do something about it
2591014 by spreading cuts out the community services board hoped to have the least amount of impact possible
2591015 inflating tires can save as much oil as we can produce by drilling

2591017 inflating tires can save as much oil as we can produce by drilling
2591018 part of their successful defense was how can you condemn me for an act youre alleging was illegal when you hand me a document with the state seal and signature on it sanctioning me to go forward and continue the same act with that it became obvious that the law was broke it needed to be fixed
2591019 in some ways its not an issue because it hasnt been raised

2591021 the deal was that suzanne stay in the military for her remaining 19 months no reduction in rank a summary court martial no assurance she would not be redeployed and here is the kicker suzanne would sign a statement saying she was not raped in iraq
2591022 over the two year period of time in which congress has been requiring this mandated reporting to the armed services committees its about a 60 percent increase
2591023 and our offices have received over 500 reports of sexual assault in the central command area of responsibility iraq afghanistan kuwait and bahrain
2591024 if you go into a court martial whether youre heterosexual or homosexual it doesnt matter your sexual history your relationship history even can come into view
2591025 the military continues to be behind the rest of our society in revising our sexual assault statute
2591026 once you report your career is at risk for taking a different path
2591027 its almost as if youre guilty until proven innocent because everyone is saying well before i take this as a real case the victim and the accused generally know each other
2591028 you dont want to ruin a good officers career do you
2591029 you dont want to ruin a good officers career do you
2591030 you dont want to ruin this guys career over this do you i mean come on you werent hurt or anything
2591031 we will not stop watching over our entire people and no one not even you will be able to take this responsibility from us
2591032 to rejoice over victory by violence is to rejoice over slaughter the wise ruler sees a military triumph as a funeral
2591033 if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them but the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart
2591034 there is a principle which is a bar against all information which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance that principle is contempt prior to investigation
2591035 men honor what lies within the sphere of their knowledge but do not realize how dependent they are on what lies beyond it
2591036 what a man desires to know is that i e the external world but his means of knowing is this i e himself how can he know that only by the perfection of this
2591037 to realise the relative validity of ones convictions and yet stand for them unflinchingly is what distinguishes a civilised man from a barbarian
2591038 this new binding resolution will prevent the government from renewing the u n mandate without the parliaments permission theyll need to come back to us by the end of the year and we will definitely refuse to extend the u n mandate without conditions
2591039 there will be no such a thing as a blank check for renewing the u n mandate anymore any renewal will be attached to a timetable for a complete withdrawal
2591040 the parliament today passed a binding resolution that will guarantee lawmakers an opportunity to block the extension of the un mandate under which coalition troops now remain in iraq when it comes up for renewal in december
2591041 some force of americans is present for a protracted period of time but in ways that are protective of the sovereignty of the host government
2591042 it is another example of the prime minister dismissing the views of the parliament and monopolizing all power
2591043 there is now an increasingly restless bloc of nationalists in the iraqi parliament opposed to the administration of iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki whose government is dominated by shiite sunni and kurdish separatists
2591044 by separatists we mean groups who oppose a unified iraq with a strong central government key figures like maliki of the dawa party shia leader abdul aziz al hakeem of the supreme council for the islamic revolution in iraq
2591045 war in this world can be stopped not by the ruling establishment but by those who suffer from war they will do the most natural thing stop obeying orders
2591046 theyll the iraqis think they can get away with managing their oil for their own benefit instead of signing it over for a song to international corporations that pull bushs strings
2591047 if the people of iraq could end this war it would be over already
2591048 look the iraquis asked us to help and as long as they want us to stay were staying
2591049 i called my congressperson today ask me how you can call
2591050 i can assure you that we all want to end this as soon as possible so we can get on with the task of allowing the iraqi people to form a new government
2591051 we will leave iraq completely in the hands of iraqis as quickly as possible
2591052 we are there at the invitation of the iraqi government this is a sovereign nation twelve million people went to the polls to approve a constitution its their governments choice if they were to say leave we would leave

2591065 america is not yet on the verge of fascism but democracy is again in danger
2591066 facism should more properly be called corporatetism because it is the total merging of corporate and state power

2591102 we have unrealistic expectations for people john edwards like the rest of us is only human
2591103 the truth is a lot of ordinary average americans have affairs
2591104 the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2591105 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2591106 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention
2591107 i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2591108 there are people who feel let down when you invest that much time and energy in a candidate and the candidate turns out to be less than you thought

2591165 i agree with the majority that macasaet failed to substantiate his story however i disagree with the majoritys conclusion that this suffices to hold macasaet guilty of contempt of court
2591166 i respectfully reiterate my dissent in the in re emil jurado case i vote to dismiss the contempt charge
2591167 macasaet was reduced to a passive participant unable to subject the testimonies of adverse witnesses to rigorous probing under cross examination as matters stand macasaet will be subjected to punitive sanctions based on evidence he had no opportunity to scrutinize
2591168 before a journalist can be punished in a criminal contempt case as in this case there must be proof beyond reasonable doubt that his publication tends to obstruct administration of justice and the degree of imminence of the obstruction actually happening extremely high
2591169 fails to meet the applicable standard in contempt by publication proceedings
2591170 we must scrutinize macasaets publications through the lens of the clear and present danger test guided by these queries 1 is the evil consequence of macasaets publications extremely serious and 2 is the degree of its imminence extremely high the facts of this case do not meet either criterion
2591171 falsity and negligence test asks the questions 1 whether macasaets story was false and 2 whether macasaet could have prevented the publication of the false story by exercising diligence in verifying its veracity
2591172 failure to substantiate a story or even the mere falsity of publications had long ceased to suffice to hold journalists in contempt of court unless there is a clear and present danger that such false reports will impair the administration of justice
2591173 under the falsity and negligence test any kind of unflattering publication to a judge or court whether or not putting at risk a fair trial or decision become punishable for contempt if false and the journalist could have prevented the publication by exercising diligence to verify its veracity good faith is not a defense
2591174 is a sharp dagger aimed at the heart of free speech and of free press the falsity and negligence test compels the journalist to guarantee the veracity of what he writes on pain of criminal contempt of court obviously this has a chilling effect on free speech and free press
2591175 the undue weight give to the falsity alone of respondents columns in unsettling for after finding respondents columns as false the majority did not go any further to determine whether these falsehoods constitute a clear and present danger to the administration of justice
2591176 macasaet and newsbreak based their reports on the alleged bribery from information obtained from their respective confidential sources in short it was professional call on the part of macasaet and newsbreak to run the story this court should be the last to attribute negative motives for this judgment call
2591177 as the highest court of the land the court should be the first to resist the temptation to privilege its members with the shield of lese majeste through the liberal falsity and negligence test this court diminishes itself if it diminishes the free press guarantee for an independent judiciary needs a free press as much as a free press needs an independent judiciary

2591187 one way or another these laws need to be approved
2591188 these books are utter rot disgraceful trashy works of total fiction
2591189 to our neighbors my wife nancy and i dont appear in the least unusual to those in the quiet oregon community where we live we are viewed just as we are a happy couple deeply in love our desire to work hard buy our first home and start a family was nothing out of the ordinary that is until we decided that i would carry our child
2591190 shrieks with delight at the sight of the tortoiseshell cat
2591191 the only people who have gotten upset are a handful of straight identified homophobic ftms female to male transgender people online who started calling matt by his girl name because real men dont get pregnant
2591192 thats like saying you cant be a woman and have a career
2591193 the irony is weve had a debate in feminism about the idea that if men were able to have children we would be in a very different position and yet when it happens there is enormous fear
2591194 as a trans man myself i wouldnt ever dream of getting pregnant but i think thomas beatie identifies himself as male as much as i do and he just wants to reproduce
2591195 when my brother found out about my loss he said its a good thing that happened
2591196 doctors have discriminated against us turning us away due to their religious beliefs health care professionals have refused to call me by a male pronoun or recognize nancy as my wife
2591197 receptionists have laughed at us friends and family have been unsupportive most of nancys family doesnt even know im transgender
2591198 you imagine a poor kid getting born into that family going hey whoa
2591199 put your quarters in the machine and well let you wash your car

2591209 i heard about the open position with rehabcare through email and a mailing i received an email first from jan but originally i heard of rehabcare through my clinical
2591210 the main reason for my job switch was the fact that i was driving 60 minutes to work and rehabcare had a facility within 20 minutes from my house plus i liked the fact that they seem to be flexible other therapist seemed to be laid back compensation for mileage and my hourly compensation they also have nice benefits for vacation and ceus
2591211 my recruiting experience was good jan was sure to follow up with me after my interview and talk over the position as well as my concerns
2591212 i would recommend this site to another student because you get the opportunity to interact with families physicians nurses and other clinicians
2591213 the staff is very helpful they maintain an upbeat environment continue taking students its a great experience

2591217 this trip just gave me a whole different perspective i learned so much not only just about physical therapy but just about people and how i learn how others learn how to work in a team
2591218 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery

2591228 mr roberts ross is an excellent person and an outstanding member in his community ive known him for quite some time and its a pleasure to represent him
2591229 you are not looking for that active voter who maybe knows who he or she is voting for
2591230 you are looking for that more passive voter who is reading information but not quite ready to commit
2591231 search can be the most important brand tool in a marketers arsenal if its used in the right place its a matter of understanding what search can do and what it cant and even more importantly understanding how to measure that value
2591232 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2591233 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2591234 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2591235 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2591236 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2591237 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2591238 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2591239 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2591240 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2591241 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2591242 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2591243 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2591244 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2591245 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2591246 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2591247 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2591248 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2591249 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2591250 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2591251 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2591252 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2591305 fans had heard he was going to watch former doctor who star catherine so they turned up in force complete with props
2591306 he was very charming and friendly with them during the interval but he was rightly disgusted when they disrupted her performance by singing the shows music and waving their sonic screwdrivers
2591307 catherine is a pro so she ignored them but david knew the only way to stop them was by getting up and leaving
2591308 in the early summer dr aldhizer began to notice that his name had been signed on chart entries notes and prescriptions of patients in mcnamaras office

2591328 at a time when scores of companies are freezing pensions for their workers some are quietly converting those pension plans into resources to finance their executives retirement benefits and pay in recent years companies from intel corporation to centurytel inc collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank and file pension plans this lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives supplemental benefits and compensation

2591389 i actually talked to charles howell today about whether to have it set up really really easy or really really hard
2591390 theres a little something inside me that says either one could work
2591391 its really interesting when you look at the board and you look at the history of the u s open and you look at the history of the pga championship it seems like the more difficult it is the better off the more the americans show up
2591392 i think when youve got a bunch of guys coming in and playing well you want to give them a chance to play golf
2591393 and so its kind of a catch 22 whats better really really hard and hope for the best or you set it up maybe a little easier and say you know what my guys are playing well im going to let them play golf
2591394 here youre not really playing golf as much as youre kind of just hanging in there
2591395 you cant play golf here from the rough this week you chop it out and then you play from the fairway after youve chopped it out
2591396 i think the most exciting shot in golf is a recovery shot and theres not a lot of recovery shot hope here
2591397 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2591398 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2591399 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2591400 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2591401 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2591402 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2591403 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2591404 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2591405 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2591406 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2591407 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2591408 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2591409 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2591410 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2591411 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2591412 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2591413 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2591414 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2591415 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2591416 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2591417 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2591418 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2591419 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2591420 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2591421 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2591422 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2591423 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2591424 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2591425 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2591426 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2591427 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2591428 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2591429 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2591430 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2591431 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2591432 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2591433 who are open to doing something on the production side
2591434 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2591435 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2591436 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2591437 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2591438 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2591439 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2591440 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2591441 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2591442 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2591443 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2591444 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2591445 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2591446 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2591447 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2591448 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2591449 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2591450 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2591451 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2591452 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2591453 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2591454 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2591455 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2591456 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2591457 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2591458 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2591459 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2591460 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2591461 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2591462 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2591463 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2591464 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2591465 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2591466 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2591467 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2591468 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2591469 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

2591472 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2591473 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2591474 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2591475 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2591476 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2591477 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2591478 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2591479 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2591480 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2591481 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2591508 we support each other all the way through we have one goal and thats to win the gold medal so we are going to be behind each other the whole way
2591509 this is their home country and they want to leave out of the olympics with a medal we dont want that to happen it will be a great challenge for us
2591510 and when you look at their fans theyre going to have home court advantage so to speak we have to be on top of our game

2591523 i know the air looks bad but i dont know if it is as bad as it looks
2591524 i didnt feel it maybe tonight i will be coughing a little but thats normal
2591525 i was looking at a newspaper picture of the horses in hong kong site of the olympic equestrian events with swamp coolers in front of them
2591526 but this definitely was among my top 10 hardest races
2591527 i got goose bumps in heat and thats probably not a good thing
2591528 i have ridden in conditions like that tons of times but never for so long it was so humid that going up hills you just couldnt breathe and the sweat wouldnt come off you
2591529 it feels like you have hot cream all over your body once you go full gas you cannot breathe

2591532 if its accurate its probably just because its a college party town with ut and all and then theres sixth street
2591533 its important for people to understand that ut students make up 5 percent of austins population when they are all here
2591534 we work with freshmen at orientation to talk about how students can avoid dangers of alcohol abuse how to recognize alcohol poisoning

2591536 he passed away this morning fromfrom complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital no other details are available at this time we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2591537 ive been here 19 years and this agency has been in existence since 1696 the office of the sheriff of prince georges county has never been under a civil rights review or no one has ever called for the department of justice to come in
2591538 there is no reason there has been no reason and as long as im here there will not be a reason for it
2591539 we have unrealistic expectations for people john edwards like the rest of us is only human
2591540 the truth is a lot of ordinary average americans have affairs
2591541 the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2591542 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2591543 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention
2591544 i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2591545 there are people who feel let down when you invest that much time and energy in a candidate and the candidate turns out to be less than you thought
2591546 the american public has become sensitised to this type of behaviour from political leaders
2591547 lamentablemente mi conclusi n es que va a ser muy dif cil si no imposible encontrar puntos de coincidencia suficientes para elaborar una declaraci n conjunta

2591555 says hes a democrat i dont know what his concept of democracy is but to me this is not democracy
2591556 president hugo chavez did not create the disqualifications against the opposition
2591557 one way or another these laws need to be approved
2591558 weve had some good performances and were competitive if things go right after the first couple of games then maybe well change our goals
2591559 we didnt qualify for athens in 2004 and weve missed out on a couple of world championships this is what you put your life on hold for
2591560 i want these games to be the peak of my career
2591561 it has been a seven year struggle to get to these games
2591562 just to let the canadians know what we have done in ice hockey terms pretend we are italy or israel playing ice hockey and trying to qualify for the olympic games
2591563 we go to a tournament and beat czech republic or finland to qualify we are going to the olympics they are not now we are at the big games and the press is asking us can you win a medal
2591564 do you think italy or israel have a chance to beat canada russia or sweden to win a medal at the winter olympics they have already won a medal just getting there we are ranked 15th in the world and we beat argentina who are ranked sixth in the world we have reached a podium that most of the other canadian athletes can only aspire to but we will do our very best to do even more in beijing
2591565 but you just have to treat it like a tournament

2591589 its 87degrees outside you just pulled a christmas hat over my head stuffed the room with fluffy animals and placed dictionaries on the couch what the hell is going on
2591590 well i first thought it was a dream but from the fact im lying on the ground you really are pregnant arent you
2591591 alex what are you talking about of course im happy
2591592 i dont know i guess b because it wasnt planned
2591593 any way you look at it this is not a good result
2591594 its disappointing and its not the outcome that wed ever seek but it is one thats manageable
2591595 born country my life in alabama how faith family and music brought me home
2591596 its not some musical ashram more of a revolving door of musicians
2591597 i kind of think of it like casting a movie
2591598 but they can have deep theological undertones it can be a love song between a man or a woman or a love song between man and whatever the divine is
2591599 i wrote it a few years ago when i was at a naval station in jacksonville fla
2591600 it was 1 a m and i saw a frigate which is a big ship that had an american flag on it
2591601 i think people are on board and want to be patriotic
2591602 in a time of politics when differences are being highlighted i think this is something we can agree upon
2591603 i auditioned for american idol with 103 000 people god is guiding my steps i believe im here for a reason
2591604 neil thrasher knows how to use words in a creative and original way which is something all of us performers want
2591605 the song he wrote looking like love is the hardest song i ever sang in my life it starts off real low for me then goes into my highest vocal range neil has that range
2591606 in atlanta i could mess up and do what i needed to grow up
2591607 everyone has growing pains and falling on their faces i could do that without the whole world documenting and judging me
2591608 and when i go to restaurants and ask for cheese in my grits
2591609 i remember going there maybe to a shoe store and as soon as you cross the state line its like getting a big hug
2591610 it smells so good and is so beautiful i miss the hospitality of the people and i miss my family
2591611 when i was around 13 or 14 i used to think another interview i cant take it
2591612 i had to figure out how to say the same thing different ways but ive learned to have fun and be glad that people are interested even when i dont feel like doing it it comes with the territory have an interesting life so you have something to talk about and enjoy the craft
2591613 we want to be the best rock band in the world its just really funky when business and art collide we kind of have to adapt to that
2591614 i told the band were sitting down with one of those 5 000 piece puzzles you find in the basement
2591615 were hoping it all fits together to make a pretty picture id say weve got the edges of it right now its the way i always think about building a band so the highs arent too high and the lows arent too low
2591616 its not like shes going to present me with a cappuccino or something
2591617 we just want to be able to make the music that we love together
2591618 were not brothers but i think were almost as close
2591619 he opened us to the door of people we were really blessed to meet him and have him love us for who we are
2591620 they came to austin and i went and saw them perform live
2591621 that was the thing that convinced me the most cool songs cool instrumentation and i thought the singer was really amazing
2591622 capture where they were at get good takes and work on good arrangements of the songs
2591623 by the time we went to record those songs with mike wed been playing them for so long and adding things
2591624 on my parts they were a jumbled mess he stripped it down and brought it back to where they were in the beginning
2591625 i kept saying it was like when you were a kid and you were really really excited to meet mickey mouse it was also 40 degrees in there which is a letterman thing but we got to rehearse the song a lot and that was comforting it was kind of hard to enjoy it i kept thinking about my first girlfriend from high school and wondering if she was watching
2591626 its relieving to think of it that way now we want to enjoy the slow burn and the rest of the journey
2591627 id rather be the guy who gets the feel out and has the vibe
2591628 i consider myself more obsessed with the song than the guitar
2591629 wow so this is birmingham how cool who wouldve known

2591635 what lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us
2591636 the world is a dangerous place not because of the people who are evil but because of the people who dont do any thing about it
2591637 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing
2591638 we did not know until after the game so that was pretty cool
2591639 we started off probably a c but we ended up probably a b
2591640 we support each other all the way through we have one goal and thats to win the gold medal so we are going to be behind each other the whole way
2591641 this is their home country and they want to leave out of the olympics with a medal we dont want that to happen it will be a great challenge for us

2591645 its supposed to be a sober living place but theyre always at the liquor store buying beer theyre running their motorcycles all night long they own three or four houses up and down the street
2591646 they have helped my parents on numerous occasions and pastor phil welcomed me with open arms into his church his home and his family

2591648 this took place in the early morning and went very smoothly
2591649 phil always wanted to be somebody in the outlaw biker world and hes been hiding behind the cross for a long time
2591650 when he began recruiting members he figured the badder they were the better
2591651 it puts all of us christian bikers in a negative light that all of a sudden were gangs too
2591652 were not all thugs and dont have gang behavior we have to go out and do gods work
2591653 what i saw today is far far far from how i know them
2591654 i cant believe they are being portrayed as thugs i think maybe some of them who havent corrected their ways got rowdy but their behavior is totally contrary to how they acted in front of me
2591655 he doesnt ask you about your history or what youve done bad he just accepts you with open arms
2591656 i dont believe he would do anything unless he was protecting himself because hes turned around
2591657 they feel theyre reaching a kind of person the larger religious community cant reach
2591658 a lot of people on the margins of society may have been helped but they are not always aware of the tentacles that an organization like this can have on their lives

2591688 the surface of the earth is beset by creatures in a constant state of war with one another millions perish on either side and there is no limit to the brutality of their malice their nations fall and rise only to fall and rise again the vast forests have been laid low by them and the pastures defiled with their poison their gluttony is matched only by their appetites for death affliction terror and banishment of every living thing and despite their iniquities they aspire to rise to the firmament but mark this the excessive weight of their very sins will weigh them down

2591693 after coronation street i always worried that i would be type cast as the fresh faced nice guy so im pleased to be taking on a different role
2591694 the connection with the audience is so immediate and its amazing to get that instant reaction
2591695 musical theatre is a great way for me to further my career and im really pleased to be doing this tour
2591696 at the time i wasnt doing anything else and i lived just down the road from the studios so it was great to go back and see everyone after being away for around three years

2591700 i really would love to go into film and my next challenge is to go for lots of tv and film auditions and hope someone gives me a chance
2591701 when you are in a soap you are always in the public eye and its actually good to be away from it as you just become known as that nice young boy from coronation street
2591702 i did love my time on the show but i hope i may be able to take on a more manly role in the future
2591703 at the end of the day it depends on what im working on but i never say never
2591704 we had been working on this project for two years the device will be made available to government run schools shortly
2591705 these esbs can be modified as per the class in which the children are enrolled for instance a student enrolled in class iii wont have to carry books and guides to schools as all such study material can be stored in the esb similarly esb for other children enrolled in higher classes can be modified as per their study material
2591706 we are also approaching district and state education officials to take forward the concept of hi tech education in government schools

2591713 the problem we ran into was jurisdiction including questions about crown land navigable waters etc we have all that sorted out
2591714 some of them have been freeloading for a very long time some of them have had a pretty good thing going by not having to pay moorage fees weve delivered the notices so the owners cant say they didnt know in the next few weeks well be removing the vessels out of our water lot
2591715 staff have tried to find some commercial space where the boats can be impounded but real estate is pretty expensive in kelowna so we may have to move them to one of our facilities including the landfill because we have space there
2591716 a combination of inattention and a fair bit of denial that causes people to believe their home is insulated from the woes of the market that affect others but not them
2591717 although many homeowners may believe the worst is over we think this level of optimism is out of sync with actual market performance
2591718 our feet are probably our most accurate indicators of how we feel about things
2591719 it meant so much to our family that our fellow kelowna residents came out to support connor and canadian blood services
2591720 my son would not be where he is today if not for the blood donated by generous canadians and for that we are truly grateful
2591721 the support we received from the community throughout this blood drive was fantastic
2591722 this years dka mardi gras promises to be another successful event for us there are three stages of live entertainment throughout the day a huge kids zone street performers sidewalk sales and much more we have been working hard since last fall to make this an excellent day for families and our businesses alike
2591723 there is legislation that mandates that boaters have certain equipment on board to navigate in the dark that will have to be looked into to determine if there was any fault
2591724 there were flames coming from all parts of the house it was deemed at that time that it was unsafe to go inside so we fought it from the outside
2591725 there were two people here when we arrived a father and son the father suffered some minor burns i think they were trying to find their pets but we understand that all three dogs got out of the house
2591726 we did receive one unconfirmed report that they saw flames on the back porch so that might suggest that maybe a barbecue
2591727 we did find something in the garage and the rcmp are looking after that
2591728 the problem we ran into was jurisdiction including questions about crown land navigable waters etc we have all that sorted out

2591731 im very happy to be informed its the first gold for china it added different meaning to the medal
2591732 what i thought was to make every good attempt and achieve as much as i can
2591733 i had low expectations of myself but my coach and teammates created ideal conditions for me to win
2591734 it is a great feeling to score my second goal of the tournament
2591735 although we made some small mistakes we did a great job in general we are competing at the right time and right place with support from the people of our country
2591736 there was no one home at the time of the warrant execution and investigators will being continuing to work to identify person s responsible at this time there has been no arrests and no charges laid
2591737 when the officers located it a man was attempting to attach a plate to the vehicle the man turned towards an officer in an aggressive manner then got back on the truck and took off
2591738 they made some inquires and then brought in the police dog the dog started tracking over several yards and fences before coming to a residence in the 5100 block of 27 avenue
2591739 it turns out the man had been arrested for mischief earlier in the year and was under probation he was under curfew and was supposed to be in from 9 at night until 6 in the morning he was to keep the peace and be of good behaviour he was arrested and taken back to jail
2591740 we urge the georgian authorities to immediately stop their aggression against south ossetia to stop all violations of all standing agreements on a ceasefire and to respect the legal rights and interests of other people
2591741 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2591742 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2591743 its really the military component that is at the forefront now not so much the diplomatic effort
2591744 master cpl roberts was moved by armoured vehicle to the closest combat outpost and was immediately evacuated by helicopter to the role 3 multi national medical facility at kandahar airfield
2591745 the nature of his injuries were such that in spite of their efforts his life could not be saved
2591746 his best friend describes him as a no nonsense kind of guy who lived like people dreamed he was a fun loving and genuine individual who was totally dedicated to the army and held his section together
2591747 we are deeply affected by this loss josh will be greatly missed by his military family
2591748 until we have conclusive results of the investigation i cant give you a definitive statement
2591749 it would be impossible to achieve what were achieving here
2591750 when youre up to your backside in alligators its tough to remember that your original job was to drain the swamp
2591751 another young man dead when will the gods desist from taking those we love theyre all so sorely missed
2591752 when i hear news that another child has passed from earth to a better land sorrows knife returns to twist more deeply too well the loss i understand
2591753 the adult female requested that the child go with her to her home to collect the surfboard the child refused to comply and the woman left in a car driven by a man
2591754 we know were going into other police jurisdictions but its a sign of the times
2591755 im bringing a fairly significant team were bringing out our motorcycle drill team which will be in this weekends parade in penticton on saturday well also have our ceremonial marching team a police dog and our 40 foot mobile recruiting office which is the first of its kind in canada after that were heading off to vernon where well be holding a recruitment presentation on monday at the prestige inn
2591756 last year we only had 300 applications were at a crossroads now in the past we would put an ad in the newspaper and we would get thousands of applications but that has changed with the economy at its highest and the unemployment rate at its lowest people have more choices
2591757 the ways of doing things in the past simply arent working were even using facebook and youtube which is a first for a major police department in canada
2591758 im afraid were on doorstep of a huge firestorm i think the government of canada needs to wake up to that fact and treat this as the emergency it truly represents
2591759 its a very dangerous situation its very critical and needs to be addressed on an emergency basis
2591760 last year we were able to hold a roster spot open for gary as he attempted to make a monumental comeback
2591761 after he underwent a knee scope last week we are unfortunately not in a position to hold a roster spot this year we are releasing gary today in hopes he will be able to continue his rehab and get back into the nfl either with another team or possibly the browns gary has made tremendous strides thus far and we believe he can play professional football again in the future

2591764 sometimes in the winds of change we find our true direction
2591765 to the world you might be one person but to that one person you might be the world
2591766 we really do live in a 24 7 society and it
2591767 sometimes we need to take a step back and refresh with an empty inbox or even a new inbox altogether to clear our mind and focus on those emails and relationships that are most important to us
2591768 otherwise people can feel as though you didn t care enough to write out their name to really get someone

2591796 bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2591797 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2591798 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2591799 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2591800 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2591801 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2591802 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2591803 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try

2591826 to live in and from the word of god in all our meetings assemblies and events so that as we regularly and increasingly hear read study share and are engaged by gods word we lead by example in faithful service and holy living
2591827 covenant together to begin a regular practice of bible study and prayer gathering with others in their congregation and or community to speak and hear the word from one another
2591828 in order to become more fluent in the first language of faith the language of scripture that we might live into our calling as a people renewed enlivened empowered and sent by the word
2591829 its really a matter of you taking the vision and deciding as a congregation how youre going to have scripture become more a part of the culture of your congregation
2591830 the enthusiasm for the book of faith initiative is palpable
2591831 there is a groundswell of interest in this initiative its an enormous opportunity that we have
2591832 this church accepts the canonical scriptures of the old and new testaments as the inspired word of god and the authoritative source and norm of its proclamation faith and life
2591833 my reply was that we in lutheran core coalition for reform are concerned for the interpretation of the bible as gods word of law and gospel and for the confessional integrity of the elca as a lutheran church body i added that what truly troubles us in lutheran core is the question whos in charge of the church is it private opinion and the relativistic mood of the times does the world set the agenda for the church or is it scripture and the confessions of our church

2592121 how unfortunate for edwards and his wife elizabeth but this doesnt have anything to do with the rest of us because john edwards isnt a public figure

2592141 from far beyond the galaxies ive journeyed to this place to study the behavior patterns of the human race and i find them highly illogical
2592142 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2592143 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2592144 people want to sell on anything or buy on anything
2592145 strengthening in the dollar is a good thing not only for business but also to build back confidence both domestically and internationally
2592146 a number of treatments have crept into fertility clinics over the years and are now part of our usual repertoire but as with many things in infertility most of these have not been properly evaluated
2592147 almost all couples with unexplained infertility will have one or both of these treatments but neither of them is significantly more effective than telling the couple to just go home and get on with it which is a lot cheaper and more fun
2592148 these treatments are offered by virtually every district hospital up and down the country so the total costs are tremendous particularly at a time when potentially more effective treatments such as ivf arent being funded because of lack of money in the system
2592149 this has to change clinical guidelines because none of these interventions are free
2592150 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
2592151 intrauterine insemination has been offered to couples with unexplained infertility for many years but if there is no benefit in doing so then we should re evaluate the clinical guidelines so that nhs money is used wisely

2592195 i basically left the working world altogether and stayed at home with my kids for five years
2592196 i came back in 2006 and was once again drawn to the internet sector luckily for me interest in enterprise 2 0 was just cropping up about the same time i re entered the workforce and i started blogging on the new sector
2592197 it was a tough transition having been out of the workforce and suddenly immersed in a new industry that i knew very little about social networking and the open collaborative nature of the the 2 0 web made it much easier for me to establish new relationships and get up to speed on the market
2592198 although i had known steve papermaster ceo ngenera from my tenure as an industry analyst and writer in the it services sector my blog gave me street cred with the other two ngenera founders and they offered me a job to help them launch their new startup
2592199 we have amazing clients and i thoroughly enjoy my work
2592200 part of the reason im interested in this sector is the societal changes the technology is fostering at the very root of social anything is people i believe all institutions are enriched when we tap the collective social conscience of a community whether resulting changes from these communities improve lives or balance sheets its all good we are headed irrevocably in the right direction

2592223 especially given the recent transformation of consoles from historically teen focused gaming devices to now becoming family entertainment hubs in many living rooms across the globe we are very focused on titles that satisfy this new broad demographic
2592224 we enjoyed working with gameshastra on tumblebugs 2 pc and are excited to collaborate again to bring our games to the emerging realm of console casual gaming the broad consumer appeal and high production values of wildfires titles make them a natural fit for the console space
2592225 after working closely with the wildfire team to create background art for tumblebugs 2 we realized the game was a fantastic wiiware candidate
2592226 the key to a successful wii port is the ability to expand the title to take advantage of the unique wiimote input system and we feel we have came up with a very innovative design that combines the regular shoot to match 3 experience with some very unique wii specific mechanics

2592241 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2592242 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2592243 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2592244 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2592245 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2592246 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2592247 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2592248 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2592249 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds

2592300 i love my cell phone but enough is enough i turn it off after 8pm
2592301 dont get me wrong im not a technophobe technology can be a wonderful thing we bears enjoy communicating as much as anyone but cell phone can be a bit much
2592302 if one bear finds honey it calls another bear if a bear is in need of protection its quite all right to use their cell phone in that case a cell phone is essential

2592316 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2592317 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others

2592350 it is now time for the states to give up the powers that theyve had and taken advantage of over the past 50 odd years and give the powers to the commonwealth to ensure that we can have a truly independent body making the decisions in the best interest of the river
2592351 when states can be given as they have the right of veto to any of the proposals or plans put forward by the current authority its a furphy to say that it is independent
2592352 a new coal station here would be a climate disaster it could emit more greenhouse gases than heathrow airport
2592353 most did not get far but two reached the power station and the crew of one also got over the perimeter fence
2592354 it was a total success we stopped any coal getting to the station and disrupted its operation if the government gives the go ahead for a new plant we will be back to stop it this is not a symbolic protest
2592355 this protest is about raising awareness hopefully it will put pressure on government not to approve new coal plants
2592356 this is a police warning please disperse in 10 minutes or police horses dogs and police batons will be used

2592358 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
2592359 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
2592360 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos

2592379 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2592380 a study 1975 1989 showed that portfolios that finished the first five years in the top quintile were actually the least likely to finish in the top half over the next five years
2592381 of the 50 top performing funds in 2000 not a single one appeard on the list in either 1999 or 1998
2592382 using past performance numbers as a method for choosing mutual funds is such a lousy idea that mutual fund companies are required by law to tell you it is a lousy idea
2592383 the enemy of a good plan is the search for a perfect plan

2592390 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2592391 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2592392 its a great honor that my teammates chose to vote for me the opening ceremony is the best day and the best moment of olympic life
2592393 im here as an ambassador of my country and i will do everything i can to represent my country well
2592394 this is another amazing step for me in celebrating being an american
2592395 there is no reason for outrage the man was a rapist
2592396 if we had the death penalty here there wouldnt be so many crimes
2592397 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
2592398 the reality is we will have a new president in three months and what bush and the republicans are trying to do amounts to a land grab for the oil companies
2592399 i dont think we have to give in at all pre election we have many more options postelection
2592400 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote
2592401 me llam la atenci n ver a un se or que parece que se quebrara impactado por la situaci n en la que se encuentra que despu s vierta expresiones algunas de ellas canallescas respecto de vargas aignasse descalific ndolo y con la lucidez que no condice con el estado que ha querido mostrarle a la sociedad

2592408 do you want me to come back there and do the transaction for you i could probably do all the crap parts of it that you dont like
2592409 consider three identical point particles approaching each other at 120 degree angles and colliding simultaneously that they bounce back along their approach trajectories is possible but it is equally possible for them to bounce in other directions again with 120 degree angles between their paths so long as momentum conservation is respected
2592410 in this case it seems to boil down to the question of whether there is some sort of a concept of a unified me
2592411 i have them thanks to my children and now i can consider me a fan of the two platforms wii and ds who can resist always loved the design rather reminds apple but nintendo has managed to insert quite well on their consoles we wanted a charismatic character and futuristic where everyone is able to identify the first thing that came to my head was even the wii

2592428 i was pleased and its always different when they put the pads on for the first time hoot n holler is a fun drill the crowd was nice and the weather was nice i think the crowd gave them a boost they made a little noise today so the players couldnt hear us coaches so im sure they liked that i thought they were wide eyed and bushy tailed today
2592429 the feeling that i will not be taken off this year feels so good and i am going to go give it my all every play
2592430 all of that stuff is in the past but it helped me mature in many ways i got a year in the weight room and i dont take anything for granted i am going to go 100 percent to the ball surround the ball and help my teammates in anyway i can
2592431 ive been on high school and prep teams but this team is super fast
2592432 exactly its like not feeding a pit bull for a couple of weeks you tease a steak in front of him then you let him off the chain what is he going to do to the meat
2592433 we need to pick it up on the offensive side a little bit some of those curry was not blocked but all three of those guys are going to be good players here im excited about them bullock to be so big 345 pounds he has a lot of sudden ness to him which i did not expect when i put on the film i went wow he is a very strong human being
2592434 weve really been pleased with the tempo we have had in camp so far the first two days in helmets the two days in shells and today they carried their pads real well i thought we ran well and they were enthused to be out here today
2592435 exactly and were training we are moving our juco guy and we are going to look at him at center too they need training and more training than anyone else up front

2592440 on behalf of the department of national defence and the canadian forces i would like to extend my most heartfelt sympathies to the family and friends of master corporal joshua brian roberts who died today while serving in afghanistan
2592441 there were times in practice today i wondered if i made the right move
2592442 there were supposed to be 2 numbers inside the box its a design flaw
2592443 why cant our local internet service provider companies provide such infrastructure
2592444 being in the it industry i am well aware that pldt globe and eastern telecoms are competent enough to provide such connection
2592445 today i cant believe it i cant believe im here
2592446 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2592447 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes
2592448 but somebodys going to enjoy it by the end of the week
2592449 says hes a democrat i dont know what his concept of democracy is but to me this is not democracy

2592458 i knew about jewelry because it was something that i had always been interested in

2592460 my mother died when i was 27 she only met two of her eight grandchildren id like to tell her about them and about her wonderful great grandson id tell her about my shop and how her love of jewelry has been passed on to me and to my daughters
2592461 we would urge people to keep visiting the beach and to check the most recent water quality results on the information boards or online
2592462 may have given rise to the operation of sewage overflows
2592463 none of our assets that could potentially impact on the bathing water at cruden bay was at fault
2592464 considering the 31 increase in the number of official bathing water sites this year at this halfway point results are better than at the same time last year
2592465 sepa has increased its programme to include the new official bathing waters and monitoring of scotlands bathing waters has increased by more than 20 overall this summer
2592466 overall these provisional results from sepa illustrate the water quality problems inherent in having very large numbers of combined sewer overflows and septic tanks lining the scottish coastline
2592467 there are also significant problems with bacteria contaminated storm pollution from farmland around the coast particularly in the south west
2592468 billions have been invested to date in cleaning up scottish coastal waters and this has had a remarkable transforming effect but these latest results show that we have yet to clearly beat the problem of periodic and unhealthy pollution at some of our bathing sites
2592469 it is pretty hard to understand how it can possibly have taken the government more than four years to work out where the danger areas are especially since the basic data is already available
2592470 thats four lost years which could have been used to set in place proper emergency plans and to begin to address the root causes of landslides in the most vulnerable areas the people of langholm will be infuriated by the governments lack of urgency on this issue
2592471 the risk is certainly likely to increase particularly in scotland
2592472 the low resolution map does not give enough detail to allow a viewer to make an assessment of hazard at a particular location
2592473 we have used this information as base data for our study but this alone would not allow us to predict where landslips are likely to occur with any accuracy
2592474 it requires very detailed assessment of specific locations coupled with sophisticated modelling of ground and climate conditions
2592475 the site is not suitable and investigations should be moved elsewhere
2592476 giant pandas are being exploited as diplomatic pawns in a commercial deal
2592477 putting such wonderful wild animals behind bars in edinburgh zoo would be wrong and this ludicrous and demeaning plan should be abandoned at once
2592478 in an unethical manner which reflects poorly on scotlands reputation
2592479 this is primarily a commercial transaction which the the zoo has also won enthusiastic support from buckingham palace
2592480 the ambassador will take your case forward when she judges the time to be right but she explained that recent events concerning tibet and the olympic torch relay have complicated the issue
2592481 pandas sell tickets they get people into zoos they make their captors money and lots of it
2592482 the uks approach seems stuck in the colonial era when animals were treated as no more than goods and chattels there to serve often obscure objectives of so called national interest
2592483 there is little direct conservation benefit to bringing pandas to edinburgh zoo
2592484 there is also no guarantee that the considerable fees the zoo will be paying will feed directly into panda conservation back in china
2592485 zoos have an important part to play in promoting the conservation of endangered species and educating the public
2592486 it plays a vital role in our ongoing negotiations to bring giant pandas to scotland
2592487 giant pandas will be beneficial to scotland and the uk in a number of ways but the societys primary concern is to participate in an international breeding and research programme to help secure the future of the species
2592488 companies that repeatedly fail these pollution assessments are a blot on scotlands green reputation and so harm our economy
2592489 and with fines equivalent to only a few minutes corporate earnings prosecution is no deterrent either sepa has the power to shut down repeat offenders by withdrawing their permits its time it took decisive action
2592490 we have made management changes and invested half a million pounds in improvements with the aim of winning a positive assessment from sepa for 2008
2592491 we are working closely with sepa on improvements to further reduce the likelihood of a similar event
2592492 this course of action represents the best practicable environmental option
2592493 we will be taking up these issues with our contacts in the company
2592494 sepa needs to crack down on the repeat offenders both to protect the environment and for the sake of its own credibility
2592495 it is precisely because sepa will not tolerate poor performance that a number of sites have failed repeatedly
2592496 it is important that we work with companies whose performance is less than satisfactory and identify how the management and operation of sites can be improved
2592497 however sepa will not shy away from taking appropriate enforcement action in relation to sites which consistently fail to meet sepas standards
2592498 in europe there is a greater propensity to consider something that is not from a traditional vendor

2592505 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2592506 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2592507 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2592508 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2592509 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2592510 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2592511 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2592512 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2592513 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2592514 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2592515 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2592516 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2592517 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2592518 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2592519 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2592520 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2592521 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2592522 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2592523 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2592524 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2592525 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2592526 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2592527 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2592528 georgia has a 2 000 strong contingent supporting the u s led coalition in iraq and washington provides training and equipment to the georgian military
2592529 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory

2592531 anarchy media player wp spam plugin best free stuff computerworld
2592532 we are making progress obviously a lot of meetings with a lot of people right now are happening
2592533 a lot of meetings with sponsors potential sponsors and sitting down internally with the organization as it sits now to figure out what we need to do to take the program to the next level
2592534 i feel good about the progress right now and in the short amount of time that weve been there theres a renewed energy organization from everybody ive talked to that they havent seen in a long time
2592535 that in itself can really help an organization out not only for next year but also for the remainder of this year
2592536 sit here the high general wont be expecting you for another hour yet
2592537 this is what your precious high general does he ruins people their faces their lives their
2592538 thats not how i do things but i cant go back to bryan and erin
2592539 ah my dear you look a little flushed are you well
2592540 yes high general i was just startled when the alarm went off

2592543 and who are you to judge me anyway you dont know me
2592544 your place is with the high general not a lowly rebel king
2592545 nothing my dear we just took care of some pests at last
2592546 georgia in particular had a very high level of military spending in comparison to the size of its economy
2592547 made it possible no longer to feel the necessity to believe in anything supernatural
2592548 its not god at work here in all this squalor and suffering
2592549 we have seen dramatic growth and anecdotally some passengers are saying that they are now taking the train rather than flying
2592550 its not surprising that more people are traveling to paris and brussels by train its a greener option because going to paris by eurostar produces only a 10th of the carbon emissions produced by flying
2592551 its also more convenient you wont lose your luggage and government figures show its actually quicker than short haul flights
2592552 i think they just get so focused on texting they dont see a little bump or a trip or a stumble and down they go
2592553 you try to warn them that maybe they want to do that at a different time but youre not sure that they hear you
2592554 these takeover robberies have struck at the very heart of our community because it affects the desire of people to be able to go out at night to go to restaurants and to go shopping
2592555 this has to end and we are being very aggressive in how we deal with this issue
2592556 you have to be careful when youre out here in the woods theres always a possibility that somethings gonna jump out and grab you you get between a sow and its cubs and a sows gonna do what a sows gonna do

2592573 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2592574 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2592575 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2592576 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2592577 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2592578 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2592579 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2592580 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2592582 think of it the housing bubble has reached its logical conclusion if you can get enough people to buy a home for no money down you can buy their country for no money down
2592583 you need to understand that predatory practices whereby powerful corporate and banking interests use illegal and unethical tactics to expropriate wealth from the middle class and poor are common and that the law may or may not be relevant

2592626 after this time had passed i nebuchadnezzar looked up to heaven
2592627 when my sanity returned to me so did my honor and glory and kingdom
2592628 now i nebuchadnezzar praise and glorify and honor the king of heaven all his acts are just and true and he is able to humble the proud
2592629 while these words were still in his mouth a voice called down from heaven o king nebuchadnezzar this message is for you
2592630 that same hour the judgment was fulfilled and nebuchadnezzar was driven from human society he ate grass like a cow and he was drenched with the dew of heaven he lived this way until his hair was as long as eagles feathers and his nails were like birds claws
2592631 how could a loving god do that to a human being
2592632 but let me tell you job youre wrong dead wrong god is far greater than any human so how dare you haul him into court and then complain that he wont answer your charges
2592633 in a dream for instance a vision at night when men and women are deep in sleep fast asleep in their beds god opens their ears and impresses them with warnings to turn them back from something bad theyre planning from some reckless choice
2592634 or god might get their attention through pain by throwing them on a bed of suffering so they cant stand the sight of food have no appetite for their favorite treats
2592635 but even then an angel could come a champion there are thousands of them

2592638 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2592639 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2592640 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2592641 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2592642 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2592643 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2592644 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2592645 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2592646 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2592647 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2592648 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men

2592650 mr lynch the 100 million defense happened because you brought this frivolous case
2592651 did you ever have a friend when you were five how when he lost a game threw a fit and started calling everyone names i think those who knew patrick lynch as a child might have
2592652 this is almost surreal i have never seen an ag throw a public tantrum like this before did lynch actually read the verdict from his state supreme court one can only think he has not been made aware of it yet or is in an intense state of denial
2592653 i do feel bad for him though he staked his entire future and aspirations on lead paint litigation being the next tobacco gusher for statef coffers in the end he got backhanded and lectured by the rhode island supreme court actually i dont feel bad that was sarcasm lynch is getting what he deserved a heaping portion of humble pie

2592656 actually we do not really have evidence to prove that mental illness is becoming more and more common in china
2592657 what has happened is a gradual increase in the awareness of the problem
2592658 this road is going to turn into something much bigger even though we were told repeatedly that the winchester road extension was never going to happen it seems to be very much on the cards and was referred to as being a saved option in evidence at the cannock stadium inquiry
2592659 darren handley was killed when he fell from a tower scaffold which was not the right equipment for the work he was undertaking and was also erected incorrectly
2592660 this tragedy could have easily been avoided if the two companies had properly planned the work to ensure adequate safety measures were in place for people working at height
2592661 im having such a great time weve had a great response from audiences so far
2592662 i think its a great story and quite sad in places but it really is great to be part of something new and fresh
2592663 the huge profile that tv give you is immense and i had some heavy storylines in the bill
2592664 i really enjoyed my time on the show and i adored the crew and cast they were fantastic people
2592665 the bill was a great challenge but thats what i loved about it when i left they said they wouldnt kill me off its been two and a half years since i left and im always willing to go back if the opportunity arises
2592666 we had a great time and it was a great career and we got to see the world

2592677 mrs beardsmore started her post office career as a girl of 10 when she helped her father with his duties
2592678 for many years she took round the first delivery of letters herself travelling between six and 10 miles a day on her bicycle she used to walk in the days before bicycles were in common use and it was not until the day before her 70th birthday that she gave up cycling and stopped delivering the post
2592679 after mrs woodroffe died i saw the position advertised and went for an interview at the main office in lichfield street wolverhampton
2592680 i started my week of training in may 1983 and moved into the house at the back with my husband peter
2592681 the post office has always been a big part of the community and we are all going to miss it
2592682 it is not just a place to post a letter but also pick up all the village news mrs woodroffe was a lovely elderly lady and very pleasant and cath is delightful
2592683 she has a duck noony which is a real character and knocks on her door with its beak when it wants something
2592684 i am planning on leaving it as a time warp

2592698 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was
2592699 i wont come back unless im in shape and i feel like im in decent shape you cant show up to this race if youre not in shape so it just depends on how i train id love to be back

2592936 the snp have promised a lot but the detailed legislation will need to include all of the climate change gases and emissions from international aviation and shipping if it is to capture all of scotlands direct impact
2592937 what does that have to with thumbnails dont derail a thread just because you want better a better parking spot for your comment
2592938 when is linux going to take over the desktop market
2592939 what is my mum gonna do with all that processing power
2592940 john hull manager of an engineering team at dell wanted shorter boot times
2592941 power management dont work at all then its a fail
2592942 are more interested in fiddling around than using productivity software to get stuff done
2592943 dont ever make me open a terminal window and access a command prompt
2592944 reg keys make a whole lot more sense to the average person than running commands in linux
2592945 go to the applications menu at the top left of your screen select add remove
2592946 when asked what they would have the linux community improve
2592947 john hull manager of an engineering team at dell wanted shorter boot time
2592948 ours are not proprietary ours are just not available in the community version they are open source code when you pay and everything or you become a subscriber or whatever else we dont actually keep anything closed
2592949 you shall not c modify decompile disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the software or attempt to reconstruct
2592950 my bolding oh so its open source but im not allowed to look at the code thats cool i like that i used to do philosophy it reminds me of that
2592951 im getting a tiny exhausted of that tag around our neck were a lot more competitive than people give us credit for we challenge anyone on like items
2592952 robbie is one of those players who can come in straight away and hit the ground running
2592953 he has played all his career in the premier league with a one year spell in italy so he doesnt need to take any time to settle in
2592954 he can make an impact from the first whistle there is no getting used to the speed of the game or anything like that
2592955 all he has to do is get to know the boys and tune in to their games where they like to make runs where they are going to want him to run to and so on
2592956 he will give the manager plenty of options in the striking positions he can play straight through the middle as a partner for shoulder to shoulder
2592957 or you can withdraw him slightly from fernando and play him in the hole between the strikers and midfield
2592958 he will be effective in either role you only have to look at how he fitted and moulded his game around dimitar berbatov at tottenham to see the potential that he and torres have as a pairing
2592959 berbatov scored a lot of goals from direct final passes from keane or from his movement and ability to create space
2592960 and when keane gets into position himself in front of goal he can finish as well as anyone
2592961 i live in brazil and am not going back to donetsk i hope my contract is terminated within one or two weeks so i am free for werder
2592962 i am as quick as before and still have my eye for goal i want to prove that to the trainer thomas schaaf in training and i have faith in my ability of becoming top goalscorer once again
2592963 i want to go back to werder and will be calling director of sport klaus allofs in the coming weeks i hope a transfer to werder works out
2592964 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2592965 there is still a learning curve but the understanding the base formation and our philosophy is pretty much sound
2592966 we have the possibility of being a good defense there are still some things we need to work on and i myself have to work on get my pad level down and just my recognition i think we have a chance to be solid
2592967 but how is it that fr tim managed to blog during the week
2592968 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2592969 der film ist so durch und durch amerikanisch im schlechten sinne dass einem f rmlich bel werden kann das alles wird zu einer mysteri sen kolportagegeschichte vermengt die glaubw rdigkeit und sachlichkeit zugunsten faustdicker polemik ber bord wirft dabei bedient man sich einer typologie die bestenfalls f r groschenheft niveau reicht
2592970 the impact of this film war enormous it established him as the most important film maker at work in america or elsewhere the manchurian candidate based on condons book which axelrod follows faithfully in his screenplay provoked its expected share of criticism and cries for censorship fortunately the film was too great an achievement both commercially and artistically to go down before it
2592971 i dont think so do you know how rare that is
2592972 um so i dont mean to disturb you but what do you see
2592973 i guess to wake up whenever i pleased never have to answer to anyone not have to be anywhere at any particular time and read whatever i liked all day long
2592974 thats all going to come true in the coming months
2592975 encourage all couples regardless of orientation to follow the pattern of first being married in a secular service and then being blessed in the episcopal church
2592976 there are a lot of benefits in getting out of the legal marriage business
2592977 this way the clergy and the couple can focus on the spiritual blessings the church has to offer and not the political stuff
2592978 money is important in life it does not give you happiness we all know but it sure calms the nerves
2592979 families are telling us they are cutting their food bill and trying to make the food go further
2592980 d veloppement agricole et rural durable dans le contexte du changement climatique de la crise energ tique et de lins curit alimentaire
2592981 i know i said i liked the longer posts but
2592982 the arrogance of that man to sit there as a white man in his thirties and tell a black man in his sixties that there is nothing he needs to learn about racial discrimination that is white supremacist ideology
2592983 i know that the first time i encountered the police i was 11 i was walking with my brothers who were two years older and two years younger than me a police officer came up to us grabbed them and threw them on the sidewalk and handcuffed them because there had been a report of a theft in the area we had not been doing anything we had nothing to do with the theft we were just walking on the sidewalk i understand why they did not like the police but their lives were ruined
2592984 the official was not authorized to speak on the record because of the sensitive nature of the diplomacy

2592990 the official was not authorized to speak on the record because of the sensitive nature of the diplomacy
2592991 the city of tskhinvali no longer exists there is nothing left it was wiped out by the georgian military
2592992 our losses are mounting as many as 40 military servicemen killed and over 100 wounded
2592993 the losses are also mounting among civilian population in the cities
2592994 frankly we have not expected the russian invaders to hit our residential buildings to hit our peaceful cities to hit our peaceful citizens
2592995 from the legal point of view our actions are absolutely justified and legitimate
2592996 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are a crime of course primarily a crime against their own people
2592997 this aggression led to numerous casualties among civilians in particular and virtually caused a real humanitarian catastrophe and that is already a crime against the ossetian people
2592998 at the same time i would like to stress that georgia has always been greatly respected in russia and georgians regarded as brotherly people
2592999 we have managed to down 10 russian jets and one of the pilots has been captured alive and is being treated in a military hospital
2593000 we have also destroyed up to 30 russian tanks and heavy military vehicles
2593001 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences
2593002 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2593003 is not about south ossetia it has never been in the first place it is about destroying a small democratic nation aspiring to live in peace freedom and liberty
2593004 this unprovoked long time ago planned invasion and aggression must stop
2593005 battalion task forces have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces
2593006 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2593007 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2593008 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2593009 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2593010 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2593011 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career

2593016 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others accompanying the victim
2593017 one al qaida in iraq terrorist died when he detonated a vehicle borne bomb
2593018 all the georgian guys will be leaving for the homeland
2593019 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2593020 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2593021 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2593022 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2593023 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2593024 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2593025 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2593026 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2593027 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
2593028 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2593029 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children

2593269 el hablar actual sobre dios tiende a alejarse del compromiso con los dogmas o ritos de las religiones establecidas la invocaci n a dios es quiz ansia de una fuerza que d sentido a la propia vida claro que la aproximaci n a lo divino sigue estando mediada por las grandes religiones monote stas y por el creciente evangelismo y otros cultos como hare krishna budismo yoga o cultos populares como el del gauchito gil pero ahora las v as tradicionales y colectivas de la religi n conviven con la aparici n de un sujeto que puede ser receptivo a varias creencias religiosas pero sin perder por esto su independencia su no pertenencia formal a ning n culto en particular

2593277 dios no est muerto ni agonizante al contrario de lo que pensaba nietzsche porque no es mortal las ficciones no mueren las ilusiones tampoco un cuento para ni os no se puede refutar ni el hipogrifo ni el centauro est n sometidos a la ley de los mam feros un pavo real un caballo s un animal del bestiario mitol gico no ahora bien dios proviene del bestiario mitol gico como miles de otras criaturas que aparecen en los diccionarios en innumerables entradas entre d meter y discordia as pues dios durar tanto como las razones que lo hacen existir sus negadores tambi n parece un inmortal
2593278 la religi n dijo sus ltimas palabras inteligibles nobles o inspiradoras hace mucho tiempo a partir de ese momento se convirti en un humanismo admirable pero nebuloso igual que le pas por ejemplo a dietrich bonhoeffer un valiente pastor luterano ahorcado por los nazis por negarse a actuar en connivencia con ellos no habr m s profetas ni sabios de antiguo cu o lo cual es la raz n por la que las devociones de hoy en d a son nicamente ecos de repeticiones del ayer a veces elaboradas hasta el hilarante extremo de conjurar una terrible vacuidad

2593280 coincido con hume y con kant en que el concepto de prueba emp rica es irrelevante a la hora de hablar de dios pero este punto sirve por igual contra el ate smo y el te smo el presidente bush ha aportado un buen argumento cuando dijo en un discurso destinado a complacer a los fundamentalistas cristianos que el ate smo es una fe pues no puede confirmarse ni refutarse mediante argumentos o pruebas pero lo mismo puede aplicarse desde luego al te smo ni los que afirman ni los que niegan la existencia de dios pueden reclamar de forma plausible tener pruebas de su parte ser religioso en el occidente moderno no tiene mucho que ver con la explicaci n de fen menos espec ficamente observables
2593281 el renacimiento de la religi n en el tercer milenio no viene motivado tanto por las amenazas globales el terrorismo o la cat strofe ecol gica planetaria como por la muerte de dios por la secularizaci n de lo sagrado que ha estado en el centro del proceso a trav s del cual se ha desarrollado la civilizaci n del mundo occidental

2593284 la cuesti n de la p rdida es una construcci n de nuestra sociedad porque en realidad lo sagrado es ahist rico la p rdida es relativa depende de qui n lo enuncia el mundo de lo sagrado es din mico y cambiante a lo largo del tiempo en todo caso la diferencia es que ahora hay conciencia de lo sagrado

2593320 it is a basic confucian principle that it is a person that makes a truth great not truth that makes a person great for this reason humanness or human heartedness jen was always felt to be superior to righteousness i since people themselves are greater than any idea which they may invent there are times when peoples passions are much more trustworthy than their principles since opposed principles or ideologies are irreconcilable wars fought over principle will be wars of mutual annihilation but wars fought for simple greed will be far less destructive because the aggressor will be careful not to destroy what he is fighting to capture reasonable humans will always be capable of compromise but people who have dehumanized themselves by becoming blind worshipers of any idea or an ideal are fanatics whose devotion to abstractions makes them enemies of life

2593422 i dont plan on him being back but im not the doctors either
2593423 if he goes down and starts throwing the ball and they say hes getting on the mound then you start raising your hope up but until then nothing
2593424 if everything goes great and he feels nothing he could maybe come back in september
2593425 the problem is in september theres nowhere to go if hes going to throw he s going to have to throw off the mound sometime this month and tell us if he feels good or not
2593426 all of these guys are now getting to their third year mark and they are still babies in the big leagues but this is the point where you need to learn and they are learning

2593428 weve faced some really good pitching and theyve pitched well against us but i cant say that ive been pitched any differently i just havent been swinging the bat well ill pick it up and get it going again offensively

2593444 everyone is interested in themselves since the beginning of man we have always wondered who am i and where do i fit into this world i think these online tests are going directly to the heart of the question
2593445 maybe the real function of the tests is not to convey information to the employer but to the potential employee and the information being conveyed is

2593459 it is not too much to hope that wider and deeper understanding of the gifts of diversity may eventually reduce the misuse and nonuse of those gifts it should lessen the waste of potential the loss of opportunity and the number of dropouts and delinquents it may even help with the prevention of mental illness

2593471 some of them break down and leave the testing station they cry it is as if i had tricked them
2593472 being attentive to and responding to the needs interests and abilities of individual students seems like a worthwhile goal for teachers however doing so is much more complex than administering a learning style inventory and matching teaching strategies to student learning styles
2593473 just as each snowflake tree and star in the universe is diferent so it is with children
2593474 are more likely than whites to base their decisions on thinking rather than feeling styles thinkers value honesty even if it hurts the feelings of others while people with a feeling orientation are more inclined toward harmony

2593483 people who talk in the present tense and use a lot of first person pronouns are different from people who employ the past tense and who dont often use pronouns
2593484 the first group tends to be very direct and immediate while the second is made up of more psychologically distanced people
2593485 but if it makes one think that one has embraced the totality of a personality by having a series of scores then it has gone too far
2593486 although these stories are grounded in reality they are really fictions that we make up what i want to know is not exactly what happened in your childhood but what you think happened
2593487 i am amazed i can prepare so intensely and be so acutely aware of this challenge and then be so aburptly shocked when i actually get under way a storm frightening as it often is can somehow be dealt with by actions the calm sets my nerves right on the edge

2593520 si el hombre por s solo puede decidir lo que es bueno y es malo

2593524 no se esta predicando a favor de esto ya no se est legislando ya a favor de esto
2593525 parece que hay un bombardeo ideol gico continuo para instalar esa mentalidad laicista
2593526 se quiere imponer a todo el mundo una mentalidad com n
2593527 nuestra constituci n es aconfesional y el laicismo es una confesionalidad
2593528 el aborto forma parte de esa laicidad porque da al ser humano la capacidad de elegir sobre la vida de otros humanos

2593534 nine tenths of tactics are certain and taught in books but the irrational tenth is like the kingfisher flashing across the pool and that is the test of generals
2593535 the men being irregulars were not units but individuals and an individual casualty is like a pebble dropped in water each may make only a brief hole but rings of sorrow widen out from them

2593548 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2593549 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2593550 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2593551 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2593552 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2593553 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2593554 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2593555 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2593556 that bag is rather heavy and my girlfriend will complain if i dont concentrate on her enjoy our time together and take photos instead

2593566 this appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2593567 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2593568 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them

2593597 come back by on sunday and you can have the paper off the walls
2593598 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2593599 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2593600 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2593601 we can rise together and form a new kind of government
2593602 we will pledge to return to core moral principles like stewardship service to others personal responsibility shared sacrifice and shared opportunity for everybody
2593603 we believe that quality and affordable health care is a basic right
2593604 we believe that covering all is not just a moral imperative but is necessary to making our health system workable and affordable
2593605 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance
2593606 demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2593607 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries
2593608 tough practical and humane immigration reform in the first year of the next administration
2593609 despite his advanced age ta ada engaged in street activism and braved the bullying and assaults of the armed personnel of the state
2593610 we need to refresh and revitalize ourselves with the principles that he enunciated so lucidly and so vigorously and with the actions that he undertook and which made him an exemplary fighter for the national and democratic rights and interests of the people
2593611 we are confronted by a government that is shamelessly servile to us imperialism extremely corrupt and exploitative and unrestrained in repressing the people and committing human rights violations
2593612 we are required by his teachings and example to fight relentlessly against the us imposed policy of free market globalization
2593613 the arroyo regime has been the worst in treasonously increasing the pretexts for us military intervention and for actually allowing the continuous and increasing presence of us military forces in the philippines
2593614 for the life of me i cant image that being a proportionate response to the charge that georgia has attacked russian peacekeepers
2593615 its hard for us to understand what russias plan is here
2593616 i do sense an emerging unified view among our key allies
2593617 towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict
2593618 we think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction

2593630 the public sector should operate these prisons theyre flagship so why not use titans to prove the public sector is the best at operating them
2593631 delivering prisons is unique in the public sector in that it is the imprisonment of human beings
2593632 we need really good management from the private sector and strong public sector management overseeing that the public sector mustnt aggregate responsibility on the private
2593633 integration is quite important for titans as there is a question over whether it is safe to have so many prisoners in the same place good design is crucial for the operators
2593634 every projection shows that the size of the prison estate needs to be increased and quickly
2593635 we have no views on what types of prison titans or otherwise are needed but we are concerned how long they will take to get built
2593636 so long as the prisons are working effectively they are suitably staffed and those who need to be detained are detained we would not have any difficulty with the idea of titans
2593637 ive been involved in prisons for nearly five years and id happily live next door to one prisons create employment and theyre quiet neighbours
2593638 an enormous response from the investment community as a result of our unique differentiator of investing with women run funds we have a database of close to 350 women running funds that are managing over 60bn 30bn in assets
2593639 the decision to focus on the funds run by women was motivated by the fact that women have a harder time raising money
2593640 we felt that by identifying talented women who had great returns and capacity available in their funds we would be getting access to overlooked managers this was not and is not a socially responsible investment programme although we are not opposed to social responsibility the fund is all about sourcing better than benchmark returns from an under utilised pool of superior managers
2593641 that the chief executives sex affected just about everything we asked respondents what percentage of their investment money theyd put into the firm it was astonishing participants were willing to invest 300 per cent more in a firm run by a male than in a firm run by a female
2593642 the thing that surprised me about these findings is that the participants were given identical materials the only things that changed were the name and gender of the ceo and with that you get astonishingly different reactions
2593643 from us investors concerned with emerging managers which is the category where women and minority investment firms fall weve also received interest from banks and high net worth platforms they like the fact our fund of hedge funds is a great diversifier there is little or no overlap with our fund managers in other products
2593644 a seeding business can be an extraordinary business opportunity that is a derivative of our fund
2593645 this is another reason why we are so interested in finalising a joint venture with an institutional partner it will allow us to pursue this business line as well
2593646 our managers have weathered the recent market turbulence quite well
2593647 i expect to have built with a strategic partner a large and broad based asset management business with assets allocated to the most talented women and minority investment managers across strategies from hedge funds to traditional funds to private equity
2593648 i expect my husband to keep making me laugh keep providing me with wise counsel and to continue his incredible support
2593649 there are fewer discounts being offered in the late market consumers are upgrading to long haul and all inclusive products and there is a pick up in 2009 bookings
2593650 we do not want to see directors paying themselves more while paying shareholders less
2593651 it means that besides losing our capital we lose our income
2593652 dividends are supposed to smooth out the business cycle and companies should think carefully of the consequences before cutting
2593653 the recent difficulties faced by large established uk businesses have served to undermine shareholder confidence people have begun asking who is ultimately responsible for administering sound corporate governance and have they been asleep on the job
2593654 its important institutional shareholders are part of the solution they have the money and the long term interest and they have the rights
2593655 equity holders are the ones with votes bond holders have an interest in getting their money back but they dont have the levers
2593656 the equity holders have to be part of the solution not part of the problem and they will be more likely to do it if their rights of pre emption are preserved
2593657 it creates economic activity in this area that for many years wasnt doing well
2593658 to take away peoples tax dollars and spend it on art that usually is funded by private benefactors is just unbelievable
2593659 the mayor believes that we should spend tax dollars for entertainment and culture and he calls himself a republican
2593660 it just adds to the tourism product we have here
2593661 its a place making type of action in this city ten years from now well be very thankful

2593664 the bank of england will have to increase its inflation forecasts revising cpi to at least 4 5 per cent with the potential to rise to just under 5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008
2593665 with the rising cost of energy and food inflation is not likely to go down any time soon though it should stay below 5 per cent
2593666 the third quarter will be tough but the fourth quarter may begin to see a fall in inflation the bank will do its level best to prevent rates rising but will hold for the next two to four months before we might see a fall
2593667 significant amount of investment in spite of the credit crunch
2593668 collins stewart must be bleeding because i know that we are

2593678 for a moment i thought it was time to move on i was very close to resigning
2593679 i suppose a braver person would have resigned there and then in the post match press conference but i didnt and im glad ive got my appetite back
2593680 it doesnt seem to be affected by the credit crunch at all but football as a whole will be especially at the lower level there is clearly an issue with the amount fans pay to watch football its time the sport gave something back to the fans
2593681 in a way the credit crunch is focusing the minds of boards we cannot keep taking we are looking at ways to bring in new fans at birmingham or every kid out there is going to be a man utd or chelsea fan because they are the only teams they ever see on television and they win a lot
2593682 profits will hold up because you cut your cloth accordingly
2593683 here is a man who had a three month option to buy the club
2593684 it was a mistake for him and a mistake from us to structure the deal in such a way
2593685 the fans can be assured we wont consider any negotiations for the next nine months
2593686 ralph decided to take a step back and enjoy plenty of fishing and golf but thats not for me
2593687 im glad im not in the airline business any more id like to think it was a piece of genius when we sold but it wasnt i did feel it was time to move on but the main reason was that i was planning for the future my two daughters will inherit the business i think it is just time to simplify things
2593688 the internet was having a major impact the new management are still hopeful of turning it round by trying to enter the daily star market its not the route id have gone but good luck to them
2593689 of course we are feeling the effects of the credit crunch but if the high street is down 5 per cent well be down around 2 per cent we have always outperformed in recession times
2593690 we had the same thing in the miners strike with party plan compensating for a decline in other parts of the business
2593691 during times such as the credit crunch women come to the fore in the household where for example a girl might normally do one party a week to supplement her income when the husband has no overtime she ends up doing two
2593692 we have plans for 18 more stores but we arent in any hurry we have a pilot store in valencia and maybe before the end of the credit crunch well start rolling out 12 new stores in spain this is the time to do deals
2593693 i vividly remember 87 and 92 but this is very tough i have a portfolio of shares and i would say my investments have probably dropped by about 4m collectively
2593694 i used to short years ago on the advice of my stockbroker but i hate the very concept it youve got to hope that someone fails for you to win i just dont like it
2593695 these results imply that overweight sedentary women joining a fitness center with the intent of weight loss or body fat change will likely fail without support and without altering their diets
2593696 nearly 50 percent of people who start an exercise program will quit within six months
2593697 this study attempted to discover what takes place in the real world when overweight women attempt to lose weight
2593698 i think the outcome of the study speaks volumes about the necessity for a multi pronged approach in order to lose weight body fat and gain health benefits i hope that this will be the first in a series of studies investigating commercial weight loss programs
2593699 too fat too thin too short too tall tto straight too curly
2593700 the komodo dragon which once survived on padar island has become totally extinct
2593701 their droppings can no longer be found there there is no clear reason for its extinction but rampant poaching of deer and wild boar its main prey and encroaching habitat due to forest conversion and wild fires are strongly believed to be among the causes
2593702 the number of komodo dragons is estimated at 2 500 scattered on komodo rinca and gili motang islands
2593703 the populations of wild boars and deer have gradually depleted on padar island and most of its forested areas have been damaged by fires
2593704 we are still determining the main cause of its extinction on padar island
2593705 according to our plan we will conduct a survey to ascertain the natural conditions on padar island and at the same time make an inventory of their prey in the area
2593706 we are very puzzled i cannot think of any reasonable explanation for their decision not to renew it

2593714 im working on project x which you will love when i can show it to you
2593715 here are 5 earrings i finished for my etsy shop click here to buy them
2593716 this is my latest scrap lay out to download the specifics click on the paypal button at the end of the post
2593717 the only one im curious about for game 1 is our center hardwick
2593718 well know 10 days to seven days before our opener against carolina but otherwise i am extremely thrilled about the medical report on our players
2593719 norv turner was the right coach at the right time
2593720 im even more convinced of that this year after last year i know people looked at me like i was crazy i know people looked at the schottenheimer firing like it was a personality conflict and it didnt go any deeper that wasnt the case
2593721 i cannot stand the cautious conservative win enough games thinking
2593722 id love to keep my job but if theres a championship out there im going to try to go get it
2593723 so youre down to have a look at our great team
2593724 my greatest challenge was knocking liverpool off their f perch and you can print that
2593725 ive never been more confident of anything in my life
2593726 i think were better than last season every year the expectations are similar you want to improve you want to be contenders you want to be closer to winning the title i think we have the quality to do that but you never know because the others are strong united and chelsea are the best teams in europe so it will be difficult but we will try
2593727 when we signed for example fernando morientes we thought he was the striker we needed because he was good in the air and had quality but he couldnt cope with the physical demands of the premier league keane has more experience and knows what to do here
2593728 im probably more delighted than the rest of the lads because robbie is one of the opponents who has caused me all kinds of problems down the years
2593729 hell always weigh in with 15 20 goals but he is a goal creator as well as a goalscorer i dont like putting pressure on other players but robbies in the same mould as keegan dalglish and beardsley for me he is the perfect liverpool no 7 the comparison between keanes partnership with torres and the one that dalglish had with rush a few years ago could be a valid one
2593730 its not just about progressing on the pitch you need to progress in all the other areas and then maybe we can improve
2593731 are we sure this new design means the updated list of requirements
2593732 what can i do to help you do your best work
2593733 tang has no criminal record his neighbors said they hadnt seen any abnormal behavior from him before left hangzhou

2593735 this appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2593736 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2593737 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them

2593744 young people are thinking it is acceptable fashionable and necessary for them to protect themselves by carrying a knife but just like we made guns unacceptable we should be making knives unacceptable
2593745 you need role models to do that you need evidence that carrying a knife makes you less safe and you need parents and other people saying that knives like guns like bullying like racism are unacceptable people in the community have to rise up and say this is unacceptable behaviour we will see a campaign not just led by government but by people in the country to get knives off our streets and i think we will see people responding
2593746 britain is still a decent compassionate society and most people want to see things change for the better
2593747 a lot of people talk about a broken society i dont think the british people have ever been broken by anything or anyone
2593748 a young guy in london they call britains young barack obama
2593749 courage is not some godlike quality of fearlessness but people feeling strongly about things and showing the willpower to do something about it
2593750 you have got to look at what holds us together
2593751 in 1707 when scotland joined the union with england only 3 per cent of scots had english relatives and most had nothing to do with people in england
2593752 we share the same bonds of our liberty democracy social cohesion and respect for the same institutions i wouldnt like a scot to be denied healthcare in england and there are economic connections and big questions of environment and security on an island all of us are together a partnership on equal terms is the right thing for the future
2593753 if we dont play our part in helping africa and other countries to solve their problems other people will offer easy solutions including the route to terrorism this is a security problem as well as a moral ethical and social problem
2593754 what we have to build up and this is the lesson of barack obama and everybody else is this idea of global citizenship that we have responsibilities to each other and share the same ideas as each other
2593755 i didnt know what to expect when i began it takes so long just to get from a to b a lot of the places weve trained in so far have such massive panoramic scenes in front of you you feel like youre not really moving you get lost in taking one step after another training has taken over most of our lives outside work every holiday for the last two years has been an expedition holiday there has been no time with my wife and 18 month old baby
2593756 we want to take shackletons compass the original compass to the south pole
2593757 i like the idea of the festival but the bad thing is ive never been to a show im always in the shop working its great to see all the different nationalities coming in and sometimes the odd celebrity comedian
2593758 we open 24 hours over the whole festival unfortunately and the amount of customers we serve almost doubles we get quite a few drunk people coming in too which can be difficult and the odd one has an evil attitude but most people are friendly
2593759 i wasnt prepared for it at first but weve been here a few years and im used to it now
2593760 a shop like ours is always in debt because we buy stock on credit the extra work in august brings a financial benefit and the shop clears its debts for a brief time
2593761 the festival is marvellous i love all the visitors to the city and the events at the fringe venues as well as the edinburgh tattoo the high street looks amazing in august and there is a good atmosphere i never see any trouble myself
2593762 most of the events are in the town centre and they dont spread out as far as the pub
2593763 the pub gets quieter during the festival we do get some visitors but they are usually people who are staying in the area and come out to their local which is nice
2593764 i think it would be good if the festival expanded but it costs 600 just to get on the programme which for a wee boozer like ours is out of the question still i hope it continues
2593765 i think we should take the festival and have it in zimbabwe to cheer everyone up although it would be hard to tell the performers apart from the politicians in that country
2593766 i have never been here to perform before and it is quite a frightening experience coming into the heartland of modern comedy people have been very nice to me so far i am overwhelmed by their kindness
2593767 there is not much money in playing here despite getting sell out shows because it costs so much to promote it but i didnt come here to make money i came here to be stretched as a performer i came for the challenge i have been a working comic for 36 years and i want to see where i am in the batting order
2593768 the city is much busier during the festival because of all the special events but i start work at 7am so its still possible to get there easily
2593769 we also have to work extra hours till 9pm rather than 4pm i do have a family but they are grown up so the longer hours dont have too much impact on my home life its only for three weeks anyway and i enjoy meeting so many different people
2593770 its quite funny having tourists come up to you to ask where the car park is when they are standing right by it
2593771 the extra hours mean a bit more money at the end of the month which helps towards paying the bills
2593772 i love the festival for the influx of tourists from all over the world and i enjoy giving them assistance and helping them
2593773 ive seen many stage shows and i wanted to see joan rivers this year but i was too late to get tickets
2593774 unfortunately there is a criminal element which comes out to prey on people flooding into the city but we have dedicated patrols day and night in the high street to try to counter act that and we spend the five weeks before the festival building up to it
2593775 its harder work because its busier and i have a lot more to deal with but i enjoy it
2593776 i think the festival is fantastic for the city and long may it continue to grow
2593777 the festival affects my work because a few of the companies involved use us to dispose of their waste so it gets really busy for three weeks
2593778 if you have to work longer hours then so be it i sometimes get calls at night to come and take away festival rubbish and i go and do it i can take anything thats thrown at me the extra work means a bit more money so its worth it i put the money back into the business and its usually my wife who gets treated rather than me
2593779 we see about 350 people in a amp e in a normal day but that rises by at least 10 per cent during the festival there are a lot of patients from outside the city who have forgotten medicines and also performers who have fallen off the stage and injured themselves
2593780 we try to advertise alternative services like nhs direct because some people come to a amp e for inappropriate reasons which is a big problem for us when we are busy anyway for the festival
2593781 if at the end of three years local government has not delivered on those building blocks i think there will be some really big questions to be asked about its capacity to commission these services in the future
2593782 we have been concerned about councils being in charge of assessing peoples needs and then deciding how much should be spent on them there have been concerns about the quality of care offered to older people in particular at least threatening local authorities with sanctions if they do not improve can be of benefit
2593783 councils are best placed to make decisions on providing care and support to local people thanks to their knowledge of whats available in each area and how best it can be managed
2593784 its not standing on one leg shouting arrrr jim lad is it
2593785 pilates was devised by a german born gymnast for rehabilitating injured british soldiers returning from the first world war by building muscle strength through slow controlled movements
2593786 it might seem odd that one of the goals of britains biggest branded truck company is to get trucks off the road but that is exactly what we are trying to do
2593787 it seems ironic that we are now looking to revive more traditional modes of transport but new pressures such as congestion rising fuel prices and the environment mean the old methods are becoming viable again
2593788 britain is covered with castles that were built in medieval times when people had to protect themselves from invaders but there are no longer battles and no one is suggesting that we restore them to their original function why should it be different for canals we cant influence the prevailing economics the amount of subsidies given to canal transport dwindles into insignificance alongside those given to roads because canals are not judged to be a transport network
2593789 in cases where it would cost 11 per tonne to transport some cargo by road and 10 per tonne to transport it by water companies often stick with road because it is the tried and tested option
2593790 be the main breadwinner and leave the wife to look after the kids be strong and silent with biceps the size of your girlfriends beehive
2593791 i would like to make it clear to the people out there to police and the rich people like lord rothschild if i feel the need when i have got to rob a stately home i will do so i feel i have got the fucking right to rob the lords out there i feel i have got the right to rob the lords sirs and the ladies
2593792 a lush and secretive valley hidden behind the belfast hills and offering breathtaking views
2593793 years of history have disappeared at the stroke of a pen weve had dire times before but we have always managed to pull something out of the hat finance is more important than history it seems
2593794 the movement is in decline and its very sad where will working people go to socialise will they become confined to their homes
2593795 if you are old and you have been going to one of these clubs all your life you have nowhere else to go they were also places which brought the generations together
2593796 they were owned and run by the men themselves and because they were private members clubs the police could not simply barge in
2593797 they also fulfilled a charitable function before the emergence of the welfare state
2593798 how can i trust god with so many problems in my life why doesnt he just take them away if he wants me to trust him
2593799 the public sector should operate these prisons theyre flagship so why not use titans to prove the public sector is the best at operating them
2593800 delivering prisons is unique in the public sector in that it is the imprisonment of human beings
2593801 we need really good management from the private sector and strong public sector management overseeing that the public sector mustnt aggregate responsibility on the private
2593802 integration is quite important for titans as there is a question over whether it is safe to have so many prisoners in the same place good design is crucial for the operators
2593803 every projection shows that the size of the prison estate needs to be increased and quickly
2593804 we have no views on what types of prison titans or otherwise are needed but we are concerned how long they will take to get built
2593805 so long as the prisons are working effectively they are suitably staffed and those who need to be detained are detained we would not have any difficulty with the idea of titans
2593806 ive been involved in prisons for nearly five years and id happily live next door to one prisons create employment and theyre quiet neighbours

2593809 currys been to the logies a few times but as he says himself hes always felt like hed stepped in
2593810 i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was mad i was almost fighting for the leader for the lead in the tournament and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the whole round the rest of the round
2593811 i went home and went to sleep not even thinking about golf but today when i woke up i wanted to play golf again
2593812 both vehicles were speeding and the truck was in the wrong lane it is possible the driver had dozed off and didnt notice the truck
2593813 soon after the vehicle crossed the noida toll bridge around 4 20 am the driver noticed a truck hr38j 6717 coming from the opposite direction and tried to brake the headlights of the truck were not working and hence it was not visible from a distance the truck was speeding and it collided head on with our qualis
2593814 i received a call around 4 50 am and rushed to the hospital hes thankfully out of danger
2593815 there were several obstructions and our men tried to stop the truck but the driver kept accelerating and before our patrol vehicles could rush there the accident happened
2593816 the shift from 6 30 pm to 3 30 am got over and around 20 25 people were going home another car which was moving in front of the qualis also had a close shave with the truck coming from the wrong side the driver of the first car tried to alert fateh singh but by then it was too late
2593817 i say luck is when an opportunity comes along and youre prepared for it
2593818 tang has no criminal record his neighbors said they hadnt seen any abnormal behavior from him before left hangzhou
2593819 we are now looking for tangs ex wife and elder brother hoping to find out what he did before the incident in beijing and figure out his motivation
2593820 this appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2593821 tang has no criminal record his neighbors said they hadnt seen any abnormal behavior from him before left hangzhou
2593822 we are now looking for tangs ex wife and elder brother hoping to find out what he did before the incident in beijing and figure out his motivation
2593823 this appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2593824 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2593825 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2593826 we had been working on this project for two years the device will be made available to government run schools shortly
2593827 these esbs can be modified as per the class in which the children are enrolled for instance a student enrolled in class iii wont have to carry books and guides to schools as all such study material can be stored in the esb similarly esb for other children enrolled in higher classes can be modified as per their study material
2593828 we are also approaching district and state education officials to take forward the concept of hi tech education in government schools

2593843 at a point when young people are most likely to be supervised it is extremely expensive to insure them
2593844 which happened quite a lot because of the amount of beer id drunk
2593845 that said we believe this competition provides invaluable experience quite often we choose pupils for the mock trials who arent the most outgoing yet because of the confidence they gain from taking part they go on to become our head boys and head girls weve even had former team members choose the law as their profession
2593846 obviously we hope that some of these children will become the lawyers and magistrates of tomorrow
2593847 at the same time we hope that all of them will acquire a much fuller knowledge of the justice system
2593848 but we are in no doubt that children who take part will go on to become better adults and citizens as a result
2593849 i had become increasingly disillusioned with my job as a teacher and i was firmly single
2593850 i was also extremely overweight despite constant diet attempts im 5ft 3in and was almost a size 20 weighing nearly 14 stone
2593851 on the last morning of my holistic holiday in devon i had what i can only describe as a complete epiphany while strolling in the grounds of the hotel i decided to write the book i had been thinking about for years and to be slim and fit from that moment on my life was going to change
2593852 fired with enthusiasm i started writing immediately around my teaching job
2593853 my fitness became interlinked because when i wasnt writing into the small hours i was taking long walks to think i wasnt slumped on the sofa snacking
2593854 within a year id written the first draft of my book and id lost more than five stone the following year i met and fell in love with a wonderful man and i published the first book in the stonewylde series
2593855 today i look and feel 10 years younger and run in the park most days whereas five years ago on that holiday i struggled to complete a walk on dartmoor and was filled with self loathing martin proposed to me on my 50th birthday last september and we married in december ive given up teaching to concentrate on my writing i know i would never have changed my life so totally if i hadnt done some hard thinking on holiday out of my normal environment
2593856 id contracted the virus guillain barr syndrome which destroys the nervous system i lost the use of my legs and at one stage my mother was told the next 24 hours were critical
2593857 thankfully i made a good recovery although i still have no heat or pain sensation in my limbs and have to use a thermometer to check bath water and food temperatures after four months i returned to work in a pr agency but the long hours were just too draining my health scare had made me realise how precious my health was and i knew i had to change my work life balance i went to malaysia to contemplate my future and try to get my body back to some normality but i didnt expect i would come up with such a drastic step
2593858 i had spent holidays in anglesey and realised i loved being by the sea
2593859 i now sail regularly and i have joined the rnli as a shore crew volunteer two nights a week even driving to the supermarket lifts my spirits because it is along the most beautiful coastal route i am inundated with friends coming to stay and i have made lots of local friends i wake up and i feel full of zest if i hadnt had time out to think about how to achieve a better life for myself i would still be in the same rut
2593860 it was our first self catering holiday with barnaby and our eight month old daughter maisy
2593861 far from being relaxing it was very stressful a split level sitting room with hard tile floors with no stair gates
2593862 in the evenings my husband rob and i spent a lot of time mulling over the potential for letting out child friendly but aesthetically pleasing holiday houses it seemed a perfect marriage between householders who would want to extend their letting period and families with pre schoolers who werent tied to the school holiday season
2593863 within six months of writing essays about marketing strategies business plans and research i had realised my idea for renting child friendly holiday homes really did have legs and i should get cracking

2593867 decent summer holidays are one of the few perks of a demanding underpaid profession do they want teachers to hand in their notice and train to be accountants
2593868 i have traipsed around the natural history museum so many times i could scream
2593869 never mind the cost of keeping children entertained in london the fact that fewer and fewer parents feel confident about letting their children play outside has turned some households into pressure cookers in the summer a four week break from school would be ample
2593870 there has to be enough space to meet everyones needs children dont just want a summer holiday with their family they want to spend time away from school doing things with their friends if you try to cram all that into a four week period something will get squeezed out
2593871 i would hate to miss that quality time with my son
2593872 children work so hard these days that they need time to unwind time just messing around doing nothing in particular is an essential part of childhood
2593873 a plan shouldnt be put in place so that it deals with future market conditions that dont exist today that dont allow development to occur in the foreseeable near future
2593874 market conditions dictate development patterns if you put a plan in place that mandates a development pattern where a market doesnt exist that means that property cant develop because they are stuck in between what a future goal is of a city for an urban center but there is no need in the marketplace for an urban core to be developed
2593875 under the law not only would we not take their property without compensation we cant do that
2593876 were not allowed to do that so if we need a section for a parkway or a street or something there is going to be negotiations and agreements and there will be adequate compensation either in the form of payment from the city or us building streets and water retention areas that otherwise they would have to build
2593877 it would be different if we were sitting on high in crystal covered offices saying you need to do this and you need to do this not having realistic expectations of whats happening in the marketplace
2593878 i would have bought land it became so valuable when i lived in tempe i used to drive through chandler because it was rural and quaint there was literally nothing south of mcclintock and southern the enormous growth in chandler today was happening in tempe in the 70s
2593879 i was a band geek we were in a competition at asu and there was some sort of sudden turn i fell flat on my back and was devastated when we finished the show i apologized to the band director who told me i was out of step for the rest of the show but he is a great guy and we still stay in touch and share memories
2593880 when i ran for student body president my senior year i spent 37 on the campaign if id known it would cost 200 000 to run for mayor of mesa i may not have chosen a political life
2593881 i would have walked and knocked on even more doors with my mother when she campaigned for barry goldwater
2593882 my experience in the marching band was great what really sticks in my mind was the first time i conducted the star spangled banner i was absolutely terrified but it was a very moving moment
2593883 if i had known my high school friends would be a part of my life 40 years after graduating id have tried to make more friends
2593884 they tell us theyre going to build condos now its rentals more people more crime and renters dont take care of their property like we do
2593885 thats common right now you see new neighborhoods with streets that just dead end and empty lots where the developers just walk away
2593886 its a tough economy for people to buy homes right now but there is a definite need for high end luxury rentals in places like chandler

2593891 at the end of the day its very hard to fire somebody lets make it so that we only accept the highest quality people at the outset the theory is ill have less headaches down the road
2593892 some people are concerned about it but im excited as hell it bodes well for the future here

2593899 it might be broken we dont know but in some ways theres not much point in doing much about it now because the games on so its one of those where well assess it at the end of the game
2593900 he did brilliantly because it was definitely no more than a half or a third chance
2593901 he got a hand on it but if you watch the footage back hes got an awfully long way to get there
2593902 he moores likes to challenge us on a daily basis
2593903 we have lots of strong characters who can be very opinionated the crux of the meeting was to decide where we can take the team together

2593905 inside according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2593906 house leadership aides pushed back against interpretations of this comment as self aggrandizing
2593907 o ne leadership aide said the full quote put it into a different context
2593908 house democratic aides got up thursday morning and decided that the quotes looked bad
2593909 hopefully we neednt go through all of this again but to make sure everybodys clear my colleague jonathan weisman and i believe the quote was correct as written and that this supposed context is a recreation after the fact by democratic aides who were worried about how the quote looked perhaps obama didnt mean for it to come out that way but theres every reason to believe it did
2593910 im happy to see dana taking a firm stand im a little more squishy
2593911 an understanding going back years that he is giving me privileged information from closed meetings it is by definition on background with someone you interact with constantly there just arent the formalities of sourcing on every conversation and e mail
2593912 unimpeachable when he gives you a quote you can take it to the bank you dont need to go around verifying it with others
2593913 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol

2593919 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2593920 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2593921 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2593922 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2593923 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2593924 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2593925 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2593931 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits
2593932 winter officially ended this week so thats good news yeah today al gore blamed the end of winter on global warming sunday of course is easter another big problem for barack obama this easter sunday wheres he gonna go to church easter of course is the time we celebrate miracles see we dont have miracles like easter and the resurrection and the parting of the red sea anymore you know what im saying like today our idea of a miracle is gas under 3 50 a gallon boy there is nothing but disasters in the news its unbelievable floods in the midwest fires in texas the democratic party its just unbelievable to give you an idea how bad the democrats are doing in a stunning reversal john mccain now 10 ahead of hillary clinton and 7 ahead of barack obama and this is after iraq a recession and no health care imagine how far ahead hed be if the republicans had actually done something this week john mccain received a warm welcome in israel he was in israel you know he is hugely popular in israel ever since he stood with the jewish people against the pharaoh theyve never forgotten president bushs approval rating has reached a record low 31 wow his popularity is so low now on his facebook page he only has imaginary friends the cover of time magazine asked the question what did hillary do as first lady well we know what she didnt do bill and osama bin laden has released another anti american speech and out of force of habit barack obama denounced the remarks and said he wasnt even in the room at the time the statements were being made anyway critics are pouring over osama bin ladens latest audio tape simon called it pretentious paula said it was not his best work and randy said dog its just not working for me according to a new study by the university of british columbia and harvard money can buy happiness but only if you spend the money on someone else to which former governor eliot spitzer said see according to the new york post eliot spitzer has entered therapy for his sex addiction he has sex addiction hes not horny a sex addiction see i dont know if its gonna work when the therapist told him it was 300 bucks an hour he said what can i get for an extra 50 have you heard about this playgirl magazine made an offer to eliot spitzer to appear naked in the magazine isnt that unbelievable i tell you you know who really wants to see that spread former new jersey governor jim mcgreevey in tibet the rumor is the dalai lama might be stepping down yeah it turns out he was client number 11
2593933 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
2593934 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
2593935 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
2593936 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
2593937 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president

2593942 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
2593943 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street
2593944 who was killed and why were they killed and will we be cause we know some stuff maybe
2593945 in virtue of what is that true is that a priori synthetic analytically true a posteriori necessary a priori synthetic or a priori necessary if it is the latter does that entail tacitly that our natural language semantics presupposes the metaphysical claim that there are existential a priori analytic propositions

2593989 to me speech writing is an art a thing of great power and great delicacy
2593990 a speech is part theatre and part personal declaration its a powerful means of communication between a leader and his or her people speeches are how we measure public people they tell us who they are where they are going and what part we will play in their progress
2593991 it is often speeches not strategies that can shape what happens
2593992 try and think about the last time you heard a politician or ceo say something so clever and engaging it has remained imprinted on your mind
2593993 every memorable moment in history has started or ended in a speech it is speeches not politics that start and end wars it is speeches not policies that can bring about radical change within a nation
2593994 imagine how different our world would be without the speeches of kennedy churchill nelson mandela gandhi martin luther king or even hitler
2593995 i think people underestimate the power of oratory its a forgotten art i find it unbelievable that speeches arent given fair weighting or even consideration in the marketing communications mix
2593996 when i watch people in leadership positions delivering mediocre speeches i cringe a well crafted speech can get you a promotion win you an election or better still ensure you are remembered forever
2593997 i see a lot of corporations focus their energy on developing strategies to achieve business objectives only to then announce their initiatives through an uninspiring and mechanical speech a launch speech of poor quality can often kill the entire strategy before its even implemented
2593998 clients are usually people who have both personal and business objectives they want to meet i seek to create a response to the person more so than a response to the speech and the message i want people to go away thinking no wonder that person is in charge of this company or portfolio
2593999 the success of the message depends a lot on the sincerity commitment and confidence of the speaker a good speech captures those qualities which fortunately my clients possess otherwise they wouldnt have risen to the position they are in
2594000 when writing a speech my first task is to understand the audience and where their perceptions may differ from the speakers i need to know the audiences frame of mind their fears their hopes and their level of trust my goal is to then develop a line of logic and emotion for the speech that addresses the audiences concerns and beliefs
2594001 you cant deliver an impersonal and lifeless speech passionately the words of the speech have to capture the speakers passion for the topic its a big part of the power that moves the audience along the speakers line
2594002 speech delivery training helps the speaker learn how to use their body to enhance what they are saying a well placed gesture can have a profound affect on the success of a speech you have to look at the speech holistically the content the gestures and the way the words are spoken its a performance
2594003 its not just about being able to write powerfully using the spoken word
2594004 its vital you are naturally creative as you need to think outside the box or in fact re invent the box
2594005 tomorrow the equipment will be turned on to start the first oil exploration for 20 years at a ceremony which will be attended by the oil minister and senior officials

2594052 activision continues to grow and drive greater value for our shareholders by broadening our portfolio and entering new gaming categories with strong global appeal bizarre creations is the leading independent developer with a proven track record in developing highly successful and influential original properties especially in the racing field they are one of the most innovative and creative studios in the industry and we are very excited to welcome this talented creative team to activision
2594053 activisions independent studio model will continue giving us creative freedom to build exciting new brands their financial support and marketing prowess will also enable us to build upon the commercial success that we currently enjoy and take the company and our games to an even higher level
2594054 you cant assume it is going to be like the other platforms because you are going to have nintendo taking most of the sales and if nintendo really sees you as a threat they will take the moves to wipe you out they are not going to let you win
2594055 meaning if you sell your game and you are charging usd 60 or 50 or whatever price you choose they will sell their games at usd 39 99 and they will kick your ass so the bottom line is whatever you thought your business plan was they can shake your world at a moments notice and they have a track record of doing that so i would be very concerned with wanting to bet the farm on a nintendo platform
2594056 codemasters respects mr barkers creative ideas despite the german distribution and marketing consequences for the title therefore codemasters will release only the pc version of clive barkers jericho in its original form for adult gamers and clive barker fans
2594057 games are all about accuracy if you request something it better happen the wii controller adds some slop to the system and that in turn goes against the golden rule that controls should be tight and perfect something that nintendo has lived off for years im surprised how unimportant these things seem to be to people that a slight inaccuracy is acceptable
2594058 all we want to concentrate on is making great games rather than the pressures of running a pretty large development studio searching out deals spending months and months on legal and due diligence procedures that are the norm for signing up a game nowadays
2594059 we want to be doing what we love in the way that we enjoy without having to think about being big business people it was a long and hard path coming to this decision but we were driven by our desire to continue being able to deliver great games and to enjoy doing it
2594060 they have a hands off approach to game development meaning were left to do what were good at and can ask for support from their strong development network should we need it one of the most important reasons from our point of view is that activision has an independent studio model meaning that we can continue to be bizarre

2594067 were thrilled to have identified clear signs of water on a planet that is trillions of miles away
2594068 water is the quintessence of life as we know it it is exciting to find that it is as abundant in another solar system as it is in ours
2594069 water is the only molecule that can explain that behaviour although hd 189733b is far from being habitable and actually provides rather a hostile environment our discovery shows that water might be more common out there than previously thought and our method can be used in the future to study more life friendly environments
2594070 the holy grail for todays planet hunters is to find an earth like planet that also has water in its atmosphere when it happens that discovery will provide real evidence that planets outside our solar system might harbour life finding the existence of water on an extra solar gas giant planet is a vital milestone along that road to discovery
2594071 there are a thousand things to learn about these planets
2594072 finding water on this planet implies that other planets in the universe possibly even rocky ones could also have water
2594073 the discovery of water it the key to the discovery of alien life

2594123 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one
2594124 a nation healed a world repaired we are the ones that weve been waiting for
2594125 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance
2594126 dat lesje hebben we in de loop der jaren geleerd

2594128 almost perfect yesterday i finished very nice and now with this round i cant believe it i have a chance for tomorrow
2594129 the rough is difficult but the most important thing is i played great fairways and greens the whole round
2594130 my confidence has been building the last two days i played very well yesterday as well
2594131 i like to call this new system creative capitalism an approach where governments businesses and nonprofits work together to stretch the reach of market forces so that more people can make a profit or gain recognition doing work that eases the worlds inequities
2594132 how selfish soever man may be supposed there are evidently some principles in his nature which interest him in the fortunes of others and render their happiness necessary to him though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it
2594133 tell me where can i go theres no place i can see where to go where to go every door is closed too me
2594134 when i dwell with you i do so in the present i live in the present not the past although much can be remembered and learned by looking back but only for a visit not an extended stay and for sure i do not dwell in the future you visualize or imagine mack do you realize thatyour imagination of the future which is almost always dictated by fear of some kind rarely if ever pictures me there with you
2594135 it was his her time to go because god needed him her in heaven
2594136 mack just because i work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies doesnt mean i orchestrate the tragedies dont ever assume that my using something means i caused it or that i need it to accomplish my purposes that will only lead you to false notions about me grace doesnt depend on suffering to exist but where there is suffering you will find grace in many facets and colors
2594137 mack is me a guy who has made a mess of everything
2594138 the book takes him mack outside everything familiar back to the worst experience of his life and lets him recognize god is so much greater
2594139 we dont need these were going to be with you
2594140 we believe there was a lot of democrat switchover vote
2594141 it is legal in the state of tennessee for democrats to go switch their allegiance in a primary from what we saw around the polling places yesterday we saw people with democrat state rep nathan vaughn of kingsport and phil roe campaign literature together i think we won the republican primary with republican primary voters yesterday i think he ultimately won the election with democrat switchover vote

2594170 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business
2594171 i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
2594172 j w is an exceptional young man who is the chief aide to the attorney general and who is almost indispensable in terms of the many functions he carries out in this office
2594173 he walks into a room and you want to follow him somewhere anywhere
2594174 ill do whatever he says to do ill collect paper cups off the ground to make his pathway clear
2594175 everythings going to be affected by this seismic change in the universe
2594176 this is not a campaign for president of the united states this is a movement to change the world
2594177 i have thrown myself into a new world one in which fluffy chatter and frivolous praise are replaced by a get to the point directness and disciple like devotion then in a moment of divine intervention he saw me grabbed my hand and gave that brilliant smile of his i literally said out loud to the woman next to me who witnessed my good fate ill never wash this hand again
2594178 politics doesnt even begin to describe it a visit to an obama rally is a pilgrimage
2594179 followers willing to wait for hours on end to hear him speak have been crowding out huge concert halls and sports arenas to get a glimpse of their new progressive avatar and drive long distances to obtain the obama darshan or to simply be in his presence many even see in obama a messiah like figure a great soul and some affectionately call him mahatma obama
2594180 many spiritually advanced people i know identify obama as a lightworker that rare kind of attuned being who has the ability to lead us not merely to new foreign policies or health care plans or whatnot but who can actually help usher in a new way of being on the planet of relating and connecting and engaging with this bizarre earthly experiment these kinds of people actually help us evolve
2594181 sookies the only one in town who isnt terrified of vampires when she meets bill its the first relationship shes ever been in and for the first time she can just relax
2594182 hambaku yang mana saja dari hamba hambaku yang menunaikan jihad pada jalanku kerana mengharap dan mencari keredhaanku aku jamin untuk mengembalikannya jika ia akan ku kembalikan apa yang didapatinya berupa pahala atau harta rampasan dan jika ia ku matikan dalam perang sabil itu ia akan ku ampuni ku beri rahmat dan akan ku masukkan ke dalam syurga

2594201 this is the countrys favorite past time and i am sure fans on guam will look forward to the playoffs but whether their team will make it past the playoffs will have to be seen
2594202 national sporting events shown on guam are a big thing sponsors and advertisers trying to target men will definitely be able to see a return on their investment based on the amount of male viewers that watch sports
2594203 this is the fourth time fox sports will cover this event and each year the coverage keeps getting better and better racing fans will not be disappointed when watching the daytona 500 this year
2594204 daytona continues to draw thousands of viewing fans on guam it is one of the most heavily watched television motor sports events in the u s mainland and the same is true right here on guam
2594205 it wont be personal in eight to 10 years time when we get together for a reunion but we want everyone to stay loyal

2594207 we had just come off premiership years and there was a bit of feeling of us younger blokes trying to steady the ship so to speak while all the older guys were retiring
2594208 but at the end of the day it is everyones individual choice
2594209 if we leave it is like bailing out when things get tough you cant do that
2594210 what does that say about your character id be very very surprised if luke or any of our other players who have been a part of the last four to five years leave because theyre not that kind of people
2594211 i dont think the players or leadership groups and clubs by extension should deal with those sort of issues
2594212 and worse different clubs deal with it in different ways
2594213 it is simply unacceptable for players in todays society to put themselves and members of the public at risk with their behaviour

2594224 coaches make those decisions whatever they do theyre the bosses
2594225 that happened on a thursday and he played on a saturday and it never happened again
2594226 this is the best thing for chris and his future
2594227 if they dont place him on injured reserve he will be able to play this year and theres no doubt i think he will come back a stronger and more confident player for the rest of his career
2594228 we did a lot of it last year especially in the second half
2594229 he could make all the throws and it was a little different because he was a left hander
2594230 the republic of south ossetia consists of a checkerboard of georgian inhabited and ossetian inhabited towns and villages the largely ossetian capital city of tskhinvali and most of the other ossetian inhabited communities are governed by the separatist government while the georgian inhabited villages and towns are administered by the georgian government this close proximity and the intermixing of the two communities has made the conflict in south ossetia particularly dangerous since any attempt to create an ethnically pure territory would involve population transfers on a large scale

2594236 for me its up there its just a funny movie a great movie
2594237 it was just his personality his persona they say a big part of life is laughing and he was one of the best at making people laugh
2594238 he was a baseball fan he loved the cubs hes going to be missed not only in the comedy world but the whole realm of sports because of the type of person he was
2594239 its funny to see the way he went around cracking jokes the old guy coming back cracking jokes with the young guys
2594240 i dont want to take a chance with him in the outfield i dont want him to have to make a throw he doesnt need to make
2594241 when i was with the giants they had a veteran mind set
2594242 with barry bonds there the pressure was to win he wanted to win so they were going to surround him with guys who could give him that opportunity but it seemed like every veteran that came in would get an injury and it wouldnt work out
2594243 ive always been able to play the game im just trying to find an opportunity thats what has avoided me the past four years
2594244 a broad pattern where increased forecast costs for venues are offset by reduced forecasts elsewhere including site preparation and infrastructure

2594348 la casa donde uno vive marca mucho la vida el m s lejano recuerdo de mi vida es cuando ten a 4 a os puedo describir y hacer el mapa en concreto del piso donde viv amos en sevilla all nacimos todos los hermanos desde all nos fuimos a una casita en las afueras de sevilla en un pueblo que se llama gines a mi padre abogado lo amenazaron de muerte y tuvimos que refugiarnos en la casa de los abuelos paternos poco despu s mi familia se fue al campo y yo me qued con ellos en un apartamento frente al r o guadalquivir acab la guerra civil y decidieron irse al norte de espa a a probar fortuna inauguramos un piso formidable en pleno centro de vitoria la capital de alava aquello fue un fracaso y todos se volvieron a sevilla dej ndome a m interno solo a mil kil metros de distancia de ellos a los dos a os me llamaron y vivimos esta vez en la casa de la abuela materna entonces estaba en tercero de bachillerato finalmente nos mudamos a un piso en la calle san vicente fue la ltima casa que habit con mis padres y hermanos

2594353 an expression of delight that so often came with a persons recognition of some aspect of their personality identified by the indicator the earth moves the heavens open the world suddenly makes sense
2594354 these are the people who immediately figure out the type of everyone they know whose everyday speech becomes an alphabet soup of indicator acronyms who can explain just about every situation they encounter with reference to the types of the individuals involved
2594355 it will not do to assume that certain jobs can be successfully handled only by a narrowly limited range of character types
2594356 people of radically different types can adapt themselves to perform adequately enough a wide variety of complex tasks
2594357 theres no bad worker and no bad workplace only a bad fit between the two its a conveniently fatalistic philosophy workers cant be trained in new skills or grow into new responsibilities and workplaces cant be expected to accommodate their developing needs and abilities
2594358 why do so many people fall in love with the mbti one of its principal attractions is no doubt its reassuring confirmation of what we already know about ourselves
2594359 another aspect is its comforting stability as cozy and familiar as an old sweater because a persons type does not change it instantly confers a clear firm identity often just at the moment when it is most needed when people are switching jobs looking for a partner feeling lost and purposeless
2594360 and myerss relentlessly positive orientation ensures that everyones permanent personality is a good one it also offers an attractive way to understand relationships with others no longer complicated and mysterious friends family and acquaintances are now easily understood with reference to their types shes a total esfp conflicts are not due to genuine differences of opinion or interest but simply to the divergent ways various types comprehend and communicate

2594366 la verdad es totalmente interior no hay que buscarla fuera de nosotros ni querer realizarla luchando con violencia con enemigos exteriores
2594367 aunque este nuestro hombre exterior se va desgastando el interior no obstante se renueva de d a en d a

2594373 im an iconoclast im hip and i reject your mainstream culture you cant market to me
2594374 my exact motto over the years has pretty much been the same
2594375 we treat every car as if it is our own car
2594376 its not about the money we have to have a good relationship with the customer
2594377 cars come in and you dont even get to see the customer
2594378 the car is in the back and you dont even get to see whats happening to it you dont get time to do an inspection because the volume is so many its so much different than what we do here
2594379 everyone of those customers is like jewels to us because they bring more customers
2594380 the bottom line is we decided to take care of customers
2594381 two hungry people should never make friends if they do they eat each other up it is the same with one person who is hungry and another who is full they cannot be real real friends because the hungry one will eat the full one only two people who are full up can be friends they dont want anything from each other except friendship

2594388 they say that the watch you wear can define your personality so be it
2594389 one word frees us of all the weight and pain of life that word is love
2594390 attention is the most basic form of love through it we bless and are blessed
2594391 love is like quicksilver in the hand leave the fingers open and it stays clutch it and it darts away
2594392 to be in love is merely to be in a state of perceptual anesthesia
2594393 love is everything its cracked up to be thats why people are so cynical about it it really is worth fighting for risking everything for and the trouble is if you dont risk everything you risk even more
2594394 love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness
2594395 maybe love is like luck you have to go all the way to find it
2594396 love has no awareness of merit or demerit it has no scale love loves this is its nature
2594397 love is like war easy to begin but hard to end
2594398 love consists in this that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other
2594399 loves makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place
2594400 love is more than three words mumbled before bedtime love is sustained by action a pattern of devotion in the things we do for each other every day
2594401 a love song is just a caress set to music
2594402 love is an act of endless forgiveness a tender look which becomes a habit
2594403 love is like a violin the music may stop now and then but the strings remain forever
2594404 love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence
2594405 in the final analysis love is the only reflection of mans worth
2594406 love doesnt make the world go round love is what makes the ride worthwhile
2594407 oh life is a glorious cycle of song a medley of extemporanea and love is a thing that can never go wrong and i am marie of roumania
2594408 to love is to suffer to avoid suffering one must not love but then one suffers from not loving therefore to love is to suffer not to love is to suffer to suffer is to suffer to be happy is to love to be happy then is to suffer but suffering makes one unhappy therefore to be unhappy one must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness i hope youre getting this down
2594409 it is in the best interest of students to hold them to high expectations
2594410 they will rise to the expectations you hold for them
2594411 vocational schools were established to help those students who were not college prep and to prepare them for the work force and i think they did a wonderful job of that
2594412 to me they have lost sight of their mission and focus
2594413 i look at it from pure math what is halfway to a high diploma seven is a third
2594414 if you can complete one third of your required courses halfway through high school you can come in is that standard too high
2594415 some of our students who have been very successful would not have even qualified
2594416 they would have never gotten in and yet they graduated and did very well
2594417 i have seen kids go through there and changed their lives because they had some kind of noncollege way to go after they graduated from high school i am nervous about the change
2594418 why are we making it more difficult for kids who obviously need something different which is what apollo provides and they do a great job at it
2594419 lets set higher expectations and start exploring better intervention at the middle school and high school level
2594420 it is really tough when youre talking to an eighth grader

2594423 he was so incredibly talented and gifted he had the audience wrapped around his fingers everybody loved joe
2594424 when people mention the lima symphony they mention joe he was the lima symphony
2594425 he embraced me every year joe and his wife sent flowers to me on opening night
2594426 he was a man who had a very big heart something he certainly gave to me and to the community
2594427 first of all he loved music that was his great love and he wanted to share that love with the community

2594449 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2594450 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2594451 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2594452 there was a ruling on the motion to suppress statements made by the defendant in that case but weve been advised that those statements will not be suppressed
2594453 king of the pecos which is good the good news is that these films are better than the ones in the other collections
2594454 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2594455 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2594456 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2594457 by setting that thermostat at 78 it might not be as comfortable as 73 but every degree you put it below 78 youre actually adding 4 7 to your bill

2594471 the question about subsidized gas supplies is particularly important since you will frequently hear about how russia wields its energy supplies as an instrument of policy first of all this is not all that incredible or even all that sinister since the energy companies are state run industries that are going to be used to give the government leverage overseas but even then the coverage of the change in subsidy levels was misleading since it emphasized that the price was going up and neglected to note that ukraine was still receiving the supplies at a heavily discounted rate even so what would normally have been greeted as a welcome reduction in government distortion of the market price was seen as a dastardly ploy to punish neighboring states

2594523 provincial elections in kirkuk will be postponed for a period not extending beyond december 2009 during which time
2594524 unami is seeking a fair and balanced solution and the proposal to distribute authority among the kurds arabs and turkmen of kirkuk at 32 percent each and 4 percent for christians is a fair and balanced formula that we favor
2594525 there is no change in this policy and there will never be
2594526 the kirkuk problem is not going to remain a mere kurdish problem massoud barzani is not aware of the amount of hatred kurds are attracting from the turkmens and the arabs through the turkmens this is an issue of turkey and through the arabs this has a terror dimension as the turkmens are shiite this also has an iranian element in it
2594527 the stability of iraq means the stability of the region
2594528 understandably the kurds did not like this equality which does not represent the citys actual demographic realities they wanted the referendum to take place and the representatives be shared accordingly their pressure worked and president talabani sent the law back to parliament adding to the crisis massoud barzani declared the city a part of the kurdish regional administration in northern iraq
2594529 representatives of the kurdish alliance at the kirkuk provincial council demanded in a press conference that kirkuk be annexed to the local administration in the north of iraq
2594530 they know very well that the only way to establish an independent kurdish state is to annex kirkuk to it and the only way to prevent turkey from blocking this process is to have turkey busied with the kurdistan workers party pkk
2594531 the arabs are not held responsible for what was inflicted on kurds turkmens and even arabs themselves
2594532 we believe in democracy that is why we always call for peaceful dialogue to address concerns related to kirkuk the kurdistani status of kirkuk does not mean it is not an iraqi city the new iraq has been based on its constitution and consensus article 140 will not expire unless the constitution also expires we are not aggressive against those who are ideologically different from us
2594533 we know what oppression and persecution mean because we were wronged for decades therefore they are no longer acceptable i want to ensure those who intend to go back to the baathist tyranny that era is over
2594534 massoud barzani is perceived as somebody that can be educated only with fists terrorist attacks may help the neocons to convince barzani to come to terms with their plans or to punish him for his failure to do so
2594535 the terrorist attack in kirkuk came before the aforementioned local elections law was reviewed up until the kirkuk attack the tension between the kurds and the arabs was not so visible and people thought that this was something between turkey and the regional kurdish administration this is not true and most probably this is going to evolve into kurdish arab tension and the terrorist activities will move further north
2594536 what we see in kirkuk is the outsourcing of terrorism the pkk in turkey is being manipulated just as al qaeda is the ergenekon terrorist organization as we know it is another outsourcing mechanism they all converge as they go up none of these are national they are all parts of a global web
2594537 global web controlling the pkk al qaeda and ergenekon at the same time
2594538 turkeys problem with regard to the kirkuk and turkmen issues is the fact that the turkmen issue was always handled by the army the army is too nationalist and too sensational by definition the army is never a good organizer and cannot reach civil society turkey was trying to unify the turkmens but what it succeeded in doing was exactly the opposite the turkmens were segregated and turkey lost its influence over them iran and even al qaeda have more influence among the turkmens today
2594539 what we have now is people who know how to use weapons and who now want to play politics
2594540 there is no doubt the violence will increase in kirkuk if its case does not get solved
2594541 we found out that armed action will not get the united states out of iraq

2594595 the realization of the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline and the baku tbilisi erzurum gas pipeline as well as their successful exploitation provided the groundwork for ideas for azerbaijan turkey and georgia to further deepen their relations the result of which was the baku tbilisi kars railroad project

2594642 with the nda were unable to talk with one another
2594643 we want the developer community to be a lot like the open source developing community where you can help and talk to one another about the best way to do these things

2594651 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2594652 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2594653 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all

2594681 he is a combination of ability and a big heart and the geordies love that
2594682 it was a really good pre season game they were a good side and showed their quality
2594683 they were good on the ball and comfortable from back to front

2594717 lets go to another independent forum that doesnt delete critical posts
2594718 i was told by a lot of people that the nfl is easier than college i think thats true
2594719 coming from miami all of the veteran guys come back and tell us what to expect they tell us what made them successful and what we should look for at the next level
2594720 guys are big and fast but im big and fast too football is the same at every level
2594721 what hes been doing in practice he showed up in the game and did it thursday night hes making good progress
2594722 i just wanted to go out and have fun just go out there and play ball
2594723 i wanted to see where i was as far as being able to play at this level ive felt pretty good so far
2594724 it definitely felt good to be able to hit somebody
2594725 it was hard for me to hold back at practice but it felt good just to tackle someone this whole camp theyve been telling me to lay off guys its been kind of i dont want to say depressing but not to finish a play thats not like me it felt pretty good to finally be able to let go
2594726 i didnt think that the speed was that different a lot of guys made my transition easier by telling me what to look forward to it definitely was a piece of cake for me
2594727 its almost the same thing but it has different names
2594728 i wouldnt say im pleased because i always want to do better but for this game my first preseason game i think i did okay
2594729 its a little different going from practice to a game
2594730 obviously when youre in a game environment its going to be different mentality wise its going to take a while to get used to it but its been a benefit to us because we do a lot of things as far as dummy signals it does work to our advantage weve just got to get used to it
2594731 its not distracting ive just got to get used to it
2594732 it will probably become second nature to me once i use it a little more defensive players have never had this but the quarterbacks have had it for awhile they probably felt the same way about it when it first came in its something weve just got to get used to we are just going to keep working with it in practice while were here in albany and in the next few preseason games
2594733 my statement is none of them can rent a car none of them are old enough
2594734 i have so many notes that i write for them every day i can understand why theyre so confused
2594735 its like trying to put out a forest fire with a garden hose you got stuff going on everywhere so where do you start we have a lot of things to fix there but its exciting and its encouraging its good for me i have to slap myself sometimes and say you cant assume that they know that you got to start over again so i walk in the door and say this is the football you cant expect them to understand things that theyve never experienced a lot of first things happened in the game the other night
2594736 these guys come in they got equipment director joe skiba
2594737 my biggest mistake as a coach is i make assumptions that these guys might know or have been through some of these experiences and that happened a little bit in the game the other night there were a few unique things that happened and they just caught us by surprise because we havent really when you look at these guys although kevin and mike matthews both played last year they didnt play very much and kevin didnt play very much at all until the end of the year and mike was primarily a fullback in theory were basically starting over at this position for those guys to play on the line of scrimmage beside the tackle
2594738 i thought this afternoon we had some decent intensity on defense but not as much as i would like on offense
2594739 thats where we are thats where we have to improve
2594740 he is excited about it i think his running has increased and hopefully well get something done here ive talked to plax and ive showed him our schedule he knows exactly the time thats left to prepare ourselves he agrees that we certainly dont want to break camp without having him gotten anything done here at all
2594741 you want to know what can happen this is what happens

2594850 we have unrealistic expectations for people john edwards like the rest of us is only human
2594851 the truth is a lot of ordinary average americans have affairs
2594852 weve got one of the ablest candidates ever nominated and hes running against a man who really pretty much promises more of the same of what weve had the last eight years
2594853 i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2594854 the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2594855 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2594856 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention
2594857 obviously a lot of people believed in john edwards people were passionate about his candidacy i think there are people who feel let down when you invest that much time and energy in a candidate and the candidate turns out to be less than you thought
2594858 the american public has become sensitized to this type of behavior from political leaders
2594859 neste lugar de simulambuco foi assinado em 1 de fevereiro de 1885 o tratado que integrou o territ rio de cabinda na na o portuguesa
2594860 it is eyeing the vote bank in view of the assembly polls
2594861 the bjp is once again playing the communal card at the grave cost of the nations unity and integrity this time the arena of action is the border state of jammu and kashmir where they are playing with fire only with an eye on the vote bank ahead of the assembly elections in that state earlier the bjp and its mentors in the sangh parivar had backed an outfit demanding separate statehood for jammu if kashmir is with us today it is because of the composite culture and geographical diversity it shares with the other two regions jammu and ladakh
2594862 any popular support to such political parties serving narrow selfish interests will be detrimental to the nations interests and territorial integrity
2594863 i am also a born shaivite and we are for providing all facilities to pilgrims even the kashmiri people including the separatists have no objections to it
2594864 i do not think any true hindu would become rigid and obstinate to wrest back that land at the cost of indias unity and integrity
2594865 now that the certificate has been issued yamada can start procedures to get the passport and visa i dont think there should be a problem
2594866 we have allowed manji to stay with her grandmother who is now her sole guardian
2594867 im definitely better but the ankle is swollen lets see whether if required ill be able to bat tomorrow
2594868 im better yes but cant say whether i can resume bowling in the morning
2594869 yeah i had to get a big one but the job isnt complete we need to get as big a lead as possible and its not going to be easy
2594870 to ensure stability authorities have strengthened controls on non residents to root out trouble and stepped up controls on key people religious figures and trouble making petitioners to stay abreast of things
2594871 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2594872 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2594873 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2594874 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2594875 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2594876 the united states and russia must take the lead in striving to abolish nuclear weapons
2594877 these two countries should begin implementing broad reductions of nuclear weapons instead of deepening their conflict over among others the introduction of a missile defence system in europe
2594878 i vow to lead the international community for permanent peace
2594879 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2594880 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2594881 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2594882 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2594883 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2594884 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2594885 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2594886 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2594887 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2594888 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2594889 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2594890 if anyone asks a man that he will slap you
2594891 why dont you hook up 10 dogs and take salem on a two miler
2594892 the next 24 hours are critical and we appreciate all your thoughts and prayers
2594893 the u s olympic family is another family for todd and barbara
2594894 they were very excited about making this trip to china one of the messages that came back was to a friend of todds an e mail after the opening ceremonies letting her know that todd had seen the opening ceremonies and enjoyed them and was inspired by them
2594895 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2594896 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2594897 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2594898 here in calgary we need warm bodies for jobs the public sector city post office are understaffed because they cant compete with the private sector
2594899 our economy is in terrible shape and it is only going to get worse as more companies lay off full time employees
2594900 this is a sign of the continuing massive failures of the harper regime things will only get worse
2594901 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2594902 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2594903 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2594904 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2594905 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2594906 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2594907 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2594908 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2594909 i got some ice cream i got some ice cream and you can not have some because youre daddys a alcoholic na na na na

2594914 the blues was created there rocknroll seeped into memphis from that mentality white people trying to sound black white people who were just as poor as black people
2594915 as lending criteria tighten first timers are turning to foreign shores to live their investment dream
2594916 our research shows that more than four in five think their money will go further overseas that so many buyers are prepared to get their first taste of home ownership in a foreign land speaks volumes for the state of todays domestic market
2594917 with property prices falling faster in the uk than elsewhere in europe except for spain the continent may be seen as a safer place to buy because declines are less likely
2594918 these two countries are popular because they are easily accessible from the uk and people have gone there on holiday
2594919 elsewhere prices in france remain strong particularly in the south and the alps while in italy there are some cheaper options in calabria and puglia
2594920 prices have fallen considerably and the exchange rate is very favourable
2594921 first timers who cant get a mortgage on a uk home are picking up more affordable properties in bulgaria hungary and poland
2594922 price increases and rental returns abroad may look good on paper but buyers need to approach with caution and particularly if they are relying on rental income to make their investment work
2594923 also bear in mind that while you can get a lot more for your money in other parts of the world cheap is not always best think seriously about what you want from the property in terms of capital growth or rental income from letting it as a holiday home say
2594924 this can lead to wide variations in outgoings as the exchange rate fluctuates from month to month
2594925 to avoid these extra costs we urge overseas buyers to consider locking into an exchange rate in a process known as forward contracts
2594926 we knew there was no way we could afford a place in central london
2594927 the uk market looks pretty gloomy at the moment and we were concerned about ending up in negative equity
2594928 we are both keen skiers and chose a place high in the alps that you can ski right up to
2594929 in an ideal world we would have bought our first home in the uk but we just couldnt afford to
2594930 shocking stats reveal that executives remain chained to desk during the summer family holiday
2594931 our message is leave the phone off the hook and get stuck into those sandcastles
2594932 the pace of decline has slowed for the second consecutive month offering some of the first signs of a gradual return to positive price growth
2594933 a fish must swim three times in the sea in olive oil in wine
2594934 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2594935 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2594936 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2594937 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech

2594946 football clubs are not playing fair with fans these accounts pay pitifully poor rates of interest
2594947 among the worst offenders are those clubs that think nothing of spending tens of millions of pounds on new players each season they deserve to be shown the red card by savers
2594948 what happens is that at the end of the year the building society works out how much money is in the football savings accounts and then hands over the equivalent of 0 5 to 1 per cent interest to the club this is above and beyond what the saver receives
2594949 championship and even non league clubs offer these accounts too and for some of these clubs money is very tight the revenue they get from persuading fans to sign up could be a real help
2594950 check if your husband has ppi payment protection insurance for any of the non mortgage debt which could pay out if he is made redundant also seek advice about benefits he could claim if he loses his job
2594951 then work out what you would have coming in and going out as a couple if he is made redundant and what if anything the ppi policy on the mortgage will pay out with all this in place approach the creditors with an affordable offer
2594952 the isa is due to be opened tomorrow and the new account details should be received in the next few days it is nationwides policy to backdate isa transfers to the date on the cheque issued by the old provider and therefore there will not be any financial disadvantage from the delay we apologise for the inconvenience caused by the delays in the transfer process as a gesture of goodwill we will be sending 50 for the stress and inconvenience caused
2594953 with the danger of online banking fraud the procedures described are absolutely necessary to ensure the security of funds
2594954 the five day freeze allows us to write to the customer alerting them to the request and giving them the chance to check the new account details are correct
2594955 if you thought cancer ward was funny wait until you get a load of anne franks diary
2594956 its quick which is crucial if the seller needs the cash to pay off debt whats more the seller gets to stay in their own home which can be of huge benefit if for instance they have children in local schools
2594957 once the property is handed over there is no security of tenure it can be sold by the new landlord whenever they wish
2594958 even more worryingly if the landlord gets into difficulties the tenants can find themselves on the street due to repossession proceedings that are none of their doing
2594959 with so many people worried about repossession they are maximising their opportunities you only have to open a newspaper to see all the adverts for the schemes
2594960 the attraction for the landlords is getting the property below market value but i have heard of some instances of people being offered 60 per cent of market price for their home
2594961 there are lots of forums out there about this topic and when i read them its frightening you have people with a few grand in their back pocket simply taking out adverts in local papers and seeing if they can get a property as cheaply as possible hoping to sell the home from under the tenant for a profit when the market improves the danger is we all get tarred with the same brush
2594962 some older people in their 50s and 60s who dont have a big pension are seriously looking at sale and rent back to release the equity they have in the property
2594963 if you sign up to sale and rent back you are committing to paying rent potentially until you die if you cant afford it in old age the landlord is perfectly within his or her rights to evict the potential for abuse is appalling
2594964 the industry needs to be regulated and fast we need to be on a level playing field
2594965 certainly anyone considering sale and rent back should only go with someone who has signed up to the code
2594966 it sounds a clich but pvrs really have revolutionised tv viewing
2594967 to say that this fundamentally changes how you watch tv you are no longer tied to the schedule and are free to pick and choose from the list of programmes that youve recorded on your box so you can scan the tv listings find the things that appeal to you many of which may be on too late for you to watch and zap them with your tv remote and they will be automatically recorded for you to watch whenever you want
2594968 as far as the companies are concerned getting people to bundle all three services is their holy grail
2594969 but crucially bundling works for consumers too having your phone tv and broadband with separate providers is the most expensive way to go
2594970 an enormous response from the investment community as a result of our unique differentiator of investing with women run funds we have a database of close to 350 women running funds that are managing over 60bn 30bn in assets
2594971 the decision to focus on the funds run by women was motivated by the fact that women have a harder time raising money
2594972 we felt that by identifying talented women who had great returns and capacity available in their funds we would be getting access to overlooked managers this was not and is not a socially responsible investment programme although we are not opposed to social responsibility the fund is all about sourcing better than benchmark returns from an under utilised pool of superior managers
2594973 that the chief executives sex affected just about everything we asked respondents what percentage of their investment money theyd put into the firm it was astonishing participants were willing to invest 300 per cent more in a firm run by a male than in a firm run by a female
2594974 the thing that surprised me about these findings is that the participants were given identical materials the only things that changed were the name and gender of the ceo and with that you get astonishingly different reactions
2594975 from us investors concerned with emerging managers which is the category where women and minority investment firms fall weve also received interest from banks and high net worth platforms they like the fact our fund of hedge funds is a great diversifier there is little or no overlap with our fund managers in other products
2594976 a seeding business can be an extraordinary business opportunity that is a derivative of our fund
2594977 this is another reason why we are so interested in finalising a joint venture with an institutional partner it will allow us to pursue this business line as well
2594978 our managers have weathered the recent market turbulence quite well
2594979 i expect to have built with a strategic partner a large and broad based asset management business with assets allocated to the most talented women and minority investment managers across strategies from hedge funds to traditional funds to private equity
2594980 i expect my husband to keep making me laugh keep providing me with wise counsel and to continue his incredible support

2594998 uk pension schemes enjoyed a brief period of surplus until early in 2008 no sooner have companies breathed a sigh of relief about returning to surplus but they are back to multi billion pound deficits

2595003 both vehicles were speeding and the truck was in the wrong lane it is possible the driver had dozed off and didnt notice the truck
2595004 soon after the vehicle crossed the noida toll bridge around 4 20 am the driver noticed a truck hr38j 6717 coming from the opposite direction and tried to brake the headlights of the truck were not working and hence it was not visible from a distance the truck was speeding and it collided head on with our qualis
2595005 i received a call around 4 50 am and rushed to the hospital hes thankfully out of danger
2595006 there were several obstructions and our men tried to stop the truck but the driver kept accelerating and before our patrol vehicles could rush there the accident happened
2595007 the shift from 6 30 pm to 3 30 am got over and around 20 25 people were going home another car which was moving in front of the qualis also had a close shave with the truck coming from the wrong side the driver of the first car tried to alert fateh singh but by then it was too late

2595013 all these merchants around here have worked so hard on this and our committee has been working on this for a year
2595014 it means good business they all have to eat somewhere they all want to go buy a little something as a souvenir and so we hope everyone will take a little something from beaufort home with them
2595015 its going to be a lot better than any one weekend weve had
2595016 were going to advertise it even more next year when we do it again but weve done pretty well
2595017 when i would bring it up he would laugh it off and blow me off
2595018 all the way through the deal and through the press conference i wasnt certain it was going to happen
2595019 when peter said he wanted to talk to wayne privately i was sure they were going to pull the plug on it
2595020 it was the day that the hockey world stood still and then it has a seismic impact on hockey in the u s
2595021 you see california kids all of the time on junior rosters and there are many california kids and 95 of them are there because of gretzkys presence in california
2595022 gretzky captured the imagination of a lot of young people who wanted to be him
2595023 as a singular event you can argue that wayne going to los angeles was as much a catalyst for participation growth in this country as anything in the last 30 years except the miracle on ice in 1980
2595024 it is difficult to overstate the significance and positive impact the trade had on the league and particularly in u s markets which were non traditional hockey markets
2595025 i wasnt just the fact that wayne was the most dominant of all athletes in their respective sports it was his personality and demeanor and the way he championed hockey and the nhl
2595026 he is without a doubt in my mind the greatest ambassador of hockey that the sport has ever known
2595027 i stopped the car and said to a friend you know if we were in canada kids would be playing ball hockey or inline hockey here and it would be amazing
2595028 a year later there was a sign on the fence that said no inline hockey allowed and i was like weve come a long way
2595029 frankly when we first heard that it was potentially in the works i thought it was a joke the thought that he could be traded in the prime of his career didnt seem reasonable
2595030 one symbol of the magnitude of the deal was that espn carried the news conference live from edmonton and this was at a time when espn didnt do a whole lot of that
2595031 there was a mob scene at the press conference and they were breaking into television shows to report the trade
2595032 but everybody knows those trades are coming this gretzky deal shocked people i certainly remember the outcry from edmonton fans after it happened
2595033 in todays world i dont know if that would be allowed
2595034 walking in glen sather pulled me aside sat with me for a good hour trying to convince me that if we wanted to block the deal he could
2595035 he wouldnt speak to me or peter when this was going down
2595036 peter called and i thought we were going to talk about players again and i put him on the speaker because i wanted wayne to help me talk about players
2595037 i wanted him to nod to me if he wanted this player or that player and in the middle of the conversation peter made some nasty statement about gretzky
2595038 right away we became a contender that was the talk
2595039 when you came into our locker room it was like being at the oscars
2595040 one time after a game im getting undressed i look up and theres goldie hawn standing there and i have nothing on
2595041 when we went in there with our purple and gold uniforms we felt like we didnt even belong there
2595042 but when we had gretzky and we were dressed in silver and black it was different
2595043 its like some historian said its amazing someone so unsubstantial could do something so substantial
2595044 the conservative government has announced it will no longer fund a federal program that subsidizes international promotional tours of canadian artists
2595045 i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was mad i was almost fighting for the leader for the lead in the tournament and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the whole round the rest of the round
2595046 i went home and went to sleep not even thinking about golf but today when i woke up i wanted to play golf again
2595047 s programming from a to z everything you wanted to know about text but were afraid to ask prophecyboy adam simon on digital media gaming live performance and other forms of geekery resources a database of sources for physical computing parts methods software and other resources
2595048 what the caterpillar calls the end of the world the master calls a butterfly
2595049 thats what theyre there for providing us with water and thats a very admirable thing
2595050 but on the other hand they still need to abide by the law
2595051 we had been monitoring that area in the past few months and we were aware that nesting was going on and thought the nesting had concluded
2595052 we werent aware of this one last nest had we known we would have held off
2595053 investigating to see if this is a concern we need to pursue further
2595054 irish coach charlie weis is tougher than i am that i can tell you so its easier playing for an easy going guy like me
2595055 obviously playing in front of 80 000 people at notre dame pays big dividends it doesnt faze him when he comes here
2595056 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2595057 i dont know if either one of us has a lot to be proud of today
2595058 i think both of us will be looking to get some momentum in the morning hoping it will carry us through on whats going to be a long day
2595059 this isnt the ryder cup week we have three weeks to go i want a guy who is confident and if the guys confidence is shattered when he left here join the club
2595060 i spent a lot of time in the fitness trailer ive got an elbow issue
2595061 so i was warming it up and then id go practice then re warming it up and then going to practice again and i was eating and watching the olympics and talking and taking a nap i just kind of covered all the bases
2595062 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2595063 after a couple of weeks we get together to eat and talk
2595064 they are nice and they teach me how to do my work
2595065 this is a town thats home to 26 nationalities we never bothered to do the statistics or research ourselves but generally speaking weve always had many different people from many different backgrounds
2595066 the right people who could appreciate and enjoy this type of work
2595067 they kind of mingle among themselves and they dont bother anybody
2595068 some of them have left because they dont like slaughterhouses but a lot of them have decided to stay for now
2595069 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
2595070 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses
2595071 it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the beijing olympics
2595072 jugaremos a las cinco de la tarde cuando el campo estar muy caliente se va hacer complicado porque son un equipo que se van a encerrar atr s pero a diferencia del d a de costa de marfil en el que jugamos algo nerviosos saltaremos al campo m s tranquilos
2595073 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2595074 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2595075 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2595076 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2595077 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2595078 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2595079 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2595080 china is employing an unprecedented level of state of the art digital technology to suppress media freedom
2595081 the downside to any tweaking however is that pushing components beyond their rated limits can make a system unstable but is mozilla jinxed
2595082 reading a users hard drive contents alone wasnt enough for kotler who claimed that function alone bored him after a period of time the pitfalls of open source litigation
2595083 but anything thats free costs way too much nowhere is that more applicable than in open source software enterprises using open will lsb 4 standardize linux
2595084 he and two colleagues from northwestern university in illinois soko matsumura and frederic rasio are the first to model the formation of planetary systems from beginning to end a process that in real life can take 10 million years
2595085 a nice peaceful and polite and well behaved planetary system like our own only happens more rarely
2595086 wow if we were just 1 closer to the sun we wouldnt be alive
2595087 global warming is a lie its a conspiracy we dont need to bother researching it because it was invented by liberals to control us
2595088 agave does not require much water for cultivation making it favorable over many of the alternatives
2595089 sugar cane which is used widely in brazil for ethanol production is grown in tropical regions and can drive deforestation
2595090 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2595091 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2595092 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2595093 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2595094 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2595095 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2595096 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2595097 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2595098 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2595099 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2595100 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2595101 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2595102 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2595103 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2595104 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2595105 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2595106 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2595107 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2595108 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2595109 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2595110 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2595111 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2595112 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2595113 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2595114 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2595115 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2595116 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2595117 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2595118 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2595119 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2595120 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2595121 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2595122 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2595123 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2595124 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2595125 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2595126 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2595127 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2595128 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2595129 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2595130 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2595131 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2595132 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2595133 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2595134 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2595135 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2595136 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2595137 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2595138 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2595139 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2595140 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2595141 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2595142 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2595143 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2595144 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2595145 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2595146 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2595147 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2595148 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2595149 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2595150 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2595151 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2595152 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2595153 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2595154 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her privacy now or in the future
2595155 we call for an immidiate investigation in this attempt on cuestas life which follows a pattern that journalists in the philippines know only too well
2595156 journalists in the philippines are frequently killed and assaulted with impunity all for doing their jobs in the past 10 years at least 25 journalists have been victims of premiditated murder in connection to their works
2595157 identify and funish those responsible for the shooting which comes just a month after the murder of a journalist in quezon province
2595158 in no way in the conflict between the russian and georgian military implicated
2595159 in the wake of the aggression launched by the georgian side against the south ossetian civilians and russian peacekeepers a lot of very complicated humanitarian problems have arisen which we need to address in line with our mandate and simply in line with the duty that our state has
2595160 you guys want an independent kosovo okay then support a free south ossetia
2595161 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
2595162 hey guys we have a terrible human rights record in a country that isnt even ours lets poke our noses in other peoples business
2595163 bush tells china to stay out of other countries affairs
2595164 words contain meanings like a bottle holds a perfume both convey messages that can be interpreted and experienced in an immense variety of different ways each of them communicates an essence a thought a shared experience messages in bottles have always signified belief and a hope for the future using advanced serigraphic techniques evolved from traditional printing methods the original comme des garcons 2 pebble shaped bottle has been lacquered in black to contain silver words of peace freedom and love in several languages the result is a deep matt black colour surface holding an infinate mesage of hope stamped in silver words
2595165 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2595166 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2595167 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2595168 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2595169 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2595170 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2595171 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2595172 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2595173 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2595174 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2595175 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2595176 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2595177 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2595178 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2595179 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2595180 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2595181 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2595182 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2595183 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2595184 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2595185 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2595186 we definitely do shopping there are some great little boutiques and restaurants we like going down by the river and we like the little shops by the beach and we go out to dinner most nights
2595187 people farmed rice cucumber cantaloupe and all that sort of stuff
2595188 hes so good at camelias he could tell you the variety of the camelias just by feeling the leaves
2595189 well anytime you can make a living doing something thats it
2595190 if you just sit down and let him talk hell entertain the dickens out of you
2595191 maybe youll have many more and youre an inspiration to all of us to get to be 100 if they can live like you
2595192 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2595193 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2595194 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2595195 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2595196 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2595197 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2595198 what if twenty years later imagining there was a president dukakis charles p pierce avoided the ludicrous level of veneration he espoused in a 2003 profile of senator ted kennedy
2595199 if this were anyplace else and any other time bernie
2595200 i looked silly in a tank for 15 minutes george bush has been in the tank for 30 years
2595201 if she had lived mary jo kopechne would be 62 years old through his tireless work as a legislator edward kennedy would have brought comfort to her in her old age
2595202 and thats the key thats how you survive what hes survived thats how you move forward one step after another even though your name is edward moore kennedy you work always as though your name were edward moore if she had lived mary jo kopechne would be 62 years old through his tireless work as a legislator edward kennedy would have brought comfort to her in her old age
2595203 after 40 years in the u s senate edward m kennedy has transcended the family mythology and become his own man
2595204 if she had lived mary jo kopechne would be 62 years old through his tireless work as a legislator edward kennedy would have brought comfort to her in her old age
2595205 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

2595209 deb and i are out for good i wish you and the fort the best of luck
2595210 i think they found that trying to play a close hand role in ticonderoga from wyoming or a house in the south of france or on a yacht in the middle of the atlantic ocean was very very difficult
2595211 says hes a democrat i dont know what his concept of democracy is but to me this is not democracy
2595212 president hugo chavez did not create the disqualifications against the opposition
2595213 one way or another these laws need to be approved
2595214 reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
2595215 mrs toguchi prayers are nice and its probably very helpful but you still need chemotherapy
2595216 dear lord youre the one who created my body so i know you can fix it
2595217 i put my whole faith in you father damien please pray for me too because i need your help
2595218 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2595219 the point here is that the primary tumor was treated
2595220 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2595221 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true skeptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer
2595222 im not the praying type but i just wanted to say thank you
2595223 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2595224 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2595225 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2595226 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2595227 a term descriptive of multicoloured mixtures or layered foods desserts salads ice creams etc
2595228 a mixture of two drinks in almost equal quantities the french term can mean a mixture of coffee and alcohol but the english term is usually used to describe a mixture of draught beer and lemonade or ginger beer
2595229 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2595230 a memorandum of understanding was reached between syria and the iaea that stipulated a visit exclusively to the kibar site and for one time only
2595231 syria has honored this and affirmed that if the agency had any queries after the visit it could present them to the syrian side to answer
2595232 syria did not work on setting up a nuclear reactor with the korean democratic republic or any other country
2595233 war is never a good thing no one wants it

2595237 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2595238 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2595239 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear
2595240 i believe he can recommend charges or action be taken against the police as a whole as well as individual officers
2595241 the early stages of the investigation led by detectives in portimao really were very poor
2595242 a number of people had touched the window and entered madeleines and the twins room prior to the arrival of the gnr local police
2595243 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2595244 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2595245 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2595246 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2595247 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2595248 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2595249 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2595250 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2595251 there were times in practice today i wondered if i made the right move
2595252 users must enter a username and password to use this computer
2595253 trying to get the protester out was quite noisy it sounded like they were in a bit of trouble but youve got to forget about that and carry on i dont think it affected him
2595254 with the stage his horse is at it was more than what could be expected
2595255 the man is a real machine hes been working nutting it out and getting everything into detail he didnt throw away any marks at all in there
2595256 well if theyre going to create them with toys anyway might as well let them have real toy ones
2595257 what do you guys do on the road to keep busy
2595258 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2595259 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2595260 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2595261 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here

2595300 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
2595301 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
2595302 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
2595303 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
2595304 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
2595305 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
2595306 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
2595307 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
2595308 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
2595309 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
2595310 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
2595311 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
2595312 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
2595313 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
2595314 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
2595315 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
2595316 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
2595317 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
2595318 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
2595319 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2595320 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
2595321 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2595322 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up
2595323 the religious sense of life has to do with exposing oneself to the radical uncertainty and the open endedness of life which is meaning giving salt giving risk taking religion on my telling is a pact or covenant with the impossible to have a religious sense of life is to long with a restless heart for a reality beyond reality to tremble with the possibility of the impossible

2595326 unlike standard diplomacy which might be described as the ways in which government leaders communicate with each other at the highest level public diplomacy focuses on the way in which a country acting deliberately or inadvertently through both officials and private individuals and institutions communicates with citizens in other societies but like standard diplomacy it starts from the premise that dialogue rather than sales pitch is often central to achieving the goals of foreign policy to be effective public diplomacy must be seen as two way street it involves not only shaping the message s that a country wishes to present abroad but also analyzing and understanding the ways that the message is interpreted by diverse societies and developing tools of listening and conversation as well as the tools of persuasion
2595327 our ambassador needs to have the steel and tactful wit to take on the lttes finest advocates and enablers such as lawyer bruce fein without cowering behind slander articles of the defense ministry web site and kept press which is the current governments strategy
2595328 of grave violation of human rights humanitarian laws and crimes against tamils
2595329 writing about the flagrantly defamatory article you published on sunday september 9 2007 entitled what diplomats and ex diplomats do to their country the said article maliciously and falsely asserted or implied that my client was a traitor to his country or unpatriotic
2595330 a second tamils for justice tfj objective is statehood none of my doubters have either read or written even a microscopic fraction of what i have read or written about natural law morality and modern practice to justify a right to statehood i have previously advocated statehood for kashmir and the turkish republic of northern cyprus the gruesome deterioration of the circumstances in sri lanka since my 2004 washington times article establishes the tamil case for statehood more strongly than the american colonial demand for independence from britain in 1776
2595331 the tamil right to statehood is on much firmer legal moral or historical grounds than east timor montenegro eritrea the slovak republic bosnia kosovo bangladesh and a host of other new or would be new nations nothing in 2004 the washington times article undercuts the tamil statehood entitlement in 2008
2595332 steel and tactful wit to take on the lttes finest advocates and enablers such as lawyer bruce fein
2595333 having lived in this country for many years i have a relative advantage in being able to understand washington and present the sri lanka case
2595334 the terrorist attack of september 11 2001 brought the tamil tigers to the bargaining table their sources of funding from the tamil diaspora dried up after 9 11 there was also an element of fatigue after 20 years of fighting and 60 000 killed they had been asking for a separate state but theyve now agreed that they would settle for a federal system of government
2595335 they have been fighting for almost 20 years and getting nowhere a lot of this had to do with fatigue and a realization since 9 11 that this is no no
2595336 in a startling revelation the position of counselor for public affairs in the washington embassy despite occupied by an outgoing and experienced public affairs personnel is being degraded to a level of a clerk whose responsibilities are usurped making its public affairs and public diplomacy program a non starter
2595337 asian tribune also reminded mr bandara that in fact the ltte momentum has gathered referring to news reports of its political leader s paramu tamilselvan led delegation touring on a public diplomacy mission in scandinavian european and other countries when he said that the tiger outfit has lost its momentum
2595338 if the tiger activities are on a downward trend according to mr bandaras understanding asian tribune is at a loss to know a tiger front organization which the sri lanka embassy had no interest to find out strategically organized congressman davis tour to the tiger land
2595339 of course peace also requires the full and frank participation of the ltte and let me leave no doubt my nation stands firm in the resolve that the tactics of terror can never achieve legitimate aspirations so the united states is greatly encouraged that the ltte has made a commitment to the political solution it has agreed to settle this conflict through peaceful means
2595340 it is christians and muslims and buddhists and hindus we have a mix of religious and ethnic tensions
2595341 the relationship between congressman brad sherman and the san fernando valley tro comes to the focus again in the wake of tsunami sherman like several other us leaders urged americans to make donations to the victims of the disaster with reference that while others steered donors towards established charities such as red cross he gave the number one spot to the tro in a press release dated january 7 2005 sherman provided a list of groups collecting donations the first group of the list was the tamil rehabilitation organization in addition to providing the tro with huge mileage by his endorsement congressman sherman reveals his awareness of the existence of the tro office and its location which in turn points to the fact that the lawmaker was endorsing the very group that was regularly trickling money into his campaign
2595342 rabid left wing liberal democrats in the u s congress are easily susceptible to the fairytales distortions misinterpretations fantasies and slanders of the tamil tiger professionals domiciled in the united states in the absence or lethargy of those who are in public diplomacy in sri lankas foreign ministry
2595343 president rajapaksa has been faulted by many of his apparent belief that the ltte is the chief source of the countrys ethnic strife and that only their military defeat would open the space in which to effectively address tamil grievances rather many analysts content the tigers are only one manifest aspect of a greater ethnic problem

2595377 all of christian theology points toward an end an end where jesus overcomes the satanic reign of death and restores gods original creation order
2595378 in scripture the eschaton is not simply tacked on to the gospel at the end it is instead the vision toward which all of scripture is pointing and the vision that grounds the hope of the gathered church and the individual believer in the face of death we see faith hope and love this is what we mean when we speak of christian eschatology the study of the last things or ultimate matters
2595379 and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come

2595410 vincer obama perch lamerica ha bisogno di cambiare la sua amministrazione e poi lo vuole il resto del mondo
2595411 vero risponde joseph ma obama pu contare su uno staff molto organizzato che ha raccolto grosse quantit di denaro che se utilizzato nella maniera dovuta in grado di modificare la scelta di alcune zone del paese storicamente di impronta republicana perch il nostro paese sente il bisogno di cambiamento anche se purtroppo il mio migliore amico voter mc cain

2595415 ricordo che durante le primarie con mia grande sorpresa molti miei conoscenti soprattutto donne non si fidavano affatto di obama lo giudicavano inesperto e gli preferivano hillary clinton

2595440 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2595441 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2595442 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2595443 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2595444 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2595445 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2595446 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2595447 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2595448 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2595449 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2595450 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2595451 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2595452 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2595453 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope

2595457 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2595458 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2595459 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

2595467 entonces llam a los doce y comenz a enviarlos de dos en dos les daba autoridad sobre los esp ritus inmundos les mand que no llevasen nada para el camino ni pan ni bolsa ni dinero en el cinto sino solamente un bast n pero que calzasen sandalias y que no vistiesen dos t nicas y les dec a dondequiera que entr is en una casa posada en ella hasta que salg is de aquel lugar cualquier lugar que no os reciba ni os oiga saliendo de all sacudid el polvo que est debajo de vuestros pies para testimonio contra ellos entonces ellos salieron y predicaron que la gente se arrepintiese echaban fuera muchos demonios y ung an con aceite a muchos enfermos y los sanaban
2595468 no ni siquiera vay is a casa a prepararos id tal y como est is no pens is en hacer ning n preparativo no os llev is comida no llev is dinero para comprar comida ni siquiera llev is escondida ninguna provisi n secreta en vuestra cartera en caso de emergencia salid confiando totalmente en dios y el suplir vuestras necesidades
2595469 cuando os envi sin bolsa sin alforja y sin calzado os falt algo ellos dijeron nada entonces les dijo pues ahora el que tiene bolsa t mela y tambi n la alforja y el que no tiene espada venda su manto y compre una
2595470 echaban fuera muchos demonios y ung an con aceite a muchos enfermos y los sanaban
2595471 est enfermo alguno de vosotros que llame a los ancianos de la iglesia y que oren por l ungi ndole con aceite en el nombre del se or y la oraci n de fe dar salud al enfermo y el se or lo levantar y si ha cometido pecados le ser n perdonados
2595472 el rey herodes oy de jes s porque su nombre hab a llegado a ser muy conocido
2595473 juan el bautista ha resucitado de los muertos y por esta raz n operan estos poderes en l otros dec an es el as mientras otros dec an es profeta como uno de los profetas pero cuando herodes oy esto dijo juan a quien yo decapit ha resucitado
2595474 es juan el bautista que ha resucitado de los muertos
2595475 oh oh es juan que ha resucitado otra vez de los muertos
2595476 porque herodes mismo hab a mandado prender a juan y lo hab a encadenado en la c rcel por causa de herod a la mujer de su hermano felipe porque se hab a casado con ella pues juan le dec a a herodes no te es l cito tener la mujer de tu hermano
2595477 p deme lo que quieras y yo te lo dar
2595478 le jur mucho todo lo que me pidas te dar hasta la mitad de mi reino ella sali y dijo a su madre qu pedir y sta dijo la cabeza de juan el bautista en seguida ella entr con prisa al rey y le pidi diciendo quiero que ahora mismo me des en un plato la cabeza de juan el bautista el rey se entristeci mucho pero a causa del juramento y de los que estaban a la mesa no quiso rechazarla inmediatamente envi el rey a uno de la guardia y mand que fuese tra da su cabeza en un plato la dio a la muchacha y la muchacha se la dio a su madre cuando los disc pulos oyeron esto fueron y tomaron su cuerpo y lo pusieron en un sepulcro
2595479 los ap stoles se reunieron con jes s y le contaron todo lo que hab an hecho y lo que hab an ense ado el les dijo venid vosotros aparte a un lugar desierto y descansad un poco porque eran muchos los que iban y ven an y ni siquiera ten an oportunidad para comer
2595480 sin embargo no os regocij is de esto de que los esp ritus se os sujeten sino regocijaos de que vuestros nombres est n inscritos en los cielos
2595481 f jate en esto todas estas personas creen que eres un gran maestro de la biblia
2595482 y se fueron solos en la barca a un lugar desierto pero muchos les vieron ir y les reconocieron y corrieron all a pie de todas las ciudades y llegaron antes que ellos cuando jes s sali vio una gran multitud y tuvo compasi n de ellos porque eran como ovejas que no ten an pastor entonces comenz a ense arles muchas cosas
2595483 es que no pod is dejarnos un rato en paz tenemos que tener tiempo para descansar es qu no os preocup is por nosotros
2595484 el que tenga hambre y sed de justicia ser saciado
2595485 como la hora era ya avanzada sus disc pulos se acercaron a l y le dijeron el lugar es desierto y la hora avanzada desp delos para que vayan a los campos y aldeas de alrededor y compren para s algo de comer el les respondi y dijo dadles vosotros de comer le dijeron que vayamos y compremos pan por doscientos denarios y les demos de comer el les dijo cu ntos panes ten is id y vedlo eso pas cuando andr s encontr al muchacho que llevaba su comida consigo al enterarse le dijeron cinco y dos pescados el les mand que hiciesen recostar a todos por grupos sobre la hierba verde se recostaron por grupos de cien en cien y de cincuenta en cincuenta
2595486 todos comieron y se saciaron y recogieron doce canastas llenas de los pedazos de pan y de los pescados y los que comieron los panes eran como cinco mil hombres
2595487 en seguida oblig a sus disc pulos a subir en la barca para ir delante de l a betsaida en la otra orilla mientras l desped a a la multitud y habi ndose despedido de ellos se fue al monte a orar al caer la noche la barca estaba en medio del mar y l solo en tierra viendo que ellos se fatigaban remando porque el viento les era contrario a eso de la cuarta vigilia de la noche l fue a ellos caminando sobre el mar y quer a pasarlos de largo pero cuando ellos vieron que l caminaba sobre el mar pensaron que era un fantasma y clamaron a gritos porque todos le vieron y se turbaron pero en seguida habl con ellos y les dijo tened nimo yo soy no tem is y subi a ellos en la barca y se calm el viento ellos estaban sumamente perplejos pues a n no hab an comprendido lo de los panes m s bien sus corazones estaban endurecidos
2595488 eso que veis que tanto os asusta soy yo no os asust is
2595489 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2595490 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2595491 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2595492 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2595493 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2595494 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2595495 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2595496 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2595497 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2595498 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2595499 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2595500 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2595501 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2595502 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2595503 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2595504 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2595505 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2595506 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2595507 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2595508 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2595509 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2595510 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2595511 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2595512 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2595513 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2595514 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2595515 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2595516 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2595517 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2595518 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2595519 por m s amigo que sea en alg n momento te va a mirar la cola
2595520 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2595521 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2595522 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2595523 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2595524 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2595525 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2595526 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2595527 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2595528 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2595529 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2595530 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2595531 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2595532 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2595533 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2595534 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2595535 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2595536 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2595537 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2595538 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2595539 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2595540 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2595541 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2595542 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2595543 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2595544 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2595545 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2595546 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2595547 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2595548 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2595549 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2595550 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2595551 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2595552 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2595553 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2595554 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2595555 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2595556 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2595557 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2595558 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2595559 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2595560 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2595561 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2595562 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2595563 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2595564 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2595565 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2595566 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2595567 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2595568 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2595569 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2595570 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2595571 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2595572 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2595573 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2595574 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2595575 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2595576 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2595577 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2595578 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2595579 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2595580 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2595581 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2595582 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2595583 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2595584 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2595585 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2595586 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2595587 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2595588 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2595589 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2595590 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2595591 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2595592 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2595593 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2595594 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2595595 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2595596 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2595597 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2595598 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2595599 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2595600 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2595601 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2595602 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2595603 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2595604 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2595605 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2595606 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2595607 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2595608 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2595609 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2595610 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2595611 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2595612 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2595613 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2595614 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2595615 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2595616 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2595617 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2595618 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place

2595620 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2595621 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2595622 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2595623 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2595624 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2595625 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm

2595646 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2595647 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2595648 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling

2595656 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself

2595658 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2595659 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary

2595661 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2595662 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2595663 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2595664 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2595665 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2595666 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2595667 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2595668 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2595669 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2595670 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2595671 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2595672 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2595673 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2595674 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2595675 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2595676 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2595677 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2595678 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2595679 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2595680 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2595681 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2595682 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2595683 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2595684 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2595685 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2595686 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2595687 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2595688 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2595689 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2595690 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2595691 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2595692 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2595693 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2595694 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2595695 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2595696 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2595697 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2595698 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2595699 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2595700 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2595701 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2595702 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2595703 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2595704 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2595705 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2595706 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
2595707 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
2595708 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2595709 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2595710 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
2595711 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2595712 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to

2595718 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her privacy now or in the future
2595719 the escapist sets things up nicely its got a natural sound because it was made with live instruments i guess its spiritual in a pragmatic way im trying not to mention modern life i dont want to start sounding like some guru but it definitely reflects a change in my mental state
2595720 theres been a lag between the dip in the economy and us feeling it
2595721 i think we have a future as a public service broadcaster provided we can get ofcom and the government to realise very very quickly that we cannot afford to pay more than the licence and the psb public service broadcaster status is worth
2595722 its time for grade to go itv should be looking for a media mogul as opposed to someone who has ruined itv and overpaid himself
2595723 a lot of it is down to the economic environment when they set out their five year plan i dont think anyone would have anticipated the tv advertising market would have deteriorated to such an extent the target that he set was based upon the assumption that the tv ad market would grow by 3 to 5 per year obviously given the economic outlook thats now looking extremely unlikely
2595724 itv doesnt need the massive upheaval if michael grade was to go
2595725 the results arent fantastic but some of that is clearly macro
2595726 people will point towards failures like the palace but if you look at total volumes of impact it has actually done relatively okay
2595727 online what has really hit them is the kangaroo joint venture being referred to the competition commission which has set them back at least six months i dont think theres anyone who could be doing a better job at itv than grade the audience share itv is getting is increasing for the first time in decades
2595728 we had always forecast that the original ones were optimistic and these ones do seem more obtainable
2595729 what is going on at the moment is largely a cyclical phenomenon if you look at what is happening in other media and if you look at historical charts its not actually so surprising if you look at what is happening with the digital channels as the remaining analogue viewers switch over itv could disproportionately benefit from that

2595754 for the life of me i cant image that being a proportionate response to the charge that georgia has attacked russian peacekeepers
2595755 its hard for us to understand what russias plan is here
2595756 i do sense an emerging unified view among our key allies
2595757 towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict
2595758 we think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction

2595760 the prime minister is very focused on what we need to do to recapture peoples enthusiasm so when he comes back from his holidays will set out very clearly what he intends to do

2595772 liberals wonder why they are parodied as out of touch secularists who mix near total ignorance of traditional christianity with a seething idiotic attempt
2595773 i would immediately signal a long term desire to replace the council tax
2595774 while people are paying so much of their monthly income in council tax in comparison to their mortgage or income tax they feel as though the system is not working for them
2595775 thats largely a product of the way the tax has developed over the years the way that revaluations have not taken place
2595776 in the meantime i would press for water rates to be removed for pensioners and secondly redirect the resources the snp has set aside for the flawed local income tax and invest that for reducing council tax bills
2595777 we need to return to burt build a consensus inside and outside the parliament and work with local government on how we respond to abolition of the council tax and what we replace it with
2595778 as the primary store is slow and noticeably degrades performance

2595788 we have unrealistic expectations for people john edwards like the rest of us is only human
2595789 the truth is a lot of ordinary average americans have affairs
2595790 the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2595791 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2595792 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention
2595793 i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2595794 there are people who feel let down when you invest that much time and energy in a candidate and the candidate turns out to be less than you thought

2595796 it is difficult to see how the most militarily powerful country in the middle east is threatened by a poem

2595802 the authors devote a chapter to the politics and ethics of research the third major element being technique varieties of which receive a more balanced treatment than in the other works reviewed here quantitative methods are reviewed in a way which even the non numerate could understand the chapter on finishing and writing up research contains several ideas including mind mapping worthy of a more extended treatment an accessible relaxed style enables the authors to deal with issues that are intellectually demanding and at times controversial encouraging the researcher to develop a self reflexive capacity to manage research as both personal and public learning
2595803 i believe this book should be required reading for anyone embarking on research it introduces a broad range of issues relating to a successful research outcome the style of writing and the way the book is laid out make it very easy to read besides which the sections deliver pinsharp discussion of the minutiae of the techniques evaluation and analysis of the two methods
2595804 in addressing issues implicit in their assumptions the authors cover a wide range of research methods and techniques provide extensive references and numerous examples
2595805 a very clear and accessible introduction to the principles and practice of management research
2595806 as an introduction to management research this book is on balance and welcomed for the newcomer to the area it provides a reasonable starting stage the newcomer can use it to locate further more detailed sources on various aspects of research for the experienced researcher it is useful as a source to skim through to see if novel techniques or theoretical perspectives exist and where to look for more information on them
2595807 a lucid introduction to management research i will be recommending the book to graduate researchers at masters and doctoral level it is a book that deserves to succeed for its honesty clarity and common sense
2595808 a compelling exposition of how authors printers booksellers and readers competed for power over the printed page
2595809 a mammoth and stimulating account of the place of print in the history of knowledge
2595810 a detailed engrossing and genuinely eye opening account of the formative stages of the print culture
2595811 the most lucid and persuasive account of the new kind of knowledge produced by print
2595812 developing nationals and giving them access to state of the art educational knowledge is a top priority for aldar and an integral part of its social responsibility we do hope this programme will contribute in the most effective way to the process of building the future business leaders for abu dhabi a process that stands at the core of aldar strategy
2595813 for the graduates it is a modular built into their 3 year program aimed at providing graduates with a tool box and motivation to succeed in the work place manage their careers and develop management and leadership capabilities which will fast track their career growth
2595814 we are very pleased to have this opportunity to work with aldar and their graduate and scholarship intake they are the future of the company and indeed the nation we are very privileged to have the partnering agreement with the royal military academy sandhurst which we have had since 2001 sandhurst provides a unique leaning environment and many transferable leadership skills its not about shouting orders but about knowing your people and understanding what makes them tick communicating clearly and effectively and developing a sense of selfless commitment to something larger than ourselves we look forward to working with the aldar graduates and watching them grow as leaders and individuals

2595827 you need to struggle from all of europe it is one world and we should all fight to keep it beautiful
2595828 with all the talk of carbon footprints and wind and solar energy we just cant see why they should be allowed to burn fossil fuel leave the coal in the ground
2595829 symbolically some people did get over the electric fence its sending out a powerful message this is democracy
2595830 im with them all the way theyve done a good job today
2595831 a new coal station here would be a climate disaster it could emit more greenhouse gases than heathrow airport
2595832 most did not get far but two reached the power station and the crew of one also got over the perimeter fence
2595833 it was a total success we stopped any coal getting to the station and disrupted its operation if the government gives the go ahead for a new plant we will be back to stop it this is not a symbolic protest
2595834 this protest is about raising awareness hopefully it will put pressure on government not to approve new coal plants
2595835 this is a police warning please disperse in 10 minutes or police horses dogs and police batons will be used

2595843 hi brian i too am from the security analysis background and i fully agree with
2595844 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2595845 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2595846 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2595847 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2595848 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2595849 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2595850 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2595851 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2595852 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2595853 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2595854 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2595855 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2595856 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2595857 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large

2595861 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2595862 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2595863 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2595864 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2595865 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2595866 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2595867 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2595868 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2595869 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2595870 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2595871 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2595872 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2595882 congo wants to preserve its protected spaces it needs the best expertise if that expertise comes from outside i dont see why we should be reticent we dont have any hang ups in that respect
2595883 im under no illusion over how difficult it is the glimmer of hope is that we have a very strong team of rangers on the ground
2595884 we are now seeing floods and landslides closing road and railways
2595885 this is just the kind of impact we will expect to see more of as the climate changes further
2595886 scotland has the potential to produce the best climate change legislation anywhere in the world setting the benchmark for the climate talks over the next 18 months
2595887 the snp have promised a lot but the detailed legislation will need to include all of the climate change gases and emissions from international aviation and shipping if it is to capture all of scotlands direct impact
2595888 that one might argue that they constitute little more than outdoor zoo populations
2595889 cannot be expected to expend funds indefinitely to maintain condors in nature
2595890 progress toward recovery is not sustainable under current conditions because reintroduction of more condors simply increases the costs required to keep wild birds alive
2595891 an extensive outreach effort to rally support for replacement of lead ammunition
2595892 poisoning from ingestion of spent ammunition in carcasses is so severe and chronic
2595893 that condor recovery cannot be achieved so long as such lead exposure continues
2595894 removing lead ammunition is not only right for condors it is right for other scavengers and it is right for hunters and their families
2595895 may be highly problematic california fish and game has done little to educate hunters and non lead ammunition is not readily available or identifiable in many retail outlets
2595896 unlikely to comply as long as lead bullets are easily purchased

2595898 20 years after i first testified before congress on the threats posed by climate change we have reached a point at which we must remove unnecessary carbon emissions from our lives or face catastrophic consequences it is hard to imagine waste more unnecessary than the 100 billion pieces of junk mail americans receive each year and these new findings revealing that the emissions of junk mail are equal to those of over nine million cars underscore the prudent necessity of a do not mail registry

2595902 victims whom i have met with continue to complain of headaches skin lesions nose throat and lung problems as well as digestive problems
2595903 i am very concerned about the situation especially for women who have complained of an increase in premature births early menopause and miscarriages since the dumping occurred
2595904 the people of abidjan need urgent assistance after two years they continue to live in precarious conditions and their right to a healthy and safe environment continues to be violated
2595905 some of the victims i met are the most vulnerable without enough money to eat let alone pay for expensive medical bills

2595936 when i said that you could beat the deputies into submission with your willy i didnt mean that you should it was a turn of phrase it suggested great strength and power it was meant only to raise our morale and utterly destroy theirs
2595937 but since you are the heir to the throne of spanx i thought that you were giving me a 116 royal decree under normal circumstances i would have used my paws and perhaps the nearest available table or window frame i never intended to utilize my most private of parts though you must agree as a cudgel substitute mi guillermo enorme era muy eficiente

2595942 thought you might have her youngling hidden in there i wondered if you were planning to sell it to the slave trading moles from the dreadful town of bloated gut itd be just like you
2595943 on your way cur youll get nothing from me tonight least of all a roll in a shallow road side ditch i would rather mate with my own esophagus
2595944 who dares utter a sound whilst i speak and who gives a fluff what sort of parasite anyway theyre all the same arent they
2595945 take the wasp for instance that might lay its eggs inside your body then later its larvae would eat you from the insides out are those the type of parasites to which you refer
2595946 now shut the fluff up i have something very important to announce
2595947 that particular nasty lives in your gut and starves you to death by consuming all your food after youve eaten it but before you can gain much sustenance from it and the only way to get rid of it is by pulling it from out of your arse hole is that the parasite to which you refer do you have a tape worm that youd like pulled from out of your arse you certainly appear both irritable and uncomfortable
2595948 ladies gentlehamsters and you lot of filthy scum behold your nemesis awaits our invitation
2595949 throw aside your hood to reveal your identity thereby stunning them all with the fact that someone in your exalted position should do my bidding then go amongst them and select those that ive had marked with a white cross upon their back and denounce them as stix then i can have them carried off into slavery for the wheel is it really that difficult you shaven headed nincompoop

2595951 now bugger off the lot of you remain out of trouble and stay incognito if you can just let the situation cool dont go antagonizing the law master so no trying to bust up the wheel for a while now get the fluff out before anyone comes back to witness the executions
2595952 if any of you happen to get recaptured you wont mention this little 126 episode the law master will have me slain in your places and theres loads of you
2595953 i say we corner the bastard on a dark alley and beat him to a pulp

2595962 the sale of glendronach is making good progress and we expect to complete the sale by september
2595963 the reality is its death by a thousand cuts and hes just said enough is enough
2595964 our retail background and my knowledge of what used to make oddbins great will help drive the passion and innovation back into this business
2595965 there will be a short period during which we review the current structure and develop plans for the future this is a cash positive business with plenty of stock great locations throughout the uk and passionate staff
2595966 he has been in the trade since birth and bleeds wine not blood
2595967 i liken it to ben amp jerrys ice cream a quirky business started by individuals which cut across every sensible business model and yet succeeded when ben amp jerrys was sold on to unilever some of that magic disappeared
2595968 we won a lot of awards over the years and were too busy patting ourselves on the back to see how much the supermarkets were improving their ranges
2595969 oddbins built its reputation finding new world wines today new world wine is everywhere and specificity has been lost of course we tried with greek wine and so on but there was no point of difference
2595970 the fact is even if oddbins had continued with its magic the market has moved on
2595971 this has been driven by the supermarkets determination to gain a bigger share of footfall and spend in the wine category whereas majestic successfully reacted oddbins didnt
2595972 the management team have to turn back five years and remind themselves what made the brand famous and successful and work out how they can recreate that
2595973 everyone wishes them well although tesco may not admit it im guessing they are quite pleased about this deal as it adds to the richness and excitement of wine retailing in the uk

2596014 we strongly believe it will provide benefits to all of the plants stakeholders and communities
2596015 the nations first stand alone publicly traded nuclear energy generating and marketing company
2596016 this restructuring is absolutely bad for vermont and vermont taxpayers are going to get screwed
2596017 capture the appeal of reliable nuclear power which is virtually emissions free and supports u s energy independence while preparing for future energy demands
2596018 describes nuclear powers role in the nexus between the worlds growing energy demand and the united states need for clean environmentally friendly power
2596019 the department cannot support the enexus corporate structure as proposed enexus as proposed would have far too much debt as well as limited resources to meet any capital expenses that may be required for continued operation
2596020 all this clearly indicates to policymakers in vermont that we should have no faith in the nrc to protect our interests we have to rely on ourselves to protect our interests
2596021 the nrc has been lockstep with entergy in general and with this plant in particular from the get go entergy is a big company accustomed with getting its way and it is having a meltdown over the fact that the little state of vermont has purview over this restructuring or a license extension
2596022 entergys plan is ill conceived on a number of levels it could ultimately cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars does nothing to guarantee adequate decontamination of the site and does not anticipate a future new york without indian point
2596023 if the spinoff of entergys nuclear plants is approved and based upon the structure of the spinoff entergy then tries to evade its obligations under the value sharing agreements nypa intends fully to protect its rights and challenge that unwarranted conduct in a court of law
2596024 with years of reckless undermining of economic and financial regulation now exposed in a series of catastrophic financial collapses investigators turning over rocks keep finding the same agents of decay demands for short term
2596025 during all those years health and safety regulation got the same debilitating treatment from congress and the presidency as its financial counterparts how long before those chickens come home to roost and where will the roosting be
2596026 entergy corporation was a pioneer in establishing separate corporate entities to own and operate nuclear power plants
2596027 the use of holding companies below entergy nuclear holding company allows entergy to segregate various types of financing investment and business activities and by doing so enables entergy to better manage and control risks associated with these activities
2596028 with the passage of two more decades renewed complacency has eroded these safeguards
2596029 the consolidation of nuclear ownership now risks the shifting of accident and decommissioning costs from the plant owners to the general public because the relatively secure financial backing of substantial utility companies has in many cases been replaced by a limited liability subsidiary whose only asset is an individual nuclear power plant
2596030 the limited liability structures being utilized are effective mechanisms for transferring profits to the parent owner while avoiding tax payments they also provide a financial shield for the parent owner if an accident equipment failure safety upgrade or unusual maintenance need at one particular plant creates a large unanticipated cost the parent owner can walk away by declaring bankruptcy for that separate entity without jeopardizing its other nuclear and non nuclear investments
2596031 would you agree with me that enexus is not as financially sound as entergy is today
2596032 thats a very difficult question to answer yes or no
2596033 well let me try to break it down for you is enexus going to be rated investment grade
2596034 sometimes in the winds of change we find our true direction

2596047 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2596048 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2596049 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2596050 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2596051 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2596052 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2596053 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2596054 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2596055 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2596056 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

2596068 es war keine kosmetische operation es war eine normale krankenkassenleistung die get tigt werden kann wenn die gefahr einer psychischen erkrankung besteht und dar ber gibt es bei meiner tochter ein gutachten

2596087 jade has been has been more than a decorative stone it has been the definitive metaphor for the very fabric of chinese culture an icon of excellence and virtue often described as the stone of heaven this historical connection to jade was somewhat obscured in the years of the tumultuous birth of the peoples republic but by the fitting decision to adorn the 2008 olympic gold medals with a jade inlay the connection has been jarred awake the decision was fitting because chinese tradition holds that an adornment of jade represents fine and noble excellence to be properly bestowed upon the worthiest of the worthy
2596088 there is an innate potency abiding within the heart of every fine piece of jade the emperors sunrise in particular radiates a positive energy that is fairly palpable any person who would visit the emperor as pratt calls it should look closely just above the centre on the polished face there one will see a tiny glowing eye from this eye emanates the power within the stone any who would touch it as long as their mind is open will at once be suffused with the dynamism from within if the supplicant be an olympic athlete they will go to their competition with an invincible connection to the gold they seek to all canadian athletes i say go to the emperor it is close by you in the heart of beijing touch the eye the power within will come upon you like a talisman carry it with you and do well in olympic competition

2596103 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2596104 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2596105 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2596106 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

2596109 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2596110 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2596111 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2596112 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2596113 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2596114 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2596115 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2596116 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2596117 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2596118 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2596119 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2596120 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

2596124 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2596125 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2596126 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2596127 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2596128 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2596129 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2596130 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2596131 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2596132 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

2596160 when you signed up for a paypal account you agreed to their terms which included not giving you over 500 before you registered a card with them yet you then complain when they try and hold you to it this is more another case of understanding what you are agreeing to before you sign or electronically sign whatever the case may be
2596161 they dont have an incentive to send you anything if you make it clear they wont get anything out of it
2596162 if you are afraid of somebody stealing your paypal account get a rsa security key

2596165 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2596166 the front loaded commission is attractive and there is a 12b 1 fee annual trailing commission paid to the broker as well
2596167 never put another penny in these funds but they dont look terrible if you are already in them and have paid the load
2596168 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

2596174 i can honestly say that since that first night when a tattered printed manuscript found its way to me thanks to one of my daughters my life has never been the same once you read it for yourself you will understand why
2596175 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2596176 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2596177 its been a big week for the footy club but tonight was an opportunity to make a statement
2596178 everyones been battered from pillar to post from the president through to the leadership group and i guess thats filtered through to the players
2596179 it was a really important game we were challenged a couple of times but the boys really stood up i just thought it was a collingwood we want to be a part of
2596180 the benefits of investing in collectables as an alternative asset class have never been clearer not only do rare stamps and historical signatures provide a means of diversification and a safe haven in difficult economic conditions but also provide a hedge against inflation
2596181 hopefully well get something done i have talked to plax and showed him our schedule and he knows the time left to prepare ourselves he knows and agrees that we dont want to break camp without him having gotten anything done

2596184 for the first time to my knowledge we have a specific brain association for people with a personality disorder
2596185 its new and different because its not a lesion or injury to the brain but it is a difference in perceiving information that comes from an interaction
2596186 its not just a matter of bad attitudes or a lack of will

2596188 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2596189 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2596190 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2596191 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2596192 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2596193 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2596194 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2596195 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2596196 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2596197 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2596198 hey i know this may seem kind of strange but i wanted to know if you like me

2596203 the whole truth nothing but the truth so help me mac
2596204 north ossetians have been strong supporters of the nationalists in south ossetia and the leaders of both regions have called for their unification as a republic in the russian federation
2596205 the ossetians an iranian speaking people are mainly sunni muslims in the north and eastern orthodox christians in the south where georgian culture prevails they are descended from the medieval alans
2596206 stalin whose father was reputed to be ossetian in 1922 divided control over ossetia between the georgian and russian soviet republics a move which angered ossetians and prompted occasional protests over subsequent decades
2596207 when the south ossetians attempted in 1989 to reunite with ethnic kin in russian controlled north ossetia the georgian nationalist zviad gamsakhurdia marched supporters into the region to confront the secessionists
2596208 as the kremlins hold over its empire crumbled the caucasus witnessed a surge in nationalism regions like chechnya declared independence from moscow but in south ossetia local leaders proclaimed their region part of the russian federation rather than the emergent sovereign state of georgia
2596209 sporadic clashes between georgians and south ossetians who had mostly lived together in peace for decades often inter marrying continued until 1991 when tbilisi sent in troops to crush the separatist movement more than 2 000 people are believed to have died in the fighting
2596210 the republic has not been immune to the turmoil in neighboring regions in 1992 after several days of fighting tens of thousands of ingush inhabitants of north prigorodny region once part of the checheno ingush assr and to be reincorporated into it under a 1991 soviet law fled or were expelled to the newly established republic of ingushetia
2596211 the city of beslan was the scene of a chechen ingush terrorist seizure of a middle school the siege ended violently with the death of more than 300 hostages
2596212 after a coup toppled mr gamsakhurdia as president his successor eduard shevardnadze agreed a deal with boris yeltsin for russian peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire when mikheil saakashvili ousted mr shevardnadze in the 2003 rose revolution he vowed to bring south ossetia and another breakaway region abkhazia back under tbilisis control
2596213 saakashvili accuses russia of sending cash and weapons to separatists in both regions to ensure continued kremlin influence in the oil rich caucasus the btc pipeline carrying oil from azerbaijan to turkey is routed through georgia and to undermine georgias bid to join nato russia has given passports to the vast majority of south ossetians and abkhazians and pledges to defend its citizens in those provinces many south ossetians say they expect other caucasian peoples to support their fight against georgia and reports are emerging of volunteers heading for the region from abkhazia and north ossetia
2596214 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2596215 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2596216 i am asthmatic and i used a preparation to treat myself not as a doping agent
2596217 in the 12 years i have been racing i have had an aut for a certain product syndicort my old aut which ran out on 29 may related to that medicine the next one related to another product becotide and that was what led to the positive result
2596218 i dont know if i was negligent or if it was due to the doctor

2596221 walking street we learn is the epicentre of the sex trade in pattaya its about a mile long and at night springs to life with neon signs thai people are generally conservative in their dress sense its generally considered provocative to bare your shoulders but on their street the girls are wearing very little and offering anything you can imagine for a price its easy to look around with human eyes see the depravity and get angry you see older men walking hand in hand with young girls as a daddy thats hard to take in its easy to get angry its easy to judge but thats not our job so we grit our teeth we were in pattaya to be part of a praise event not far from this street the soul purpose of which was to worship and show gods light in a dark place we wanted to play more than the scheduled slots while we were there so we found out that one of the bar owners would let us play a worship set in her bar on the proviso that we brought as many from the missions team who would buy coke a cola all night we walk in to the bar which is about the middle of walking street girls are lined up on the stairs waiting for business we get set up were really nervous and quite uncomfortable but we kick in to a familiar beat of worship and soon its ok god starts to speak and we started to move in to this spontaneous song the truth is when you worship in a place you start to see gods heart for that place what would god say to a place like this amidst the depravity god says im the god of this city im the king of these people and greater thing are yet to come greater things are still to be done here the song wasnt written before that night but we came out of the bar having worshipped with the song that is now the title track of our album god of this city greater things the song isnt just for pattaya its for your city and its true by faith we must expect that greater things are still to be done
2596222 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny

2596231 snowangel kiss me again like you did the first time
2596232 i think i should go i have to take something to my friend
2596233 i want you to stay all night stay forever if you could
2596234 if you dont know why then i dont have to tell you find out on your own
2596235 i havent done something today that i should have done
2596236 i really hate it when people judge you based on your past life and convictions how many freakin times supercr3w spinned on their heads or flip over each other
2596237 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2596238 had no reason to be more optimistic today than we were yesterday
2596239 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2596240 i dont think there will be any continuation of discussions on the statement the positions are too far apart
2596241 the pullout of georgian troops is the most important thing
2596242 to go as soon as possible to the region to propose to the parties concerned some elements to get out of the crisis
2596243 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia the re establishment of the situation that existed before
2596244 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2596245 the future world order is to be decided today in georgia
2596246 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to us 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action
2596247 what we see here is not just a confrontation of minor republics but probably the confrontation between i am sorry to say that moscow and the entire west because now russia is basically protecting its clients and its own citizens up to 80 per cent of south ossetian population have russian passports
2596248 german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier was trying to solve the abkhazian conflict he proposed money to be allocated in the west in order to rebuild the infrastructure of this separatist republic but it didnt work because sides do not accept european mediators any more thats because the eu is politically too weak in the caucasus the eu has no real economic interests in the region and it has no armed forces there it failed in the past 16 years to develop some kind of co operation with russia and georgia or to join the peacekeeping missions in the region
2596249 several russian peacekeepers have been killed and that has greatly increased the stakes in the conflict because a few weeks ago president medvedev personally called mikhail saakashvili and asked him to refrain from using force against russian peacekeepers and the worst has happened the georgians killed russian peacekeepers in south ossetia and it is an attack not only against south ossetia its an attack against russia
2596250 be leader of stability and security on the entire territory of the former ussr
2596251 global ideological confrontation has been replaced by a struggle for spheres of interest in geopolitics
2596252 it is extremely important that all those involved show restraint and play their part in bringing about a political solution
2596253 it is important that the parties in conflict quickly start to communicate so as to put an end to the use of violence
2596254 for the georgian people this is really a sign of strong solidarity with them
2596255 its one thing to know it its another thing to see it
2596256 the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia must be respected
2596257 only the russian media and one ukrainian channel have been filming in the breakaway republic no western camera crews have been working in the conflict zone
2596258 the president of the united states and putin discussed the situation
2596259 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2596260 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2596261 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2596262 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2596263 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2596264 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2596265 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2596266 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2596267 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2596268 weve pretty much given up on the idea of issuing any kind of statement at this point
2596269 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2596270 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2596271 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
2596272 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2596273 nobody ever will defy russian rule in this part of the world
2596274 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia and the re establishment of the situation that existed before
2596275 this is a 100 per cent unprovoked brutal russian invasion and aggression into a sovereign country

2596304 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space
2596305 we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace
2596306 all of a sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
2596307 africa has the most genetic diversity in the world but it is one of the least studied places
2596308 ive always felt like there were a lot of stories there that nobodys had the time or interest to look into
2596309 the family tree of the y chromosome is very very clear
2596310 i like the fact that the linguistic genetic and archaeological evidence all line up
2596311 when you see lines of evidence converge on a single model it means thats probably something that actually happened
2596312 uh oh someone washed their hands doctors wash their hands nicole is the mole

2596316 theyre still trying to put sponsorship together for the 40 cup car but i dont know what will happen there
2596317 right now its just about these nationwide races as far as next year i really i dont know i dont know if ill be racing in nascar or whether ill be racing in another series somewhere
2596318 it definitely wasnt ideal and its not a good feeling

2596323 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2596324 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2596325 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2596326 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2596327 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2596328 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2596329 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2596330 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2596331 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2596340 the kings grandsons birth is so hard for you to bear
2596341 the son of the moon sits ill at your suggestion
2596342 speak ill again of me or my family and ill see you tongue cut out and dried in the market you old whore
2596343 we just barely made it out of the gate with our skins as it is
2596344 and worse the moon god has spoken to me again in my dreams the path to the lands by the sea will not open for us and the foreign warriors upon it will crush us as they seek the city gate of triumph
2596345 my lord it is as i have said you must take a new wife a wife of old blood without her you will not find the path that will lead us to freedom in the sea lands you must go back and not return to the camp until you have secured her
2596346 aga you know i cannot my liver will not bear the hardship and suffering of such loss once more it will break in sorrow first
2596347 you know we all believe in your rulership your vision you do not turn your face from the gods will your liver is pure and kind and your line is strong
2596348 your flocks are thick as lice upon an ass you have married your older sons to black headed daughters your daughters to black headed princes those that remain are filled with love for you and know you will yet make great futures and fortunes for them none of us blame you for speaking out for the common people for risking your lands and titles in this dark time of turmoil and coming war we know you are right we believe with you that the city will yet fall the akkadian line has brought the disfavor of the gods to the land of the two rivers and they have blown their divine breath hard upon your neck we feel it too
2596349 have faith great lord the gods will not allow you to fail in your quest should you but follow their will
2596350 i will nourish myself with some date beer and kid flesh and i will go may humbaba take you if you turn out to be wrong aga
2596351 lali how many times do i have to tell you you are not to let the merchants of the old line leave without my knowledge let any of the rabble and for the love of the moon god any of the long stinking akkadian trash yes but we need the merchants damn your eyes did i not give you the tablet of those forbidden to leave with my very own hands
2596352 i am your slave my will is one with yours this you have long known since i was dedicated into your service many nights we have lain together many vile akkadian plans we have thwarted our two heads have saved many pure blood families all that i am is devoted to you not even pazuzu himself could turn me from my path
2596353 but enki tickled me with his divine reed and made me to know that ibrahim of the lower gate street was one who must be allowed to leave
2596354 your tears are mine that for all we have done we could not save him nor his place at court
2596355 you me all of the priestesses of the old line all of the loyal families hear the thoughts that enki and inanna gave me this day ibrahim will return and in doing so he will work the will of the gods i cannot say to what end but i can feel it i know it
2596356 this i swear to you it was given to me to know this by the goddess of war herself on all that is holy i tell you i made the right choice
2596357 i must partake in the deep ritual of sacred instruments of the skin drum of blood
2596358 do not let a demon of misunderstanding put filth in your ears
2596359 bring me two large cloaks with hoods make sure the wool of them is dyed a dark color
2596360 is the brothel of the two snakes still open i know its late
2596361 yes master your fourth son was there at this hour just two days ago when he met the merchant from dilmun for a beer and the company of a couple of priestess whores
2596362 that is good you may have a cup of beer tonight for your service
2596363 babu do not tell anyone that i am leaving do you hear not my sons not my wives counsel the other slaves to silence as well they must not be placed in jeopardy i alone will take this chance at displeasing the court
2596364 run over to the entrance of the near gate and give this to a man who will be waiting there he will have a red sash around his traveling robe
2596365 tis empty mlord and for a high one like you the gods own comfort may i bring you a beer and a woman to serve your needs
2596366 beer yes but no woman i will also want a screen will you erect one at once
2596367 mushallu may the gods bless you always my thanks for risking so much
2596368 what else could i do our families wouldve been forever entwined were it not for the ignorance of the prince and those fools he calls advisors indeed i think them twice demon spawn for forcing you to leave
2596369 there you have it wrong i was barely able to leave the city the princess herself had me on her list of merchants who were to remain in the city it was the hand of my own personal god that let me escape
2596370 so you see if i am to follow the vision my personal god has given me i must also bow to his will he will not give me succor of the liver but perhaps he will allow me to feel it filled with joy once more
2596371 do you know the woman was that much vision granted to you
2596372 no all i know is that she must come to me by the second day after the full moon so agas omens predicted where and how
2596373 do not worry ibrahim these are dark times but the gods show mercy to the just never doubt this
2596374 because she is the favorite of the gods my friend and her personal god is powerful and loves her black headed children
2596375 forever my family will remember your name and praise it to heaven
2596376 there is no time and we must leave at once i will explain to you as we ride for your camp it is two days from the city is it not
2596377 your family is safe and well the camp remains undisturbed and ready for your departure to the west when we return to it
2596378 i will fail all is lost i will fail all is lost
2596379 inanna has decreed it and all father an and enki have acceded to her the firebrand of heaven
2596380 the time of the black headed people is at an end
2596381 when we are destroyed in the north shall rise those who will ape our ways but not understand them they shall rename the gods forget the great art and nevermore will ritual magics protect and defend this land the age of iron and blood will begin
2596382 but not all is lost the gods have favored two of the black headed people above all others two who shall be honored with a great gift perhaps the greatest gift they have ever given to mortals since they gave the plant of immortality to ziusudra so many ages ago when he and his wife rode their ark upon the world at that time drowned by the wrath of the gods
2596383 i beg of you look about look at how the sun favors us with a gentle hand and how our flocks and herds thrive along the road my sons and daughters have heard your vision well as they have mine we are strong and time will pass quickly we will reach the land promised to us you will see
2596384 did you get the last of that soil off the bottom layer the one with that odd stone box i know yesterday you said youd have it cleared and the epigraphers are here if you want them to take a look at it
2596385 its even weirder i think its emesal the womans tongue
2596386 i think weve got something here something that will make the old man sorry he took that fancy copter out of here yesterday instead of toiling it out with us nobodies heh not nobodies for long i think
2596387 they had the sense to put all this stuff in this cave and seal it off so well

2596390 more than a handful of republicans along with him on issues such as campaign finance reform or immigration
2596391 i think nutting sees mccain more clearly than the worshippers on mccains press plane

2596411 the relationship with alternative technology presents us with a unique opportunity to address the needs of healthcare providers as they face tough legislation requiring that all patient data be secure
2596412 from what i know its a good piece of legislation but there could be some unintended consequences
2596413 im in a process right now with a small group of people
2596414 to really find out what is going on in the system
2596415 im committed 100 percent that this is going to be better
2596416 many times they felt theres some embarrassing situations that happen we need to find a way to make it more user friendly toward people with mental health problems
2596417 if it doesnt get through before the end of the term i really believe its something that would be re filed and by that time well have talked to most of the stakeholders and find out how we can make this happen
2596418 our goals have in large measure been met these are going to be treated as though theyre going to be regulations
2596419 if they would just quit bugging me for a while i could actually get some work done
2596420 i hope jim max comes over today hes always fun
2596421 our maintenance staff is working overtime this weekend to repair the elwha and troubleshoot the problem so that we can get this ferry back in service as soon as possible
2596422 we know that august is an awful time for this to happen in the san juan islands and we are working to minimize the impact as much as we can
2596423 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2596424 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2596425 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2596426 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2596427 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2596428 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2596429 to a drunken man the affairs of this world are like so much duck weed in a river
2596430 not only with the creed of hard work but with the almost religious understanding that only discipline and diligence brought reward
2596431 a teenaged boy who had just learned to drive entrusted with the care of a senator
2596432 i felt i could no longer be candid with my mother
2596433 the way working men and women have forsaken the very politicians who could help them most speaks of the primacy of emotion in politics
2596434 lady b asks me how the children are and adds to the table at large that i am a perfect mother
2596435 serena alleges that anonymous friend of hers goes out in the dark with extra layer of chalk white powder on her nose so as to be seen and resembles the dong with the luminous nose
2596436 i cant believe i had an attack how stupid why damn it
2596437 we were in a crisis situation and people told me that i needed to put him in a residential treatment center
2596438 basically what i found were a lot of web sites that were marketing web sites but nothing that was objective information about residential treatment centers
2596439 so youre in a crisis and youre looking at residential treatment and youre looking at 10 000 a month and youre thinking how in the name of god am i going to pay for this
2596440 there are charter schools and there are magnet schools the same thing is true for residential treatment centers its very important that you have a good match for both you and your child because the last thing you need is to continue to move that child
2596441 many people at this point do whats called a voluntary dependency and neglect they are basically charged with dependency and neglect they give their child back to the state or the county and then the county takes over the cost of the childs care
2596442 pretty much the parents are out of it at that point
2596443 they do it as long as they can and then they declare bankruptcy
2596444 these are children who have severe emotional disturbances and aggressive violent behavior
2596445 were trying to give the families enough breathing room and enough of a break so that they will continue to fight to maintain their family unit

2596459 i want to ask your advice about a publisher for my autobiography with which i have been tinkering for a year
2596460 whose are yours i feel murrays are the most reassuring
2596461 the misery i suffer at receiving a letter from your lordship without one word of that kindness which has made all the former ones so dear
2596462 theres just a general lethargy about the way these asylum seekers are treated which means no one gets exercised that theyre put in handcuffs taken on to planes and deported back to places where theyre going to die
2596463 the daily mail cant say asylum seeker without saying foreign criminal in the same sentence im sure its practically editorial policy
2596464 john steinbecks the grapes of wrath is a refugee novel just inter state the same hate remains
2596465 we looked as if wed been cobbled together in photoshop the three of us walking to my husbands funeral one white middle class mother one skinny black refugee girl and one small dark knight from gotham city it seemed as if wed been cut and pasted
2596466 we painted underpasses we did gardening litter picking all good fun and i was thinking of writing a book about it the last job of that summer was at campsfield house in oxfordshire now they call it an immigration removal centre at the time it was an asylum detention centre
2596467 for three days i was serving this inedible food to people whod come from somalia eritrea the congo from the balkans from war zones theyd fled for good reason i got talking with some of them and said why are you here why are you in prison its not illegal and yet we concentrate them in these places its a text book definition of a concentration camp the conditions are appalling i was shocked enough for that to be the end of my light comedy book of my amusing summers working as a labourer
2596468 so often what happens to these people is ridiculous to the point of laugh out loud funny
2596469 britain is proud of its tradition of providing a safe haven for people fleeting sic persecution and conflict
2596470 everyone at lastminute seems to go on to do what they really wanted to do
2596471 we all knew this was coming but none of my months of imagining the horror prepared me for the reality of it
2596472 they want you dead or alive so the terror will stop well i wouldnt know about that i mean rock roll didnt stop when elvis died on the khazi it just got worse
2596473 other people would do it if they were good enough
2596474 i would never have written either of the stories without having been a parent im a much better writer for being a father
2596475 you think well look ive changed your nappy ive taught you how to swim but all of that means nothing if youre going to grow up into a world that is callous and stupid i do this
2596476 this thing with being lovers it isnt like being married
2596477 to remain in the game one has to be considerate
2596478 youre choosing a philosophy its not about sex its not about marriage with sarah her unfaithfulness is just one of the symptoms of the fact that shes torn and is going to have to make this strong moral choice
2596479 the reason why i love people and writing about them is because they dont always respond with hate and anger if they did i wouldnt have a story to tell who wants to know about someone who was brutalised and became brutal im interested in the exceptions
2596480 if your face is swollen from the severe beatings of life smile and pretend to be a fat man

2596485 could george w bush and frederick kagan have possibly been right about the surge
2596486 i will see on the ground what is going to happen
2596487 it is good news if it is true if it happens it will reduce violence in the country a great deal
2596488 i dont think there is something called reconciliation and there will be no reconciliation as such
2596489 to me it is a very inaccurate term this is a struggle about power
2596490 he lost the second base job to alexei ramirez and uribe took it like a man he took it like a real pro and i was proud of him we gave him a chance to play a little third base and hes played great
2596491 since weve been winning a few here hes got a lot to do with it big hits big plays uribes a baseball player a lot of people ask why i protect uribe i say you watch this kid every day he is what he is i like the way hes playing
2596492 we think that we got enough offense from the first eight hitters to carry us
2596493 we need somebody to catch the ball and uribe has been doing an outstanding job
2596494 we know that he can play defense as a shortstop and a second baseman but hes playing a hell of a third base now and uribe was waiting for this opportunity he never pouted he was never mad he just kept working working and working
2596495 one thing about it all the work joey cora put with him in spring training and all of a sudden he came back here and we dont see that right now hes not there because i feel more comfortable in uribe catching the ball and not having more offense
2596496 we are in the process of expanding our production assembly and warehousing facilities due to years of continued strong growth our expansion will be sensitive to the environmental and sustainability concerns we believe that our green initiative is the responsible thing to do it fits well with our practice of using natural sustainable pure and non animal tested ingredients in our skincare formulations for the spa and beauty industry and also makes sound business sense the beauty and skincare product consumer of today demands natural and organic based formulations that are safe to put on the skin
2596497 cyprus is participating in the beijing olympiad in a spirit of fair play and at the same time is fighting for reunification peace and friendship for its people greek cypriots and turkish cypriots

2596499 our flag has been hoisted at the olympic village and this lifts our hearts because we are at a place where peace cooperation friendship and solidarity among people lauds and solidarity is what cyprus needs

2596502 i dont remember the number of women i have been with it might be over 200

2596504 when you know nothing can be done about a situation you stop thinking about it and when your mind is free you get the best sleep
2596505 the proceedings of the show went quite smoothly given the history of cold vibes between sallu and akki the combination of katrina with her real life hero and reel life hero was quite lethal but ultimately it all went off well minus a few hiccups sallu was his usual witty and sarcastic self akki took all the jibes in his stride and when he felt the time was right he made a few of his own at one point akki asked the host why dont you want to get married to your beautiful girlfriend kat salman who has never admitted to his relationship with kaif didnt like this public outing but kumar didnt stop here he went on to tell the host that he has a nice girl like kat and he should treat her properly then he added the final blow by saying kat was young and sallu was getting old he should think hard about settling down as one shouldnt be alone at his age

2596594 my idea of heaven tastes like a trevisana from fornino
2596595 then it was oh my god im going to be raped
2596596 with her faced pressed into the soil she couldnt shout for help and no one would have heard her anyway above the mobs taunts
2596597 i put myself out there equal to the boys i didnt want to be seen in any way as weaker
2596598 i dont want it out there for people to look at me and think hmmm this guy did that to her yuck i dont want to be viewed in my worst vulnerability
2596599 the feedback i got was mainly that women didnt want to be seen as special cases for fear that a it affected gender equality and b it hindered them getting assignments
2596600 the subject has been swept under the carpet its something people dont like to talk about
2596601 but there is one area where they differ from the boys sexual harassment and rape female reporters are targets in lawless places where guns are common and punishment rare
2596602 she knew how to guard against gropers dress modestly in jeans secured with a thick belt and take along a male companion all those preparations failed however
2596603 suddenly a good samaritan in the crowd pulled the photographer by the camera straps several yards to the feet of some policemen who had been watching the scene without intervening they sneered at her exposed chest but escorted her to safety

2596606 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2596607 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2596608 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2596609 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2596610 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2596611 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2596612 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2596613 hes the first one to really admit guilt so far as to be where theyre at
2596614 it started with his wife im glad he wont be wasting our money taxpayer money
2596615 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2596616 you dont forget it sadly a lot of people got hurt
2596617 we didnt expect that many we only had enough for 12
2596618 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2596619 i removed his pistol and put it in the back of my waistband
2596620 i felt so horrible the depth of evil i fell into
2596621 that whole thing then going gay that was a lie its not true we just had to come up with something it was a big fabrication it really bothers me
2596622 i dont want to hurt my in laws my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2596623 but i was a willing participant you can call it lust i really thought i would get off like a lot of people who are deluded

2596638 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2596639 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2596640 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2596641 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2596642 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2596643 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2596644 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2596645 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2596646 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2596647 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2596648 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2596649 looking down and shaking his head saying who are these fellows that are using my name so often in these debates

2596660 you couldnt beat him no one ever said one bad thing about him he was the same no matter when you saw him just happy go lucky
2596661 he was just one of those kinds of people he attracted everybody because he was always nice and friendly and considerate
2596662 and he was a good wal mart employee he would do anything for anybody who needed help
2596663 i never knew he even did this stuff until a few years back
2596664 i never got to see him do it but i know he loved it
2596665 hes probably glad to be in heaven because if anyone deserved to be in heaven tony would be it
2596666 i know he wasnt a real religious person he didnt go to church much but they really didnt make them better than tony

2596691 were just chipping away at a number of things weve got quite a few things to work on but i thought we executed pretty well
2596692 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2596693 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2596694 of course my heart skipped a beat hearing the news i get concerned but at the same time you just have to be smart and live your life
2596695 love is as much of an object as an obsession everybody wants it everybody seeks it but few ever achieve it those who do will cherish it be lost in it and among all will never never forget it
2596696 im aware that researchers from the university of southampton have applied to plant some gm poplar on our land were still considering their request but havent given a definitive answer
2596697 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of they way the reproduce theres a huge potential for cross pollination it could have a really negative impact and cause widespread ecological damage
2596698 distract from the real solutions that we all know we have our concern is that biofuels will distract people away from other solutions
2596699 its the long term environmental implications that we should be worried about
2596700 its difficult to predict what the long term consequences would be in the forests you have a vast number of species and a diverse ecosystem the trees last for a long time if something goes wrong the consequences are quite long term and significant
2596701 this is the way it is supposed to be cut the cake and toss the garter already

2596771 never assume that both of you want the same things in the same way at the same time like when youre going to have kids your careers and money
2596772 should we shift gears and go with the backup plan

2596778 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2596779 that seems like so long ago it seems like a dream
2596780 im not going to sit here and tell you that ive got this offense down that i know every guy in the locker room or they know me
2596781 its a routine and im just kind of following them thats different for me
2596782 i was really surprised that today i was as effective as i was and im not saying that that was good
2596783 im just saying i was able to take a snap call a play we were able to break a huddle and i was able to complete passes in some sort of rhythm
2596784 all the rumors about him throwing hard yeah theyre true
2596785 as soon as we stepped out here the stands are filled and it creates a new energy for the team
2596786 i came here as a kid and there were always a few people here and there but nothing like this
2596787 anytime you have a chance to get a guy like brett favre youve got to go get him
2596788 now with him theyre going to go at least 10 6
2596789 of course i and this team would come out being victorious
2596790 i hope at the end of this season i really do that i feel like i made the right decision i hope the jets fans and the people throughout the nfl world feel like i made the right decision at this point i think it was the right decision id love to win the super bowl i wouldve loved to have gone and won it last year as i said yesterday and the day before my intentions are to help this team win
2596791 how do you tell brett favre to adapt to you
2596792 hes trying to learn everybodys name trying to figure out where the cafeteria is and the dorm rooms and all that other stuff
2596793 theres nothing for me to do than try to get this offense down
2596794 get acclimated with the guys the system and that will take awhile and thatll be tough
2596795 im two weeks behind as far as practice and im also 38 years old so im a little bit behind there too
2596796 my arm feels fine itll be tired tomorrow and itll be sore because theres no substitute for getting into game type situations and putting the pads on

2596798 he never left behind the ones he made in high school

2596801 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2596802 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2596803 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2596804 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2596805 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2596806 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2596807 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2596808 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2596809 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2596810 can be defined in short the difficulty raised is the interpretation problem
2596811 in some cases taken from synergy view concludes that synergy between government and citizen action is based on complementary and embeddedness evans 1992 1995 1996 in woolcock and narayan
2596812 complementary refers to mutually supportive relations between public and private actors and is exemplified in legal frameworks embeddedness refers to the nature and extent of the ties connecting citizen and business group

2596816 essentially the postwar constitution and the local government act established the framework for a new decentralized central local relationship by providing for the direct popular election of governors my focus here is on whether as a result of direct election the prefectures character as intermediate bodies has change from being agents of the state to serving as intermediaries for both sides and specifically on what form this change may have taken
2596817 lord if you had been here you could have healed him hed still be alive but youre four days late and all hope is gone lord we dont understand why youve waited so long
2596818 your cosmetics should be just as pure as the food you eat because ultimately they both end up in the same place your body

2596821 we dont know what will happen but were talking about it now it will be the decision of the president of the country mikheil saakashvili
2596822 this deliberate strategy of aggression has grown into a full scale military intervention involving all regions of georgia
2596823 georgia calls upon the international community to make it clear to russia that intrusion into and bombing of the territory of a sovereign state is unacceptable in the 21st century and that such acts cannot and will not be tolerated
2596824 we can only bring the ideal of how sport can bring people together it is a very complex issue and it is not for the ioc to give a perspective on what has been happening
2596825 it is not what the world wants to see it is contrary to what the olympic ideal stands for the sad reality is that there are a number of countries at the olympics that are in conflict
2596826 were calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation in tibet
2596827 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2596828 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2596829 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this offseason
2596830 you see teams go out in free agency and spend on a lot of guys and everyone says oh theyre going to be great and go to the super bowl it takes chemistry and to me thats the most important thing you can have all the talent in the world but if the chemistry is not there it wont matter
2596831 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2596832 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2596833 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2596834 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2596835 he still has the utmost amount of respect from the guys in this locker room here and we wish him well wish him a good season and hope to see him in tampa
2596836 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2596837 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2596838 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2596839 i stay only moments because the factory is so far away as i kneel here talking to the lord this is kind a what i say
2596840 i just came again to tell you lord how happy ive been since we found each others friendship and you took away my sin dont know much of how to pray but i think about you everyday so jesus this is jim checking in today
2596841 i just came again to tell you lord how happy ive been since we found each others friendship and you took away my sin dont know much of how to pray but i think about you everyday so jesus this is me checking in today
2596842 the nurse is wrong she couldnt know that in here all the while everyday at noon hes here a dear friend of mine you see
2596843 she wishes to maintain her privacy and her daughters privacy
2596844 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2596845 be happy to participate in one i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
2596846 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2596847 she is a good and honest person the sweetest and most caring woman one could ever hope to meet
2596848 do you think its easy for us to just sit back and let everyone rip her to shreds and not defend her honor
2596849 it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what the picture is
2596850 i mean do you know how many pictures have been taken of me holding children in the last three years i mean it happens all the time
2596851 i think its amazing even as the mans coming clean that hes continuing to lie
2596852 just as ive been saying for 10 months that he had an affair with rielle hunter we know for a fact that is rielle hunters baby and that is him holding the baby in the beverly hilton hes not only hiding things from the public hes hiding things from his wife
2596853 we couldnt have been there at 3 in the morning if we didnt have a good pipeline into the whole situation
2596854 radio buttons to respond without having to scroll to those buttons just bugs the hell out of me but i generally put up with it i guess i should learn to be more tolerant in other areas as well
2596855 an hour with a book would have brought to your mind the secret that took the whole year to find
2596856 the cdc is committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
2596857 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
2596858 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2596859 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2596860 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2596861 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture
2596862 estuda a possibilidade de exportar o petr leo por meio do oleoduto baku novorossiysk mas sua capacidade bastante baixa
2596863 the seven bathrooms were ghastly colours and the wallpaper and decorations were of poor quality
2596864 id say weve spent about 100 000 euros and probably need to spend another 100 000 outside maybe the letting income will buy us a tennis court
2596865 we have tried to think what we could do to get rentals in spring and autumn
2596866 the chateau is in a region famous for its truffles foie gras and fine wines so we have enlisted the help of an experienced french speaking london chef guy wooley to conduct foody breaks
2596867 our first rental was disastrous and almost put us off
2596868 we used to think you could spend your way out of recession by boosting government spending
2596869 concrete and front loaded plans to bring debt back below the ceiling
2596870 we will always have the physical property but what has become apparent is that the same property skills are also relevant in the financial markets where the value of some kinds of investments is driven by the value of the underlying property
2596871 we have done enough trades that we now feel comfortable about using derivatives for larger commercial purposes we can use derivatives to do all sorts of things first to more effectively rebalance our portfolio but also hedge our exposure to developments and to control our capital exposure
2596872 when we do developments from now on we will always be looking at how property derivatives can help us what we are trying to do is be able to watch all the markets and be able to look out for opportunities
2596873 provided we are always using our property skills we will have an advantage
2596874 the combination of yield and accretion is expected to produce a very satisfactory return taking account of the risk of loss by default
2596875 we are looking at derivatives looking at cmbs and looking at the value that we may be able to generate by trading in listed securities
2596876 but its a mistake to link it to traditional bingo because thats a completely different proposition our women are young above average income and typical internet consumers land based bingo is about elderly people smoking and aggressive slot machines
2596877 people are cutting back on leisure but they are staying home and spending only in the low tens of pounds a month with the chance of winning some extra cash the beauty of it is there are very low costs and a huge number of players so despite low margins it is very profitable
2596878 you have the same aspects of community through the bingo chatroom but you can make a noise without being shushed by the old ladies play in your pyjamas and start a game at any time of day
2596879 there are so many free bonuses and prizes i feel sorry for land based bingo because its really suffering but online has so much more to offer
2596880 and it is really addictive i dont worry about it being fixed if you go to the big places
2596881 when online bingo was invented land based bingo feared the competition
2596882 now they have realised there is only a 10 per cent crossover of their players
2596883 people will start to value recognised online brands and recession might not be a bad thing as the me too brands wont stay the course
2596884 our growth has been seismic with more than 12 000 new customers a month
2596885 spending on a game is very low compared with other internet gambling but our customers feed into other areas of our business
2596886 not lending in loan or small overdraft to the hospitality sector
2596887 i cannot get the overdraft of an 18 year old out of them you could invent nylon and you couldnt get going
2596888 it is all wrong and the government ought to set up a central commercial bank that lends properly to business these developments from hsbc have far greater implications to the economy than any of the tinkerings that the chancellor might do to the economy this is serious stuff
2596889 we are still open for business we have tightened up our lending criteria in the leisure area and it will depend on individual circumstances we have to look at the prospects of all businesses and unfortunately this is a sector that has experienced some difficulties
2596890 sir it has rained every day since gordon brown became prime minister yours etc
2596891 i have them thanks to my children and now i can consider me a fan of the two platforms wii and ds who can resist
2596892 the spokesman for whoever presumptive democratic nominee sen barack obama d ill taps as his running korg ds 10 super mario bros theme
2596893 its enriching for the birds it provides a physical activity that is out of the norm for them
2596894 man what happened to you why cant you just have a few
2596895 i would if i could but its probably best that i dont
2596896 give this to her will you my lastest batch pretty damn close to the original i think
2596897 you too but it wont be long and then it will all be over eh
2596898 she just tends to forget things like what happened so just dont correct her if she calls you by their names alright
2596899 come in come in oh by the light its good to see you
2596900 oh im terribly sorry i sort of forgot about him i hope its alright i brought him along
2596901 yes yes its fine mouse doesnt get many visitors and forgets his manners
2596902 oh i should see about some lunch or something you must be starving arminas
2596903 as the north american product has been accepted more widely in the past year and a half it makes business sense and allows us to be more cost effective while giving the styling that our customers desire there will be a handful of designers in new york focused on making adjustments to our north american designs for our european customers
2596904 our design team in the uk will be impacted these things are always incredibly tough and we dont take them casually but after considerable thought and analysis
2596905 it is a very difficult economic climate the recent north american ranges have been more fashion forward and thats something that european customers respond well to
2596906 i know people will do something like this just to ruin the atmosphere
2596907 they dont like people to be happy but thats just a minority of people
2596908 we know the security here in this olympics time is really really good
2596909 i dont know how this guy can just jump into someone probably by accident and get hurt its really sad
2596910 but im sure the government themselves will tighten up on security even on individuals
2596911 we believe the olympics is spread across too much its from badminton to water polo to shooting to anything how do you target what you want to achieve from the olympics we dont think its worthwhile not for our category
2596912 when we do sponsorship its really important that we can build a lot of activities around it right up to the event and across many of our markets thats where the value for us is in sponsorships its very hard to target activity around the olympics it doesnt fit its not right for us
2596913 we wouldnt do just it for a one off just to sponsor the olympics in china and then come out again no we are more tactical in our sponsorships
2596914 if you look across our european businesses we have all kinds of different colours shapes and diameters which sometimes makes it hard to be efficient in the supply chain
2596915 we have to get it down to a smaller number we have defined a platform for europe for between 25 35 bottles in total so if any of our markets wants to introduce a new beer product its packaging has to be within that platform we have to simplify to make it much more efficient
2596916 oh yes im not going to tell you the number but its significant
2596917 its the biggest but theyre flying off the shelves in russia
2596918 women probably wouldnt like it as much as men but when you go to the cities you find people standing outside sharing a drink and instead of buying two or three bottles they share a big can its different its new
2596919 the biggest single inhibition to fixing itv is having a part time executive chairman and now chief executive
2596920 if michael were 42 and wholly committed to itv as chief executive you might give it a chance
2596921 the first 18 months have not been a flying start
2596922 grade has the right strategy however he has got to get a much better grip on the online business and execute more convincingly on content
2596923 the solution is content we are strong believers in the huge value of content
2596924 i think all other big studio bosses here and in hollywood would say the same
2596925 receiving the support of this party british energy needs more new nuclear expertise experience and knowledge technologies centricas not going to provide that
2596926 long term power off take arrangements centrica participating in british energys potential new nuclear partnerships or a possible merger of centrica with british energy only if terms could be agreed and if all parties are fully supportive
2596927 the challenge with business link is that traditionally its advisers are not people who run businesses themselves very few people have time to make an appointment at 4pm on a friday afternoon what they really want is to be able to go home put their kids to bed have dinner and log on and access the information they need
2596928 while there was a lot of support at an early stage it was typically governmental support filling in the right forms applying for grants and loans
2596929 there is a whole other side to business support that is lacking the ability to call on others who have been there maybe only a couple of years before you
2596930 most producers think distributors mess up the sale of their babies there is lots of mutual distrust the producers think their films never realise their potential because they are poorly marketed and distributed
2596931 we are not afraid to raise 100m if we needed to
2596932 london 2012 represents a unique opportunity for british and international business it will showcase the citys strength and attributes and its creativity and innovation as the worlds attention shifts from beijing to london
2596933 when we get one reason to sell after another people start throwing in the towel
2596934 its not going to break the russian economy but war is bad for investor sentiment
2596935 it is going to be difficult for ba and american to defend the indefensible
2596936 they will have such a dominant share at heathrow and jfk that there is no justification for this being in the consumer interest
2596937 open skies has created hardly any extra competition and in fact there are fewer carriers now operating between the uk and us than there were before
2596938 silverjet eos and maxjet have gone heathrow is full and slots arent available so no other carrier can even attempt to replicate ba aas network
2596939 theres nothing to stop virgin or any other airline competing on routes if they believe there is not enough competition
2596940 if we submit this application and if its approved there will be nine airlines operating across the atlantic and virgin will be the only one without anti trust immunity they have got to recognise that the whole competitive climate has changed instead of just making the same arguments they did eight years ago
2596941 it went down due to the fact that bear stearns collapsed in new york and commercial first lost all its funding lines
2596942 we had a business model that was based around commercial first and we couldnt keep all our staff
2596943 we suspended lending in mid march following the collapse of bear stearns
2596944 we restructured the business in april bringing staff numbers down from 190 to 85

2596987 to be quite honest whitney doesnt look like a plus sized model to me
2596988 i started indd in the spring of 92 following two things the first was seeing a television programme where women were having their stomachs stapled one woman had split the staples and was in for her third op eration and then a young girl of 15 committed suicide because she couldnt cope being fat she was size 14 12 in us i decided somebody had to stand up and try to stop this bloody madness and in the absence of anybody else i decided it would be me so i sent out a press release titled fat woman bites back and got some media attention i was desperate to keep the anti diet size acceptance concept in the public eye so without really thinking about it at the end of a live tv interview i said dont forget to celebrate no diet day having declared it on prime time national tv i then set about organising a picnic in hyde park alas it rained so we adjourned to my living room instead

2596991 i had three meals and two snacks today they were so satisfying that so far im doing great i stopped by my favorite restaurant to meet a business associate but i was so full and satisfied after tals meal i only ordered sparkling water thats a first those are oprahs parentheses not mine the smell of garlicky simmering fillets and steak dianne were wafting all around me and i had absolutely no problem resisting
2596992 the people in this town have been through so much loss this year and my heart goes out to them

2596997 the uacs goal in this project is to raise awareness because most people have no idea what sharia law is
2596998 we are confident people will see the billboard and learn on their own what sharia law is and come to their own conclusions at the very least we hope our billboard will spark public debate on this overlooked issue
2596999 under sharia law if you are accused of stealing a hand and foot from opposite sides are amputated if you are caught having an affair the woman is stoned to death and the man is given 80 lashes if you change religions you can be charged under apostasy laws and given the death sentence by a legal sharia court if you want to marry a nine year old child sharia law condones pedophilia because mohammad married aisha at six and consummated the marriage at age nine i find these and many more practices of sharia law despicable and hateful

2597002 sharia is the glue that holds an islamic society together
2597003 the harsh punishments associated with sharia law in all facets of day to day life create a never ending atmosphere of abject fear for those living under sharia law
2597004 no i hate pizza hut because oh are you still eating

2597006 the misconception is and the thing that people are getting wrong is that i realize im blessed i was part of the ufc and im blessed with what theyve done for me
2597007 i wouldnt be in the situation im in if it werent for them
2597008 is that from an economic point of view i have to think of economics i was a business major you have to think that way i think about taxes and my roth ira and my retirement plan and how long can i do this for i know im not randy couture and i know i cant be 44 years old and still compete i gave myself a five year plan to do what i can and thats what i was talking about
2597009 when they put it on the internet its like they took everything and multiplied it by an astronomical number

2597024 the passing of our great poet mahmoud darwish the lover of palestine the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project and the brilliant national leader will leave a great gap in our political cultural and national lives
2597025 words cannot describe the depth of sadness in our hearts
2597026 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2597027 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2597028 so leave our land our shore our sea our wheat our salt our wound

2597053 part of it is a fantasy reality thing and how it affects the whole persona of someone watching these fabulous actresses completely change their look
2597054 sanaa was approaching the screen like a painting which was really exciting to me
2597055 there was a delicacy to her look so i used a lot of white on white and blue
2597056 but underneath youll see green and some hot pinks and little bits and pieces that just kind of pop out of her
2597057 each of the actresses had their own pants because their sizes are so amazingly diverse with their heights
2597058 we had to keep the leg long and make sure it had a nice sensuality for the girls so it didnt look clunky
2597059 they went through a huge process of distressing and then certain patches and things got put on and some of those things got distressed
2597060 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2597061 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2597062 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2597063 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2597064 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve

2597107 im not going to have to worry about him because somebody else down south is going to take him out if that man is elected president hell be shot sure as hell the hate would be so deep down south
2597108 the kkk or someone will assassinate obama if we get a n president all you n s sic will think youve won and that the white people will have to bow to you f that
2597109 we are looking at every possibility and making sure that we have prepared for every conceivable contingency if someone is threatening violence we will go to great lengths to deal with that
2597110 people on these racist and white supremacist websites are being quite careful because they know that if they make a threat they will very likely get a visit from the secret service
2597111 the scary thing out there is the lone wolf phenomenon there are enough crazy people in this movement that it is possible one of them will decide today is the day to kick off the aryan revolution
2597112 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking
2597113 the general awareness and demand for lpg is up and its been getting progressively more popular for the last six months we are inundated with inquiries about getting conversions done
2597114 the majority of cars we get are large six or eight cylinder engines although there are a number of smaller engines like mondeos and hondas coming through as well
2597115 you should do at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity above usual activity at work or home on at least five days of the week if you are already overweight or obese then you should aim to do between 60 and 90 minutes on five days of the week
2597116 nhs primary care staff felt there was a need for a guide that had appropriate advice for patients
2597117 its up to the discretion of the gp or nurse how they use this information its not about going to the gym but doing things like gardening to benefit health
2597118 this has to operate in tandem with advice support and education on healthy eating and making sensible lifestyle choices in order to make a significant impact on the weight of individuals there has to be a commitment to do as much exercise as possible
2597119 if somebody is suffering from the medical consequences of being obese or overweight they may be at risk of chronic heart disease stroke or have high blood pressure but if they lose weight they are more likely to reduce their health risks so it may be appropriate to raise the potential for exercise with the patient thats a discussion that has to take place between the gp and the patient
2597120 its a personal responsibility and people will not be helped unless they want to help themselves
2597121 most people who have not exercised before would struggle even to walk for 90 minutes a day let alone do weight training
2597122 what i generally recommend to my clients is 30minutes three times a week thats based on whats practical for them a lot of people work from 8am to 6pm to tell them that they need to do an extra hour and a half of exercising will put people off i think if i was an obese person i would be quite disheartened
2597123 it is somewhat dictatorial and inappropriate for many people it would be far better to make small changes to your lifestyle
2597124 when she got the call that a liver had been found gillian was shocked frightened and happy all at the same time
2597125 we are absolutely ecstatic that this has happened but we are thinking about the donors family as well who are not celebrating at this time however this was their wish and the fact that they have saved my sisters life means that the donors death was not in vain
2597126 she knew that she had to get this operation or she would not be here is a few years it is going to be a long road to recovery for our gillian but she will get there
2597127 gillian has backed scotland on sundays campaign for presumed consent for organ donation and she will continue to do so because she feels so strongly about it
2597128 this operation shows there is hope for others on the waiting list she had waited a long time
2597129 it would be easy to curl up in a ball and give up
2597130 in the light of what is happening in zimbabwe it is extremely regrettable that the scottish parliament has to be involved in investing in zimbabwe i would be hopeful that as a corporate body we would be able to influence this decision
2597131 if we cant influence it then that is regrettable as a member of the corporate body i will be suggesting that they discuss this with baillie gifford their investment managers to find out whether there is any flexibility in the way it is managed
2597132 i have no idea how its funded or invested in that sense but like most msps i would be pretty concerned i should imagine that msps would be unhappy with it and people will start asking questions
2597133 by investing in a company the scottish parliament is giving both financial and moral support to what the company is doing you cant condemn something with one hand if you are paying for it with the other
2597134 the members pension scheme is part of a pooled fund which operates in accordance with the united nations principles for responsible investment
2597135 the parliament is only one of a large number of investors in the fund and cannot therefore direct where investments are made our total investment in this fund would have to be worth more than 50m in order for msps to be able to direct the investments
2597136 anglo american is deeply concerned about the current political situation in zimbabwe and condemns the violence and human rights abuses that are taking place
2597137 the responsible development of the unki mine will create a long term viable business which will be important to the economic future of zimbabwe for years to come
2597138 such investments might be serving to perpetuate robert mugabes despotic regime
2597139 the uk government is deeply concerned by the violence in georgia
2597140 the escalation in fighting is dangerously destabilising and there is also the threat of civilian losses on a large scale
2597141 reports of fighting and bombing outside south ossetia are especially disturbing as they represent a broadening and deepening of the conflict
2597142 the uk believes it is vital for leaderships on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2597143 the uk will be discussing with all our partners how to stop the spread of violence secure a ceasefire and get talks under way
2597144 georgia has been attacked by a formidable force it is a brutal attack with the use of air force tanks and even the trademark cyber attack
2597145 what they are fighting over in king lear is the land so the land has got to have a quality to it which we feel scotland has
2597146 what scotland gives us is its epicness and its beauty its just amazing
2597147 we are going to have a look at all of them
2597148 the one thing that im staying away from is stunt casting so there wont be the american comedian but there will be some really great actors playing smaller roles

2597158 the head of the ulna does not rotate around its long axis nor does it move side to side through motion at the elbow joint
2597159 the portion of the vertebral border above the base of the spine may occasionally be seen under a thin or stretched muscle layer the lateral axillary border and the superior border are deep
2597160 in life because of the muscle massa anterior to the elbow joint the epicondyles are located toward the back of the elbow region close to the olecranon process of the ulna
2597161 this shows that there needs to be far more robust checks in place within local government over expenses they now exist in the scottish parliament but there is no real scrutiny being placed on councils this needs to be looked at and examined properly
2597162 its fair to say when we saw charlies claims there were a few eyebrows raised to put it mildly
2597163 spoken to councillor cefferty about his abnormally high mileage says he has a large area to cover and is working 13 hours a day
2597164 i have nothing to hide i have a lot of miles because i do lots of house visits thats a brand new car and its done 7 000 miles in three months i am renowned for the amount of work i do
2597165 my ward was enlarged to three times the size in may last year and since then everybody wants to speak to you they phone up all the councillors and play them one against each other and i want to be there first
2597166 i only do the work that i do and i dont claim for anything outwith the work i do in the past i have claimed probably 40 less than the miles i do
2597167 in the daytime at weekends and even in the early hours of the morning
2597168 when i do my house visits its not a milk round you cant see people in one particular area all together im a reactive councillor so i go where im needed
2597169 im in the civic centre most evenings because i have got peace and quiet there but i dont go to all the meetings because sometimes you are more productive by doing constituency work im a constituency councillor
2597170 my wife runs the pub and i am a partner in that pub i have to have an income its only recently they have started to pay councillors properly my car isnt paid by the council its paid for by my business
2597171 i dont get involved in council politics for any self gain i get driven by whats happening in the community thats why i get re elected if wee jeannie needs something done charlie cefferty goes and does it
2597172 i am going to try and have better time management and work from home more in my office because at the moment i dont have any spare time
2597173 councillors expenses are subject to regular and periodic audits as part of the normal internal and external audit arrangements beyond publishing annually the details of such expenses the council would not consider it appropriate to comment on individual claims
2597174 the government should be supporting many other organisations who are also vying for the governments attention we dont have anything against the sif but it isnt wise to throw so much money at this organisation people are very upset about it
2597175 providing every document detailed on the rrri application form is not a mandatory requirement of securing grant funding like every other one of the 33 organisations that won funding they provided sufficient information for the process of independent evaluation led by officials to take place
2597176 america has spoken candidly and consistently about our concerns over the chinese governments behaviour we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2597177 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century
2597178 democracy and human rights are more important than the olympics
2597179 the captain of a small starfleet or klingon empire ship
2597180 high up in a stained glass window in the war memorial is the horseman faithful and true from the bibles book of revelation on his cloak is a swastika even as the mortar was drying in the walls this ancient symbol of fortune was appearing in the skies over europe the insignia of a man who like the rider on the white horse would smite the nations and rule over them with a rod of iron adolf hitler
2597181 king james iv was able to spy on his subjects gathered in the great hall though a little barred window up and to the right of the fireplace
2597182 prior to mikhail gorbachevs visit to the castle in 1984 the kgb asked that the lug be bricked up on security grounds
2597183 mr gorbachev never made it to the castle on that occasion for that very morning he received news of the death of his predecessor as general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union konstantin chernenko
2597184 many people assumed they knew virtually all these was to know about edinburgh castle but these stories have shown that there is always more to learn
2597185 giving a little bit of humanity to a place as austere and dignified as the castle is wonderful we want to whet peoples appetites and entice them to come and see these real oddities which make the castle such a unique place to visit
2597186 the swastika was added in the aftermath of the first world war but before the second world war when it was appropriated by the nazis
2597187 apart from anything else it is part of a stunningly beautiful window
2597188 the whole point of the lairds lug is that it allows you to overhear the conversation below the kgb really didnt like the idea and insisted it had to be blocked off before gorbachev would come in
2597189 they wanted to make sure nobody could eavesdrop or fire a gun at him from up there the castle were happy to go along with the request on the basis that it was entirely reversible i used to use the room as an office and one day people marched in and started bricking it up
2597190 it is a symbol that still arouses deep emotions in people as we saw from the reaction to prince harry wearing one in fancy dress
2597191 young people are thinking its acceptable fashionable necessary for them to protect themselves to carry a knife just like we made guns unacceptable we should make knives unacceptable
2597192 you need not just young people but parents and other people to say that knives in britain like guns like bullying like racism all these things are unacceptable we have to persuade people its not a thing government can do only people in the community have got to in a sense rise up and say this is unacceptable behaviour
2597193 there are certain boundaries in a decent society you dont cross and these boundaries are cultural because in america it is acceptable for many people to carry guns its not in britain i think in britain weve got to make it as unacceptable to carry knives i think most decent people in our country would want to do that and i think what you will see over the next few months is this sort of campaign which is led not just by government but people in the country to say get knives off our streets its completely unacceptable
2597194 he is campaigning on change and he has got a great message going out the country about how america can play a bigger part in the world and how america can grow
2597195 were working on a fifth one the debates weve agreed to first of all you cant do all the debates you get lots of invitations you pick the ones that get most coverage around the state we look for the ones with the best format for getting out our message and it has nothing to do with whether or not betsy russell a spokesman review reporter is on the panel
2597196 gori is the staging post for the georgian military heading towards the front in south ossetia
2597197 on saturday morning we were talking to and filming a number of very fresh faced looking georgian recruits called up as part of president saakashvilis full mobilisation of the military on friday
2597198 they looked relaxed and calm all of a sudden the sound of a warplane was heard overhead and there was a huge explosion not too far away
2597199 they scattered like flies they didnt know what to do these men were not hardened troops by any manner of means
2597200 there were cars driving in all directions carrying the injured
2597201 we got reports from witnesses and civilians that outside villages had also been hit
2597202 we have seen a number of russian aerial strikes throughout the morning they have certainly hit a georgian military installation
2597203 we cant tell how many casualties are inside it is blocked off there is a munitions depot inside and there are shells exploding
2597204 we have seen a number of injured civilians being led away we have seen elderly people being led away we have seen families heading out of gori fearing the worst and heading towards tbilisi and hoping they will find some sort of the safety there
2597205 the battle lines in this conflict are becoming extremely ugly they are no longer just inside south ossetia russia has been making air incursions into georgian territory
2597206 soldiers have been running through the streets as well as civilians fleeing for safety
2597207 we saw the impact of the air strikes and we have also seen that the russians missed their targets at least once and hit a residential apartment block
2597208 two buildings are on fire with civilians inside we saw at least one man pulled out dead and were told that a number of people were killed or injured
2597209 there are claims from the georgian side that several georgian military bases were bombed by russian aircraft and a port in the south of the country on the black sea coast a long way from gori
2597210 clearly the russians are choosing a lot of targets around the country
2597211 the planes are bombing us i am sitting here in the basement fire is raging above us let somebody come and help us where are the peacekeepers i am sitting here with other people
2597212 my son has been killed why does nobody come to save us
2597213 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined building in cars
2597214 russia is fond of saying georgia is in our backyard
2597215 but its reasonable to ask what difference does that make these nations are independent countries that have the right to chart their own future
2597216 russia has resented this break up of the old soviet union
2597217 they have been looking for an opportunity to wean people back
2597218 right now we are managing but it is a very difficult situation
2597219 ive never experienced anything like this weve drilled our mountains full of holes looking for water this situation will have a long term impact on our flora and fauna
2597220 wet matches dont light which is terrible news when it dont stop raining oh well well make it
2597221 marks injury is not as bad as a lot of people feared it was so well take the reps until he gets back and well see what happens then
2597222 im happy for mark that the injury is not as serious as it could have been
2597223 but my thinking hasnt changed at all im still going to compete for first team reps
2597224 if he needs to blow his own trumpet well fine
2597225 but my mother who was a simple housewife she showed me the snake when i was a child
2597226 as i was coming home i heard the roar of jets
2597227 i fell to the ground instinctively and then there were these painfully loud bangs
2597228 they were such lovely people they were so excited about the baby
2597229 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2597230 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2597231 there have certainly been a lot of casualties the street next to ours was hit by firing and we saw bodies being taken away we are staying inside the house we have got three young children and they are very frightened
2597232 i went out and saw burnt tanks with dead bodies the police said that they were georgians who had been trying to come into the city then we heard planes and what sounded like firing from helicopters but it is very confusing and we dont know whats really going on
2597233 our peacekeepers and units subordinate to them are now carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to peace
2597234 if you thought cancer ward was funny wait until you get a load of anne franks diary
2597235 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2597236 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2597237 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2597238 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2597239 we a family of 5 are travelling to the west coast of ireland connemara for a week on a home exchange we paid a penny each way or the flights on a low cost carrier giveaway our accommodation of course cost us nothing the only expense is 75 car hire thats the grand sum of 15 02 each for a weeks holiday
2597240 when you say troll the discount airfare websites would you recommend signing up for their newsletters or did you actually have something else in mind also can you recommend any sites sorry for the dumb ish question im a total newbie at this whole home swap thing but im very interested and also very low on funds for a vacation thanks
2597241 hmm yes thats the form it does look beautiful in pencil
2597242 proportions are measured from bony landmarks but can be measured from flesh landmarks as well e g nipple navel
2597243 cylinder of the neck meets the base of the skull in back at the superior nuchal line
2597244 the nasal aperture is an upside down heart shaped opening
2597245 on average the male skull is larger more angular and more robust than the more delicate skull of the female
2597246 the costal cartilage of the second rib attaches to the sternum at the sternal angle making it a good point to begin counting the ribs in life
2597247 the medial ends of the clavicles articulate with the upper outer corners of the manubrium and along with the upper edge of the manubrium form the suprasternal jugular notch also called the pit of the neck
2597248 is going to meet the principals basically to advertisement update them on the progress so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2597249 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2597250 the june 4 suspension of humanitarian operations is estimated to have affected more than 1 5 million zimbabweans already this years poor harvest means that 5 million zimbabweans will face a severe food crisis if the ban is not lifted
2597251 we are concerned that more than two weeks after the signing of the memorandum of understanding and despite our diplomatic appeals we have seen no concrete steps taken to carry out this commitment
2597252 if id been a bit more savvy id still be on television
2597253 obviously theres a lot of women whove not been happy with the way i was with them ive never raised my hand to a woman or assaulted a woman but i might have disrespected women or not been proper with women i did have to change my behaviour after the allegations im just aware of everything all the time now always thinking could that be misconstrued as something else because obviously thats what happened before
2597254 i was a single guy with a lot of girlfriends i put my hands up to that but theres a canyon of difference between assault and seeing girls at no point ever did i put a woman in a situation that was not comfortable nothing happened
2597255 everyone is so scared and youre aware of how fragile and fickle it is
2597256 we also demand that the united nations and international society do not ignore the nuclear weapons of north korea pakistan and israel as well as the suspicions of nuclear development by iran but take stern measures against these countries
2597257 india whose nuclear cooperation with the us is a concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2597258 the bottom line for us is this is the way to get the cooperation we want this is the way to get the support for non proliferation
2597259 syrias election to the board while under investigation for secretly building an undeclared nuclear reactor not suited for peaceful purposes would make a mockery
2597260 the syrians said that a visit at this time was inopportune
2597261 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2597262 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and my core beliefs i recognised my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2597263 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2597264 young mothers in rural areas can feel quite isolated and we are an outlet for them to go out and meet new people
2597265 when young people leave school they often dont know how to cook
2597266 home economics does not seem to be one of the core subjects any more and a lot of parents are out working and dont have time to explain to their children how to cook either
2597267 there are many people who are just used to putting things in a microwave
2597268 the enthusiasm is there but a lot of the younger members do need to basically start from the very beginning
2597269 in my own area we ran a basic cooking school and showed people how to cook simple things such as pancakes and plain biscuits
2597270 it worked well and we got a lot of positive feedback
2597271 police in st andrews will work with the universitys student support services and associations to curb antisocial behaviour during events such as raisin week officers including our own university liaison officer will run a series of roadshows during freshers week to explain the consequences of drinking excessively with regard to personal safety and what effects having a criminal record could have on their chances of getting a job or visa application
2597272 the student community is aware that excessively drunken or criminal behaviour would naturally jeopardise the future of the celebrations not so much because the university might take action but because fife constabulary would arrest them
2597273 the university and police are trying to calm down the wilder aspects of raisin week the main problem was simply people drinking too much
2597274 we are going to be giving raisin week leaflets to every student which will advise them to enjoy themselves while drinking and acting sensibly
2597275 there will be four or five people singing with music about god
2597276 there was a slight safety risk for women wearing normal bras with metal parts underneath a bullet proof vest
2597277 if the vest is hit by a projectile this can have an impact on the metal bit in the bra underneath and cause injuries
2597278 they said we should go smoke some weed and were talking about being in a strip bar some really explicit things
2597279 on elviss side and on my side too i have twin brothers and then of course elvis had a twin brother who died at birth
2597280 that leads in my case and i would think in other cases as well to people saying well lets just not reinsulate the roof
2597281 we have no problem with the use of solar energy
2597282 marburg is already a leader when it comes to the use of solar energy but up until now theyve always tried to convince people rather than forcing them
2597283 its unfortunate that they decided to compel people because i think you breed opponents that way rather than friends of solar energy
2597284 we have a serious energy problem with the older homes
2597285 before solar installations were the exception and their absence was the rule
2597286 we want to get to the point where the opposite is the case
2597287 it wasnt very clear how and when that was going to happen it isnt reasonable to fund that unless there is a clear benefit
2597288 high profile projects such as the scotland funds often attract detractors criticism over delivery is in this case facile especially given our scarce resources and we note that none of the critics are prepared to be identified your readers can draw their own conclusions
2597289 the problem was one of inadequate funding the private sector had not supported us to levels we thought were necessary and the scottish government for their own reasons have decided also not to take this forward
2597290 as is the case with all funding applications a robust business case must be provided demonstrating the merit of the project and linking to the scottish governments strategic objectives
2597291 the population of south ossetia is 75 000 and our camps in darfur have 150 000 people in one camp so it should be relatively straightforward
2597292 right now its very unclear what access is allowed into south ossetia if we cannot get in we will have to focus on people that are leaving the area because if its a hostile environment access will be restricted even if we do get in i dont know how easy it is for us to move around
2597293 if it stays confined in south ossetia it is probably quite manageable from a humanitarian point of view but if the conflict does move to involve abkhazia another separatist area of georgia or if it causes a destabilisation of the government we could be looking at a much longer and more serious situation
2597294 there is nervousness among our people on the ground that the conflict will spread to tbilisi which would make it much more serious people are surprised by the degree of engagement by the russians
2597295 our regular customers know that to get the widest choice of low fares and availability they need to book early
2597296 scheduled airlines normally only put their inventory on sale nine months before so clearly the likes of globespan would be of interest to cruisers
2597297 i am keen to see the phasing out of existing contract cleaning in hospitals and i would want to see no more in the future with cleaning kept in house
2597298 the introduction of contract cleaning tenders to hospital cleaning started the decline in quality in hospital cleaning
2597299 we would welcome any commitment by the government to remove contracted out cleaning from scotlands hospitals but we also need to employ more cleaners and supply the resources that they require providing a quality service not the cheapest
2597300 cleaning services at the royal infirmary of edinburgh are provided by consort as part of the pfi contract and we would have to take account of the legal obligations of that contract in any changes to guidance on cleaning services for nhs scotland
2597301 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2597302 and when their roosts are disrupted or their normal prey grow scarce homo sapiens become a pretty easy meal
2597303 theyll have to strip search everyone who crosses that border or they wont know who we are theyll have to see the wbc westboro baptist church tattoo on our butts
2597304 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2597305 but i do support georgias president mikheil saakashvili and what russia is doing is wrong they must stop
2597306 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2597307 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2597308 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2597309 i suppose its the pollution it feels like youre at 3 000 metres because of the air you cannot breathe the air is thick and there is smog
2597310 i just didnt have any more strength in the legs
2597311 there was pressure for all of us but for her it was even harder
2597312 im sorry but the chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on chinese athletes
2597313 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2597314 los precios han bajado porque nuestra tarifa est en d lares por ejemplo comenzamos con 54 soles el examen para autos particulares y ahora estamos en 46 90 soles
2597315 la central de llamadas ya est funcionando con los n meros 213 2200 y 213 2860 tenemos hasta el momento unas 400 citas concertadas
2597316 los certificados y las calcoman as que se entregaron y se van a entregar van a tener validez hasta que el ministerio de transportes saque nuevas calcoman as y certificados
2597317 las plantas de villa el salvador y san mart n de porres cuentan con licencias de funcionamiento y en el caso de lima la planta est funcionando con la autorizaci n de lima metropolitana
2597318 el cierre de las operaciones en febrero de este a o fue una decisi n pol tica y no t cnica y lo vamos a demostrar justamente con el arbitraje si el servicio fuera malo y todos los problemas que aduce la municipalidad el tribunal arbitral no habr a ordenado la apertura de las plantas
2597319 el per puede llegar al mismo nivel de criminalidad de colombia
2597320 georgian authorities support a ceasefire and separation of the warring parties
2597321 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2597322 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2597323 hello oh hi mom im just reading well ive been busy going over catalogs from those colleges you suggested ill come over saturday and stay for supper that sound ok yeah ill see you then
2597324 come you can see me so i know you are not one of the mindless let us walk together and put distance between this place and ourselves

2597329 come sit here on this log and we will get acquainted
2597330 now i will tell you where you are and how you came to be here
2597331 windfallow is a small planet just around the corner from earth but a million miles away she was created at the same time as earth and fallowfolk and earthlings in that day could cross between the worlds through gates but the humans became corrupted and sinful they abused the privilege of communing with us and the gates were closed for the protection of all sometimes the gates become usable as this one did an evil being learned how to open it and has been sending mindless ones from earth to steal our rocks
2597332 mindless is the name we give to those who do not have the spirit of the maker within them the mindless from windfallow live in tunnels like the one into which you wandered the rocks i referred to are gemstones which we use for building stones like that one
2597333 that kat is an emerald we know now that you do not have such rocks on earth but people lust after them and that is what the mindless are stealing
2597334 yes we are dealing with the problem but you came in the midst of that operation
2597335 that would be nice but i have to get back before my folks miss me
2597336 we are sending out requests this day to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games

2597341 my dad took the old methods apart as athlete and coach we were inseparable the trouble with british athletes today is that they spend too much time with their accountants and not enough with their coaches
2597342 after wards i said to him you dont scare easily he replied i dont scare at all the past 45 years have been a fucking bonus that fearlessness made him a great man to have in your corner he had an extraordinary influence on my life
2597343 in the world of coaching he was inspiring and influencing there are few in the history of british athletics of whom it can be said that they are truly among the greats peter coe had a quiet determination and concentration to detail his contribution to seb and to british athletics was always of gold medal standard

2597350 this movement is vital for two reasons first it will help assure your victory against john mccain in november the long night of greed and military adventurism under the bush administration which a mccain administration would continue cannot be brought to an end a day too soon an enthusiastic corps of volunteers and organizers will ensure that voters turn out to close the book on the bush era on election day second having helped bring you the white house the support of this movement will make possible the changes that have been the platform of your campaign only a grassroots base as broad and as energized as the one that is behind you can counteract the forces of money and established power that are a dead weight on those seeking real change in american politics

2597374 in that building existed little more than a bunch of companies which

2597376 there was no significant loss of life in those towers their own evil
2597377 school performance should not be seen simply as a proxy for intelligence
2597378 doing badly at school is not a cause of schizophrenia but it is a marker for something not being quite right several years prior to diagnosis
2597379 this isnt going to be a way of identifying people at school who are at risk of developing schizophrenia
2597380 but it could be useful when considering someone who is displaying other potential symptoms of impending psychosis
2597381 it is important to recognise that mental illnesses like schizophrenia are not linked to low intelligence the opposite is often true
2597382 there are lots of reasons why young people perform poorly in exams
2597383 problems with concentration and mental distress can interfere with studying and these can also be early signs of mental illness symptoms that commonly begin in late teens
2597384 the people in the study might have had normal intelligence but started having low level symptoms that disrupted their schooling

2597393 i am practicing everyday because i want everyone to come have fun with me i think by the middle of this month we will be able to hear this song on the radio i would like to leave this album with everyone i guarantee every song will be cute and that there will be fast songs for us to dance like crazy to
2597394 there will also be slow emotional songs for everyone to sing along to as well for my fans that have asked about my new work with this work i guarantee we will have fun
2597395 we drew with real madrid drew with paris st germain and have players who could play in the fluminense team theyre not better than our best players they just have more of them

2597419 it is obvious that there has been a strong swing against the government
2597420 i have listened to that swing i will listen to what territorians said i take responsibility for the campaign
2597421 i believe in the principles that sit behind this side of politics he told the clp faithful
2597422 we rest on principles good principles and those principles when followed through can and will make a huge difference
2597423 we care enough to take a tough position on many issues its a tough road to hoe

2597425 some of the isps decided to nullroute so we changed ip so it works for them now some other decided to block the domain name so we added
2597426 were quite used to fascist countries not allowing freedom of speech a lot of smaller nations that have dictators decide to block our site since we can help spread information that could be harmful to the dictators
2597427 its quite funny that the country italy is run by the biggest media mogul of them all were his competitors
2597428 a dramatic rise in public concern and outrage about what is being broadcast into their homes
2597429 it means that really a tiny minority with a very focused political agenda is trying to censor american television and radio

2597445 yeah well more or less i realized id never forgotten how to fly so much as lost my wings after that it was just a matter of making new wings it took a while months but it doesnt matter nothing matters the pain the agony the loneliness nothing matters but going home

2597450 monday will mark the third anniversary of the forcible expulsion of the jews of gaza and northern samaria from their homes those expulsions were followed weeks later by the withdrawal of idf personnel from the gaza strip unlike the rabin peres governments decision to embark on the oslo peace process with the plo in 1993 ariel sharons withdrawal from gaza did not take years to be discredited it took moments as the last idf personnel left gaza the palestinians began torching the synagogues israel abandoned within minutes of israels withdrawal from gazas border with egypt the palestinians blew up the border wall they immediately began transferring unprecedented quantities of heavy weaponry into gaza a practice that has continued to this day another important distinction between the oslo policy and the withdrawal policy is that at least oslo asked the palestinians to give israel something in exchange for the land money arms and political legitimacy israel lavished on them as events would show israel asked the palestinians for too little but at least israel asked them for something the withdrawal policy in contrast demanded nothing from the palestinians it was simply an unconditional surrender of land as a result hamas the terror group which has distinguished itself from fatah by refusing to even pay lip service to peace was the chief beneficiary of israels retreat hamass ascendance to power came the day after israel completed its withdrawal tens of thousands of armed hamas terrorists clad in spanking new uniforms goose stepped through the streets of gaza in their victory parade the then ruling fatah governments own parade was dingy and poorly attended in comparison hamass pageantry was followed with the jihadist groups decisive electoral victory over fatah in january 2006 this led to the further weakening of fatah in march 2007 with the signing of the mecca accord that rendered fatah a junior member of hamass ruling coalition the mecca accord also signaled a shift in the arab worlds sympathies from fatah to hamas that agreement then paved the way for hamass violent ouster of fatah forces from gaza in june 2007 and its rising challenge to fatahs leadership in judea and samaria it should be pointed out that hamass victory over fatah was not a victory of extremists over moderates in any real sense of the terms both hamas and fatah share the aim of destroying israel this was made clear most recently in the lead up to the annapolis conference last november as us secretary of state condoleezza rice announced the coming of peace fatah leader mahmoud abbas refused to recognize israels right to exist
2597451 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2597452 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2597453 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2597454 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events

2597456 its going to hem in the fed its going to be harder for the fed to weaken what theyve proposed
2597457 it sends a message that you did the right thing
2597458 the fed is going to act and is going to establish a new baseline for consumer protection that everyone will follow
2597459 we hope they will consider the impact this will have on pricing in the marketplace and the big question of whether or not low risk consumers are going to have to subsidize people who pose a higher risk
2597460 as a matter of psychology i think most of us value investors think we have plenty enough bargains already and may not be able to handle that many more
2597461 until the values can be defined i think youre somewhat taking your life into your hands
2597462 a lot of value investors went into financials in the spring and theyre now getting killed
2597463 a small portion of our losses will not be recovered we underestimated the speed and severity of credit deterioration and overestimated some companies ability to cope with credit and liquidity problems
2597464 people get very excited about their causes and lack the sense to see if the information backs them up

2597490 i always tell people my dad tried to make me into a prima donna
2597491 youre bound to meet and have some friends from new jersey there are quite a few people living there
2597492 no i bought an 83 mercury for 4 000 found it on the internet i put 10 000 into it sound system and tires my dad kept telling me how much a new car depreciates once you drive it off a lot
2597493 he really struggled in the beginning trying to get a grasp of the defense
2597494 hes been better this past week in camp its a hard adjustment for a young player who was used to doing a lot of two gapping in college when he gets tired sometimes he reverts back to that but he is a good player and he works hard and hes always trying to please
2597495 but we needed an end and chris is an end we needed someone who can put some pressure on from the other side
2597496 he has had double digit sack seasons and i view him as a premier pass rusher in this league and if hes not that then i dont know what this nfl is all about im hoping i can be an asset to this team and take some of the pressure off of him
2597497 everything is different for me as far as the scheme goes
2597498 i am playing away from the ball and learning how to play in space the other thing is learning how to deal with the techniques of the guys across from me i was terrible in mini camp but once i started to learn i felt a lot better i like playing in pads a lot better than just shorts
2597499 chris is the kind of player who is going to work his way through it when everything is not working for him
2597500 he will figure it out it may take some time but i know he feels like he has made strides already
2597501 its not like hes asking for help and advice all the time
2597502 its more father son stuff a lot of our messages are very short and at the end of the day when hes pretty tired
2597503 chris and i think we have a pretty big future in show business if this whole football thing doesnt work out
2597504 you can tell that he doesnt mind any of this stuff the razzing his new hairdo
2597505 he has fit right in and become one of the guys he is very self motivated and hes driven to succeed i really do believe he wont disappoint
2597506 if mothers could learn to do for themselves what they do for their children we should have happier households let the mother go out to play if she would only have courage to let everything go when life becomes too tense and just take a day or half a day out in the fields or with a favorite book or in a picture gallery looking long and well at just two or three pictures or in bed without the children life would go on far more happily for both children and parents
2597507 the technology has improved the safety systems we now require have greatly improved and the industry has a good record
2597508 the shutoff valves below the ocean floor all of them worked
2597509 history shows us we can drill environmentally friendly if you will
2597510 in reality theres probably more risk of an incident from a tanker going down the coast to get into the gulf or vice versa than there is putting a well in 1 000 feet of water
2597511 even if they arent spewing out of their rigs the entire process is incredibly dirty
2597512 theres no way you can tell me it wont have an impact on our coast and our coast in georgia is incredibly valuable
2597513 its not about whether its safe to drill again or not
2597514 its about whether its safe for mankind to use this product or not
2597515 we dont know if this former aide is involved in some sort of cover up
2597516 we still dont know about the actual paternity of the child
2597517 inflating the currency and then having less product to buy and charging you fees to do it its hyperinflation
2597518 i wish it wasnt the kind of decision we felt we had to make
2597519 this new structure will attract more new customers benefit current customers and help differentiate delta from other carriers
2597520 are trying to stay competitive and be a little more innovative
2597521 fuel and luggage surcharges have been bad press they are trying to tweak some things to mitigate that
2597522 we listened to a lot of people saying dont touch that
2597523 but we borrowed out of it and were retired and just fine
2597524 we paid the loan back in about a year but after we were done we started looking at what we had lost by not having that money in the stock market
2597525 for us it would have been smarter to have lived in an apartment for a couple of years and just saved for a down payment
2597526 but before you tap the plan you want to make sure that youve thought it through small decisions made today can have enormous consequences
2597527 i just want to alert people to the true cost
2597528 hes a wealth of information mike has promoted the sports corp and he has taken the job as seriously as if it was the same job with the united states olympic committee i cant thank mike enough for what hes done for the sports corp and the sports community in colorado springs
2597529 what is the one thing you would change about colorado springs
2597530 have the local news media stop treating denver sports teams as their lead stories we have our own identity here and we are not south denver how can the local television stations justify opening their evening news sports segment with tape of the previous evenings nuggets or avalanche game and how about a tiger monday for or sky sox friday in the gazette this isnt kansas
2597531 hes certainly someone who has an opinion but hes also someone who loves this area and has really promoted sport throughout the united states theres not a reporter in this country that works sports full time nationally that doesnt know and respect mike moran

2597536 tricolour carrying patriots of jammu versus pakistani flag bearers of kashmir
2597537 movement the accumulated causes go even further back the decades amarnath is probably merely the latest flashpoint
2597538 weve put up with this for 60 years 60 long years
2597539 all in the name of national unity those who blackmail the nation with threats of separation have been pampered those who have been loyal have been ignored what am i to do to be heard pick up a green flag and shout anti india slogans why can we not have land in kashmir why must kashmiris have their way all the time in this country
2597540 this is the first time jammu has shaken up the country and the valley and that is because of the accumulated history of grievances the valley has got too much national attention too consistently it is jammus turn now and it believes it has reasons to scream it wants corrections
2597541 but that is because of the nature of when and how these frustrations have come to be vented
2597542 it is true that the sangh and its front organisations are in the forefront it is also possible that the bjp will draw electoral mileage from this not only in jammu but elsewhere too

2597544 according to the latest information available the city continues to resist the incursion of georgian troops and has still not been captured
2597545 the georgian snipers keep firing at vehicles transporting the wounded to the hospitals of south ossetia
2597546 the women and children in tskhinvali suffer of thirst the city has not had any access to water gas electricity for 3 days the cell phones are losing power the georgian snipers shoot anyone who tries to get out into the street
2597547 an intense massive shelling of living blocks of the city by georgian forces using mortars artillery bmps tanks and the grad missle launch systems the shells come in bursts the intervals between the bursts are less than a second
2597548 tskhinvali is under control of the south ossetian forces but the extermination of the georgian gun layers who coordinate the fire on the city continues
2597549 some shelling to the houses near the border fire and smoke everywhere the exact number of victims is unknown to me its quite clear this war is not aimed to achieve some kind of political victory this war is aimed to completely exterminate the civilian population
2597550 about 5000 civilians remain in tskhinvali whose evacuation is not possible at the moment the georgian side continues to bomabard the territory with all weapons available including the grad launch rocket systems howitzers and tanks the road to the city is under heavy fire tbilisi should provide at least a 2 3 hours corridor to evacuate the wounded

2597553 i was very careful to say i was not trying to scare anyone away from open source and i thought the chances of anyone getting sued were very unlikely and i actually said several times that the sflc and busybox were not trying to make money they were trying to get people to comply with the gpl

2597556 smoke in the atmosphere temporarily reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface this transitory effect could partly offset some of the warming caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases and other pollutants
2597557 the heating of the smoke layer and cooling of the surface can lead to increased atmospheric stability which in turn may keep clouds from forming
2597558 we think that this influence of smoke aerosol on clouds further affects the balance of radiation reaching the surface in the arctic

2597561 it might seem odd that one of the goals of britains biggest branded truck company is to get trucks off the road but that is exactly what we are trying to do
2597562 it seems ironic that we are now looking to revive more traditional modes of transport but new pressures such as congestion rising fuel prices and the environment mean the old methods are becoming viable again
2597563 britain is covered with castles that were built in medieval times when people had to protect themselves from invaders but there are no longer battles and no one is suggesting that we restore them to their original function why should it be different for canals we cant influence the prevailing economics the amount of subsidies given to canal transport dwindles into insignificance alongside those given to roads because canals are not judged to be a transport network
2597564 in cases where it would cost 11 per tonne to transport some cargo by road and 10 per tonne to transport it by water companies often stick with road because it is the tried and tested option
2597565 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically

2597572 at the moment i dont see any candidates certainly from the bn anwar is going to win what will be interesting is the margin whether it is bigger or less than what he obtained previously
2597573 i had a text off him to say well done congratulations as ive had off numerous people
2597574 we get on fine it was only last year that he was in my office at milton keynes having a glass of red wine what lessons from him will i be taking into this job standards thats the main thing i can say about him what some people class them as are very different to what his standards are he implements that in his team and his players
2597575 you have to realise i have come into a new club where there are a lot of things different to what i am used to

2597626 from what we have seen so far england look pretty handy but they have always been handy theyre a very good cricket team
2597627 but from a south african point of view we certainly dont want to lose any test matches
2597628 we would be really gutted to lose the last test match here
2597629 as long as we remember the things that have got us to this point we will be fine going forward and we will keep improving
2597630 the guys are going to be fighting to win this one because we still have the opportunity to do so
2597631 we feel we can defend 220 and if we can get that high there will be a lot of pressure on the england top five
2597632 i dont want to make excuses because it was a pretty ordinary performance
2597633 the thing that i kept reminding the guys about and what i have been reminding them in the second innings is we forgot all the things we have been doing well over the past 18 months
2597634 that comes down to relaxing slightly mentally we werent as tight or as decisive in our movements or as patient as weve been
2597635 mentally the guys werent in the same space as they were at the start of the series
2597636 he had a problem when he started but when i came in he was a guy we identified to bat at three for us

2597642 hes happy to carry on the doctors seen it and doesnt think he has done any structural damage so hell carry on with painkillers and well sort it out afterwards
2597643 he did brilliantly because it was definitely no more than a half or a third chance
2597644 he got a hand on it but if you watch the footage back hes got an awfully long way to get there
2597645 inside edges are especially difficult for keepers because youre setting yourself for the outside edge all the time
2597646 id give him credit for getting a hand to it actually i wouldnt have got anywhere near it dont worry about that
2597647 timmy handles things really well hes a very level headed bloke
2597648 whether hes done well by getting a hundred at wellington or had tougher times he stays very much at an even keel which is very much a strength of his
2597649 he makes some difficult things look very easy when the ball wobbles and moves around so i think hes handled himself very well
2597650 its a pressure environment we know that and he knows that and hes desperate to get a score in the second innings

2597789 hes going against some great competition on our offensive line and when you add in what weve got on the back end with smith mike mickens and underwood all getting their hands on balls with either break ups or interceptions its pretty clear that we have a very talented defense that said we still have a lot of work to do

2597807 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2597808 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2597818 sometimes people are together for 10 or 20 years and then get married and there is a different feeling
2597819 there is no longer a relationship based on trust but based on a piece of paper

2597878 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital

2597880 when i am president the united states will stand shoulder to shoulder with israel

2597884 geez alicia what do you expect its not that odd that people would ask you those things being that you are pregnant

2597888 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2597889 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2597890 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2597891 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2597892 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
2597893 shes devastated however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
2597894 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end
2597895 when they started dating he said girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich and her response was okay and they were married thats how he charmed her with his sense of humor
2597896 when they got married they were kids he was 20 and she was 19 they both grew up together and they both matured in this marriage
2597897 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2597898 well the reason that i am listening to my feelings now is because they are the voice of my soul
2597899 the nature of his injuries were such that in spite of their efforts his life could not be saved
2597900 no matter where he worked or who he worked with he just fit in well with everybody
2597901 he was a very outgoing likeable man and will be missed
2597902 we at the second battalion now focus our efforts on ensuring he is laid to rest with the honour and dignity he deserves
2597903 there was a civilian convoy in the vicinity and the incident will be investigated
2597904 the death of roberts is being investigated and until we have conclusive results of the investigation i cant give you a definitive statement
2597905 private contractors routinely operate within the battle space and they provide essential security to a lot of development and stabilization groups
2597906 i dont know whether they had a legitimate target or not
2597907 theres going to be an investigation into all of this activity
2597908 we are deeply affected by this loss josh will be greatly missed by his military family
2597909 as task force commander i offer my deepest condolences to the members of joshs family to his fiancee and to his friends and colleagues know that we stand with you in your grief and we will do all we can to help you through the difficult days ahead
2597910 but there was a tim hortons so it was all good
2597911 josh had a good ear he was a good listener
2597912 he love soldiering some people are calling it a tragedy but he died doing what he loved so thats not a tragedy
2597913 a no nonsense kind of guy who lived like people dreamed
2597914 he was a fun loving and genuine individual who was totally dedicated to the army and held his section together he looked out for his guys in ways they probably didnt realize
2597915 youtube is an amazing video sharing site its great to get everyone together
2597916 its all about the experience meeting together and really understanding the celebration of the virtual world
2597917 the whole interesting thing about the youtube community is its all about connecting to others
2597918 youtube has its own culture its own celebrities its own politics
2597919 the youtube stars are kind of like the new tv stars
2597920 there might be youtube celebrities here but its also the ones that arent that well known the ones that you make friends with online they are the ones who make me really happy to meet in person
2597921 just enjoyed sort of being in the moment and doing the paddling
2597922 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2597923 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2597924 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2597925 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2597926 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2597927 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2597928 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2597929 in areas where there have been trappings we are starting to get reports of sightings of red squirrels for the first time in years
2597930 we are only promoting targeted control in areas where it will have a definite benefit on reds if you dont control numbers of greys in those areas you will lose reds
2597931 we need a concerted effort over a few years to control greys the majority of people are supportive we are trying to save a native species after all
2597932 we are concerned about the welfare of both red and grey squirrels
2597933 the fuddy duddy days of birdwatching have passed it is a major mainstream activity now
2597934 twitchers and twitching are sheding their anorakish nerdy image a large part of this is down to the popularity of the latest generation of wildlife broadcasters and shows like springwatch and autumnwatch
2597935 they have made nature observers from many more people from the general public they have made birdwatching more accessible and easier for people to relate to we have been getting a lot more correspondence from people who are new to the subject but are now hooked
2597936 it has never before been necessary for any organisation to define a word that has been in common every day use so i see no reason why it was necessary on this occasion
2597937 astronomers use adjectives such as giant and dwarf to describe different subclasses of objects like planets stars and galaxies so why could pluto not remain as a dwarf planet just as jupiter is a giant planet
2597938 also around 90 per cent of the planets we know now are outside our solar system but under the international astronomical unions definition they cannot be classed as planets
2597939 on friday he had his first taste of it and you cant get much more of a difficult save than he did
2597940 i was watching their batting practice and anything up they just pounded

2597942 im not sure my role in this game long term is as a closer
2597943 but if i can help our team get a win throw a couple innings and save the rest of the bullpen then ill do whatever i can to help
2597944 out of kash out of kredit and out of klothes
2597945 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2597946 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2597947 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2597948 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2597949 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2597950 they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered
2597951 weve been in contact with leaders in both georgia and russia at all levels of government georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2597952 to ensure stability authorities have strengthened controls on non residents to root out trouble and stepped up controls on key people religious figures and trouble making petitioners to stay abreast of things
2597953 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2597954 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2597955 we are not yet sure how the meetings will go
2597956 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes at the moment there is no clear position
2597957 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2597958 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2597959 it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the beijing olympics
2597960 congo wants to preserve its protected spaces it needs the best expertise if that expertise comes from outside i dont see why we should be reticent we dont have any hang ups in that respect
2597961 im under no illusion over how difficult it is the glimmer of hope is that we have a very strong team of rangers on the ground
2597962 eu n o consigo gostar disso me recuso a vibrar com isso e n o quero ganhar assim mais
2597963 even when hes at home with a dodgy knee tiger woods makes it on to prime time saturday afternoon television in these parts the biggest criticism of american golf coverage apart from the tiresome ad interruptions is its
2597964 padraig harringtons successful defence of the open capped a riveting and at times tempestuous championship at royal birkdale all the talk in the build up was about the absence of tiger woods through injury and if i am honest he was
2597965 well that was fun wasnt it today it was all about the wind as the worlds finest golfers were blown off course by a howling gale that wreaked havoc at royal birkdale no one was able to shoot a round under

2597969 in this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be thankful for as for me i rejoice that i am not a republican
2597970 you have to be able to read into the defensive lineman or linebacker or whoever you are blocking at that time
2597971 you have to be able to read him a little more when you get a quarterback that is sitting in the pocket its pretty easy to guess where he is trying to get to if you have someone that is moving around back there a little bit the defender starts to see things a little differently all of a sudden a guy is trying to get outside of you when the quarterback is normally sitting in the pocket so you have to adjust you have to be ready to read that
2597972 i hope at the end of the season i really do that i feel like i made the right decision
2597973 i hope the jets fans and the people throughout the nfl world feel like i made the right decision at this point i think it was the right decision
2597974 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry

2598019 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2598020 choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay
2598021 we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
2598022 pro choice and pro life people over the semantics of how that is said
2598023 obama and the democrats are trying to craft a message that will be visible to the pro life people in terms of saying that abortion will be reduced but that will be invisible to the pro choice people
2598024 gods politics why the right gets it wrong and the left doesnt get it
2598025 abortion reduction should be a central democratic party plank in this election
2598026 there is a parallelism of choice here in the democratic platform that is a good helpful and new direction that will make many people feel more welcome
2598027 the democratic party is now on record in strongly supporting both a womans right to choose to terminate her pregnancy or to decide to have her child with promised support with the potential common ground of agreeing together for the need to reduce abortions

2598042 in a country where the state is largely neutral on theological matters and where no other similar arrangement exists for other minority faiths such an initiative will inevitably be met with scepticism and mistrust for too long now british muslims have been viewed by this government through the narrow prism of security british muslims like all citizens have every right to peacefully disagree with government policies if they wish and they do not need to be re programmed by a government approved list of theologians
2598043 our disagreement with government is now regarded by some as extremism and we appeal to all reasonable minded people to stand firm in opposing such dictatorial and unhelpful positions the mcb remains committed to work for the common good of the society at large
2598044 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia

2598067 first we learned that the federal budget deficit could reach nearly half a trillion dollars next year eight years after we had a record surplus were now faced with record deficits this mortgaging of our childrens future is a direct result of the bush administrations dangerously failed fiscal policies
2598068 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2598069 instead of helping americans who are struggling weve seen loopholes and lavish giveaways for corporations that ship jobs overseas and tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest americans who dont need them and didnt even ask for them

2598072 though victory in iraq is finally in sight a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president

2598085 every state has been asked to appoint a nodal officer to handle fake currency note cases in coordination with the central investigating agencies
2598086 fake currency is sent from pakistan to nepal and then into bihar and up
2598087 these have obviously been printed in a government press most probably in pakistan
2598088 hmmm thats a good question let me think about that for a second
2598089 im not really sure im going to have to think about that for a bit and get back to you
2598090 im not sure to be honest what do you think
2598091 ive never really considered that perhaps you can expand the question a little and we can explore it right now

2598122 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2598123 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2598124 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2598125 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2598126 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2598127 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2598128 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2598129 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2598130 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2598131 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth

2598135 citi is moving aggressively to help distressed borrowers maintain homeownership
2598136 its important for us to engage as quickly as possible with distressed borrowers to work on solutions citi signed an agreement with naca this year to reduce the interest rates and or the principal balance on certain eligible mortgages of distressed borrowers we service to make them affordable over the long term and through its program naca puts us in touch with some borrowers we might be unable to reach otherwise

2598138 if we pay off all monthly credit card balances used primarily on utilities other monthly expenditures and internet purchases and we get affinity benefits how am i losing money and why are we suckers havent you cast your victim net too widely
2598139 i do not understand your argument that anyone who uses credit cards is a chump even if they pay their balances off in full every month
2598140 i can assure you that i make the same purchases and contributions with credit cards that i would make without them
2598141 essentially this is a loan administered through the tax code

2598146 i was surprised at your advice to the poster who wanted to reduce wedding costs i absolutely agree that people should stick to a wedding budget but i was raised to believe that weddings are not just about the couple but about the families being joined together so the guest list is the last thing to cut not the first
2598147 certain cultures and religions do place a lot of emphasis on family during a wedding celebration
2598148 my family was just appalled at the quaintness of my wedding a lunch with a cocktail hour

2598150 the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased

2598154 the frontier is a classic that continues to please the menu is displayed above the large counter where you place your order once you have decided on your selection from the extensive menu you step up to the next open spot with the blinking green light and tell the very polite man or woman what you want your drinks are served at the counter and you are given a number for the rest of your order select a place to sit in one of the rooms
2598155 a hearty filling breakfast with enough zing to start your day
2598156 the frontier sells six packs of sweet rolls frozen ready to take home and nuke
2598157 with a menu this big it is easy to forget how good the burgers are here this bonanza burger comes dressed with cheese tomato onion lettuce pickle and thousand island dressing
2598158 buried underneath the cheese and fiery green chile are a couple of sunnyside up eggs i mashed my warm tortilla down and sopped up some yolk which was a pretty good damper for the chilies heat the flavor mix of this dish is spectacular rich brilliant exciting and immensely satisfying

2598164 but i do support georgias president mikheil saakashvili and what russia is doing is wrong they must stop
2598165 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2598166 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2598167 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures

2598178 as i was coming home i heard the roar of jets
2598179 i fell to the ground instinctively and then there were these painfully loud bangs
2598180 they were such lovely people they were so excited about the baby
2598181 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2598182 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2598183 there have certainly been a lot of casualties the street next to ours was hit by firing and we saw bodies being taken away we are staying inside the house we have got three young children and they are very frightened
2598184 i went out and saw burnt tanks with dead bodies the police said that they were georgians who had been trying to come into the city then we heard planes and what sounded like firing from helicopters but it is very confusing and we dont know whats really going on
2598185 our peacekeepers and units subordinate to them are now carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to peace

2598197 yesterday i was very mad with my round 78 today i cant believe it i cant believe im here
2598198 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions the wind at the time was a south westerly force 5 7 with a moderate to rough sea state generating a heavy surf
2598199 members of the public entering the sea in these sort of conditions were putting themselves at severe risk no matter how commendable were their intentions
2598200 you want to improve every season i know i do anyway and having a taste of success winning the cup was a lift for everybody connected with the club
2598201 improving on eighth is achievable we might have done better last time but let it slip away having had that experience it shouldnt happen again
2598202 its up to the chairman and the powers that be to decide if the money is there for harry redknapp to buy more players but with the extra commitment in europe we need everybody to stay fit and two or three more players besides in the future we need a new training ground and a new stadium for portsmouth to move on to the next level we could easily pull crowds of 35 000 if we had the capacity
2598203 fourth spot is the loosest one in the top four a lot of teams could get it
2598204 we could have an amazing season and sneak in there if we kick on after last season theres a lot of guys here who have been winners and they want to keep on winning thats what progress is all about changing the mentality of the players and the club
2598205 the gaffer has done a fantastic job here bringing in good players and assembling an ever improving team
2598206 hes very good at man management knows how to treat the guys and lets them get on with their jobs sometimes he does get angry if were not playing well but man management is an art and hes a master at it youd be surprised some managers havent got a clue about it
2598207 the team that loses the shield often seems to win the league you cant attach too much importance to one game at the start of the season youve got to wait until christmas to assess where you are as a team
2598208 crouch has given us another dimension good in the air as well as on the ground and its nice to have two players causing the opposition problems
2598209 im 33 but im strong and feeling good so why not ive not retired from international football i want to keep going you never know
2598210 winning the fa cup may have helped before that probably a lot of people looked at portsmouth and thought nothings happening there all of a sudden that has changed and something is growing here im sure fabio capello will be keeping an eye on us among others
2598211 under the new manager instead of just having a good team he wants a strong squad and id like to be part of that
2598212 if at the end of three years local government has not delivered on those building blocks i think there will be some really big questions to be asked about its capacity to commission these services in the future
2598213 we have been concerned about councils being in charge of assessing peoples needs and then deciding how much should be spent on them there have been concerns about the quality of care offered to older people in particular at least threatening local authorities with sanctions if they do not improve can be of benefit
2598214 councils are best placed to make decisions on providing care and support to local people thanks to their knowledge of whats available in each area and how best it can be managed

2598218 the price might seem low but the reality is many of us have held the stock in the expectation of a bid there dont seem to be many other obvious counterbidders and the management has underperformed wed like more but equally we know the share price would fall if xstrata walk away we dont want this
2598219 we conclude that a bill of rights and freedoms should not include directly enforceable duties

2598221 my caddie said you know youve got to hit the shot
2598222 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2598223 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2598224 people want to sell on anything or buy on anything
2598225 strengthening in the dollar is a good thing not only for business but also to build back confidence both domestically and internationally
2598226 we have unrealistic expectations for people john edwards like the rest of us is only human
2598227 the truth is a lot of ordinary average americans have affairs
2598228 the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2598229 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2598230 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention
2598231 i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2598232 there are people who feel let down when you invest that much time and energy in a candidate and the candidate turns out to be less than you thought
2598233 the american public has become sensitised to this type of behaviour from political leaders
2598234 he should get off the political stage our staff put their faith and confidence in him and he let them down

2598239 do you think that people realize that the stimulus package a k a tax refund really counts against their 2008 return

2598249 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2598250 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2598251 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty
2598252 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2598253 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
2598254 four people who entered the site are now in police custody and police are dealing with a number of other people who are trying to get in
2598255 hes got quite a few contacts in the hutt valley area and its still possible that he may well be with one of them but thats a little bit uncertain
2598256 obviously as time goes on the more concern there is
2598257 he really takes the whole hands on dad thing seriously
2598258 you dont like seeing your party in that situation it was a body blow for all of us and that acts as a motivator
2598259 i knew this is a life changing job for my family and myself and i had to be sure that all the bases were sorted out
2598260 to have your wife at your launch is not an unusual thing to do
2598261 there were key stages in making the decision to stand and that squaring it with family life was the first key stage once it was made we took it from there
2598262 he hates nothing more than people saying hes another jack
2598263 undermining the very institution the scottish parliament that we the labour party created in 1999
2598264 the challenge we face in scotland is different to the challenge in the rest of the uk
2598265 the politics of scotland are different to the rest of the uk devolution has changed forever the face of scottish politics we need that strong scottish voice so people understand that labour in scotland is advocating for them their values and how they see their future and their country
2598266 we need to understand this new climate we work in i still strongly believe that we are the natural party for scotland we have just lost our way disconnected with people they have not seen us advocating for themselves their families and their country
2598267 we ran a completely different health service than the rest of the uk we were first in the smoking ban because we wanted to do that its not as if were hog tied to uk labour in everything we do
2598268 in terms of the whats the right phraseology the decision making process we need to develop more of our own way of doing things in scotland because the voters in kent and kilmarnock are different the voters north and south in terms of labour values are different we need to reflect that
2598269 the political sign off and the control of that campaign should rest with those closest to the issues
2598270 john reid said nothing to me directly about the smoking ban i knew his views because i heard them
2598271 we are taking on a very interesting challenge in mr salmond and the person who does that has to have the political skills the wherewithal the policy and the ideas and the vision to do that and i believe that is delivered by enhancing the role of the scottish leader
2598272 every night i went to bed knowing i had made the right decision
2598273 ministers and politicians are there to weigh up the evidence and look at what is best and i still strongly believe i will be proven to be correct around the need to decentralise emergency care but also to specialise
2598274 the danger is that the nhs doesnt survive the danger is that people lose confidence in the nhs because the services that they expect cannot be delivered
2598275 i am in no doubt that it is an extremely difficult job to do
2598276 what i would say is remember where cameron was and is now where brown was and is now these situations can be reversed brown can reverse it cameron can go down and salmond can go down as well and i intend to make sure that salmond goes down
2598277 when alex salmond tries to tell people that hes somehow more scottish than us than me i will tell him i am every bit as scottish as he is and every bit as proud he may claim to stand up for scotland but he stands for an agenda that would send scotland backwards
2598278 makes acceptable soundbites but whose record in office reflects lack of commitment to labour ideals
2598279 it was brave of andy kerr to take such a step the ban will save thousands of lives
2598280 while i dont mean to cause jeanes family additional grief an attorneys first duty is to his client and jeane was very clear with me that if she was ever found dead of an apparent suicide i was to make sure that all the evidence was publicly disseminated so that it could be independently evaluated

2598283 while i dont mean to cause jeanes family additional grief an attorneys first duty is to his client and jeane was very clear with me that if she was ever found dead of an apparent suicide i was to make sure that all the evidence was publicly disseminated so that it could be independently evaluated
2598284 in many respects i cant wait to get into court and get this monkey off my back this case has gone on far too long

2598286 attorney dc madam left instructions if ever found dead of apparent suicide
2598287 that makes it clear that the targets of the russian military were not only georgian economic objects but international objects on georgian territory
2598288 while the implication is impressive 10 times as many scientists question global warming what stossel didnt tell abc viewers were the significant qualitative differences between the two petitions the first petition was circulated by the well respected union of concerned scientists and signed by 110 nobel laureates the second petition was a response organized by industry affiliated groups that included dentists nutritionists and others with no expertise in climatology the only alleged requirement for signing on was a bachelors degree in science for a time the screening process was so lax that the list included a number of gag names like ginger spice and michael j fox added by environmentalists
2598289 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter

2598301 bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2598302 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2598303 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2598304 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2598305 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2598306 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2598307 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2598308 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try

2598451 we would want to maximise the value of pike river which is still being de risked

2598453 the knowledge of good and evil kills us by distracting us from the one who is the source of life the tree of life jesus
2598454 i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly
2598455 the primary goal of those of us who have been given free life is simply to be as alive as we truly are and to tell those who lack life where to find it

2598467 if you go back three years to the first time i met norman he kicked me out of his office saying come back with a better idea
2598468 its always challenging when a technologist meets an entrepreneur of the calibre of dr norman evans but i have nothing but enormous respect for the man
2598469 i wanted to know if i could walk the walk as well as have an opinion
2598470 were three quarters of the way through a funding round at the moment which should take us through to trading profitably at the rate weve projected
2598471 its not as easy as operating out of somewhere like auckland but theres something about working outside of that that gives you a more grounded view
2598472 you have to be leaner and work harder but there are huge benefits in terms of cost of living for our team the environment and our ability to attract outstanding developers
2598473 im trying to stay as close as possible to the icehouse because the work weve done with andy has been incredible
2598474 a couple of weeks ago i had an interesting meeting with 20 ceos of incubator companies at the icehouse i was the only one who put the experience of fundraising in the exceptional side of the matrix everyone else had found it frustrating
2598475 we are hoping that what they have said about having their loan book secured by first mortgages is true but we have seen all this before
2598476 we have been pounding the trustee for the last three weeks with inquiries to find out what is going on but not receiving a huge amount of help
2598477 if it was an offer for 100 of their money back we would agree up front
2598478 we found them extremely easy to deal with in the negotiations to get the facility we needed easier than it would have been with a new zealand bank and they could comprehend the project better
2598479 they bos set you up to succeed by asking what you need making sure youve got what you need and that you are not tight and that you can get there
2598480 they look at our programmes and make sure we have the financial muscle to do what we need to do they often look at it and say we dont think thats enough we think you are going to need to do this and this and theyve been right so theyve helped us a lot by making sure that we dont short change ourselves in the process of doing what weve said were going to do
2598481 they say ok this is what youve asked for and this is what we are going to give you
2598482 theres a lot more checking of the work and where the moneys spent than with a new zealand bank every month theyve got representatives visiting their site and they come to project meetings theres a very rigid process for releasing funds
2598483 they bos are very very thorough and a lot more rigorous than other banks or finance companies weve dealt with
2598484 theres new information coming out every day about problems coming out in all parts of the world and no one knows whats going to hap pen next
2598485 and i suppose what thats done is just put some negative sentiment in the marketplace and its going to take some time and some positive news to change that
2598486 private investors have a free run at the market at the moment in australia cashed up private investors have the market to themselves
2598487 it made a lot of sense to talk to him and from the moment we met him we got on very well
2598488 he has outstanding qualities and infratil wouldnt be where it is today without his support
2598489 but he reached the big league with his astute buying of water company shares in the early days of privatisation
2598490 things are always very complex around him but he is an astute restructurer and probably the smartest guy on a sustained basis that i have ever known sometimes a little too smart
2598491 clearly an astute and intelligent man and a very good businessman
2598492 he has high integrity hes totally reliable and i cant speak highly enough of him
2598493 people dont understand he is very good at managing every risk he takes
2598494 he doesnt have a perfect track record but its a bit like looking at a piece of swiss cheese its got holes in it but the cheese is made that way
2598495 we try and learn from them before we find new ways of making them
2598496 duncan stepped up straight away and later when we felt more comfortable we asked if we could buy him out of those investments and that happened
2598497 so he has just been there allowing us to do things we couldnt otherwise do
2598498 hes a self made man who knows a huge amount about utilities and is vastly more experienced than we are internationally but we are stronger than him operationally
2598499 litmus test for the credibility of the eu and nato
2598500 i have to tell him to relax more than the other guys
2598501 when he has a whacked out at bat he really tries too hard the next time too he swung at some balls and was just putting too much pressure on himself
2598502 you wont have to ever tell him to hustle i think
2598503 since we had ellsbury ninth and drew first rather than have our fastest guy get stuck behind our catcher well do this
2598504 and if they want to bring in a lefty it seems to make some sense
2598505 i know theres been a lot of times hell come back to the bench even on a ball that wasnt a hit and hell say i feel better which is good hes taking some better passes more consistent sometimes guys as cold as they get they get just as hot
2598506 you know what i think is hard for david is he expects to be in form now even though everybody else is in form
2598507 the pitchers theyre where theyre at the hitters theyre into the grind of the season and hes not thats ok well live with that if he stays at it and he does what hes supposed to do youre going to look up and hes going to do what he does you just have to stay with him and let him do it

2598516 beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them otherwise you have no reward with your father who is in heaven

2598523 this bailout is robbing u s citizens in that it is taking from the american citizenry hard earned tax dollars to bail out the risky adventures of mortgage lenders which does nothing more than further inflation
2598524 it erodes the buying power of the dollar it takes from the american taxpayer that which they earned and that which they have invested into the sound economy of our country
2598525 and in the end it will just continue to fuel the economic meltdown
2598526 a military commission of inquiry has been set up and all those implicated in this attempted coup are being questioned to shed light on this affair
2598527 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2598528 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2598529 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

2598532 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2598533 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2598534 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2598535 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2598545 poor you it must be awful to be such a horrible wretched scum as you are
2598546 the possibility that empathy resides in parts of the brain so ancient that we share them with rats should give pause to anyone comparing politicians with those poor underestimated creatures

2598557 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2598558 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2598559 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2598560 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2598561 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2598562 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2598563 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2598564 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2598565 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2598566 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection

2598573 i have received information that sri lanka police personnel and sri lanka army sla soldiers were involved in several white van abductions reluctance of the inspector general of police igp and other law enforcement officials to take timely steps to investigate these crimes is clear evidence of widespread violations of human rights and breakdown of law and order
2598574 tamil people are facing daunting challenges complex existential difficulties and mental trauma due to escalating abductions disappearances and arbitrary arrests the number of detainees held in the jails boosa detention camp and in the 401 police stations across sri lanka by the terrorism investigating divisions tid criminal investigation division cid and the police are creating conditions leading to egregious human rights violations
2598575 neither our alliance with the government nor the fear of losing our positions of power will force us to remain silent when tamils rights are violated by the security forces
2598576 more than 30 upcountry youths have been arbitrarily arrested in piliyandala and weliveriya areas every tamil must be fully cognizant of the attempt by some politicians to paint upcountry tamils as supporters of liberation tigers

2598585 generally productivity output rises rapidly from the start of a career to a peak and then declines gradually until retirement
2598586 those who are precocious also tend to display longevity and both precocity and longevity are positively associated with high output rates per age unit
2598587 everything thats already in the world when youre born is just normal anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it anything that gets invented after youre thirty is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until its been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright really apply this list to movies rock music word processors and mobile phones to work out how old you are

2598590 so heres my first challenge to anyone who has an opinion on the role of age and entrepreneurship see if you can fit your opinion into this model
2598591 and heres my second challenge is entrepreneurship more like poetry pure mathematics and theoretical physics which exhibit a peak age in ones late 20s or early 30s or novel writing history philosophy medicine and general scholarship which exhibit a peak age in ones late 40s or early 50s and how and why
2598592 modern entrepreneurship especially web entrepreneurship is extremely competitive time sensitive requires enormous amounts of iteration even within a single product life cycle and often requires solving many challenging technical and business problems one after the other in a public view with the opposite sex watching so it favors the young and single
2598593 is entrepreneurship more like poetry pure mathematics and theoretical physics which exhibit a peak age in ones late 20s or early 30s or novel writing history philosophy medicine and general scholarship which exhibit a peak age in ones late 40s or early 50s and how and why
2598594 vcs are ageing entrepreneurs whove learned to outsource their creativity

2598726 we are looking at every possibility and making sure that we have prepared for every conceivable contingency if someone is threatening violence we will go to great lengths to deal with that
2598727 people on these racist and white supremacist websites are being quite careful because they know that if they make a threat they will very likely get a visit from the secret service
2598728 the scary thing out there is the lone wolf phenomenon there are enough crazy people in this movement that it is possible one of them will decide today is the day to kick off the aryan revolution
2598729 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking
2598730 the government should be supporting many other organisations who are also vying for the governments attention we dont have anything against the sif but it isnt wise to throw so much money at this organisation people are very upset about it
2598731 providing every document detailed on the rrri application form is not a mandatory requirement of securing grant funding like every other one of the 33 organisations that won funding they provided sufficient information for the process of independent evaluation led by officials to take place
2598732 heres a kid thats so squeaky clean lets see how we can scandalize anything she does
2598733 this shows that there needs to be far more robust checks in place within local government over expenses they now exist in the scottish parliament but there is no real scrutiny being placed on councils this needs to be looked at and examined properly
2598734 its fair to say when we saw charlies claims there were a few eyebrows raised to put it mildly
2598735 spoken to councillor cefferty about his abnormally high mileage says he has a large area to cover and is working 13 hours a day
2598736 i have nothing to hide i have a lot of miles because i do lots of house visits thats a brand new car and its done 7 000 miles in three months i am renowned for the amount of work i do
2598737 my ward was enlarged to three times the size in may last year and since then everybody wants to speak to you they phone up all the councillors and play them one against each other and i want to be there first
2598738 i only do the work that i do and i dont claim for anything outwith the work i do in the past i have claimed probably 40 less than the miles i do
2598739 in the daytime at weekends and even in the early hours of the morning
2598740 when i do my house visits its not a milk round you cant see people in one particular area all together im a reactive councillor so i go where im needed
2598741 im in the civic centre most evenings because i have got peace and quiet there but i dont go to all the meetings because sometimes you are more productive by doing constituency work im a constituency councillor
2598742 my wife runs the pub and i am a partner in that pub i have to have an income its only recently they have started to pay councillors properly my car isnt paid by the council its paid for by my business
2598743 i dont get involved in council politics for any self gain i get driven by whats happening in the community thats why i get re elected if wee jeannie needs something done charlie cefferty goes and does it
2598744 i am going to try and have better time management and work from home more in my office because at the moment i dont have any spare time
2598745 councillors expenses are subject to regular and periodic audits as part of the normal internal and external audit arrangements beyond publishing annually the details of such expenses the council would not consider it appropriate to comment on individual claims
2598746 young people are thinking its acceptable fashionable necessary for them to protect themselves to carry a knife just like we made guns unacceptable we should make knives unacceptable
2598747 you need not just young people but parents and other people to say that knives in britain like guns like bullying like racism all these things are unacceptable we have to persuade people its not a thing government can do only people in the community have got to in a sense rise up and say this is unacceptable behaviour
2598748 there are certain boundaries in a decent society you dont cross and these boundaries are cultural because in america it is acceptable for many people to carry guns its not in britain i think in britain weve got to make it as unacceptable to carry knives i think most decent people in our country would want to do that and i think what you will see over the next few months is this sort of campaign which is led not just by government but people in the country to say get knives off our streets its completely unacceptable

2598772 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2598773 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there in los angeles the clubs would have a black night people would say why dont you come by and do something i would say im a comedian dont put a title on me dont limit yourself how you start is how you finish

2598780 the uk government is deeply concerned by the violence in georgia
2598781 the escalation in fighting is dangerously destabilising and there is also the threat of civilian losses on a large scale
2598782 reports of fighting and bombing outside south ossetia are especially disturbing as they represent a broadening and deepening of the conflict
2598783 the uk believes it is vital for leaderships on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2598784 the uk will be discussing with all our partners how to stop the spread of violence secure a ceasefire and get talks under way
2598785 georgia has been attacked by a formidable force it is a brutal attack with the use of air force tanks and even the trademark cyber attack
2598786 america has spoken candidly and consistently about our concerns over the chinese governments behaviour we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2598787 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century

2598791 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2598792 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2598793 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2598794 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2598795 descended into a state of deep depression anxiety and emotional paralysis
2598796 i had no job and i was in such a bad way that i was operating at some pretty primal survival level
2598797 remember how they did those experiments on baby monkeys where they put them in wire cages with fur around the wire and every time they wanted to be nurtured they got hit thats what it felt like to be in this relationship
2598798 the team leader frequently referred to my weight and physical characteristics and i became increasingly isolated and tearful
2598799 i kind of lost respect for my profession i found that the kind people were few and far between i was trying to do the best for people
2598800 there is a very judgemental part of the profession and the fact that i was president of the society kind of made it more exciting for them to oust me
2598801 i think i kept on trying because he was so hurt by life he was so charming at first he could be so beautiful so spiritual he cooked for me and at times he was caring we talked of love and a relationship he asked me to marry him
2598802 he knew all the right things to say and i used to believe him until i would get this icy blast of reality
2598803 he threatened to stab me in the heart he punched me in the head
2598804 they want him in the ocean they thought he was going to kill me and they didnt want to come to my tangi but they dont realise i still have incredible feelings for him
2598805 i was angry at her for calling the police because it resulted in him being put in jail for breaching his parole conditions but she had to do something
2598806 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2598807 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2598808 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2598809 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2598810 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2598811 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2598812 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2598813 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2598814 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2598815 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2598816 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2598817 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2598818 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2598819 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2598820 given the absence of wood in the miserable tv3 building i allow myself to touch a wood product ie paper because im usually carrying scripts im covered
2598821 sometimes i leave it at home and it feels really odd to do the show without it
2598822 i had lucky silks lucky sticks i always put my right boot on first i always folded the the tags on my towels inwards
2598823 i had a mad mother i was brought up with things like never put shoes on the table even when theyre new i still do those things
2598824 a kind of voice in my head that said he was going to die which he did within a day or two weird
2598825 when the sceptics conference opened on year on a friday 13th we had a ladder parked over the entrance doorway and everyone came through under it we also had a box of mirror glass to break chain mail letters to ignore salt to spill umbrellas to open inside it was the one onference where all the speakers ran to time
2598826 for cultural reasons and often because the money is collected for a good cause
2598827 i got to the point of thinking that being told to be wary of someone simply because they were a scorpio was as distasteful as being told to be wary of samoans or jews
2598828 whoever looks on a woman to lust for her has committed adultery with her already in his heart
2598829 little phrases that can help you feel secure is dismissing common sense
2598830 im not going to have to worry about him because somebody else down south is going to take him out if that man is elected president hell be shot sure as hell the hate would be so deep down south
2598831 the kkk or someone will assassinate obama if we get a n president all you n s sic will think youve won and that the white people will have to bow to you f that
2598832 we are looking at every possibility and making sure that we have prepared for every conceivable contingency if someone is threatening violence we will go to great lengths to deal with that
2598833 people on these racist and white supremacist websites are being quite careful because they know that if they make a threat they will very likely get a visit from the secret service
2598834 the scary thing out there is the lone wolf phenomenon there are enough crazy people in this movement that it is possible one of them will decide today is the day to kick off the aryan revolution
2598835 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking
2598836 right now we are managing but it is a very difficult situation
2598837 ive never experienced anything like this weve drilled our mountains full of holes looking for water this situation will have a long term impact on our flora and fauna
2598838 syrias election to the board while under investigation for secretly building an undeclared nuclear reactor not suited for peaceful purposes would make a mockery
2598839 the syrians said that a visit at this time was inopportune
2598840 the population of south ossetia is 75 000 and our camps in darfur have 150 000 people in one camp so it should be relatively straightforward
2598841 right now its very unclear what access is allowed into south ossetia if we cannot get in we will have to focus on people that are leaving the area because if its a hostile environment access will be restricted even if we do get in i dont know how easy it is for us to move around
2598842 if it stays confined in south ossetia it is probably quite manageable from a humanitarian point of view but if the conflict does move to involve abkhazia another separatist area of georgia or if it causes a destabilisation of the government we could be looking at a much longer and more serious situation
2598843 there is nervousness among our people on the ground that the conflict will spread to tbilisi which would make it much more serious people are surprised by the degree of engagement by the russians
2598844 there will be four or five people singing with music about god
2598845 there was a slight safety risk for women wearing normal bras with metal parts underneath a bullet proof vest
2598846 if the vest is hit by a projectile this can have an impact on the metal bit in the bra underneath and cause injuries
2598847 they said we should go smoke some weed and were talking about being in a strip bar some really explicit things
2598848 on elviss side and on my side too i have twin brothers and then of course elvis had a twin brother who died at birth
2598849 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2598850 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and my core beliefs i recognised my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2598851 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2598852 is going to meet the principals basically to advertisement update them on the progress so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2598853 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2598854 the june 4 suspension of humanitarian operations is estimated to have affected more than 1 5 million zimbabweans already this years poor harvest means that 5 million zimbabweans will face a severe food crisis if the ban is not lifted
2598855 we are concerned that more than two weeks after the signing of the memorandum of understanding and despite our diplomatic appeals we have seen no concrete steps taken to carry out this commitment

2598858 russia is fond of saying georgia is in our backyard
2598859 but its reasonable to ask what difference does that make these nations are independent countries that have the right to chart their own future
2598860 russia has resented this break up of the old soviet union
2598861 they have been looking for an opportunity to wean people back
2598862 summerland le foto di gabri da porto pino sud sardegna
2598863 we also demand that the united nations and international society do not ignore the nuclear weapons of north korea pakistan and israel as well as the suspicions of nuclear development by iran but take stern measures against these countries
2598864 india whose nuclear cooperation with the us is a concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2598865 the bottom line for us is this is the way to get the cooperation we want this is the way to get the support for non proliferation
2598866 gori is the staging post for the georgian military heading towards the front in south ossetia
2598867 on saturday morning we were talking to and filming a number of very fresh faced looking georgian recruits called up as part of president saakashvilis full mobilisation of the military on friday
2598868 they looked relaxed and calm all of a sudden the sound of a warplane was heard overhead and there was a huge explosion not too far away
2598869 they scattered like flies they didnt know what to do these men were not hardened troops by any manner of means
2598870 there were cars driving in all directions carrying the injured
2598871 we got reports from witnesses and civilians that outside villages had also been hit
2598872 we have seen a number of russian aerial strikes throughout the morning they have certainly hit a georgian military installation
2598873 we cant tell how many casualties are inside it is blocked off there is a munitions depot inside and there are shells exploding
2598874 we have seen a number of injured civilians being led away we have seen elderly people being led away we have seen families heading out of gori fearing the worst and heading towards tbilisi and hoping they will find some sort of the safety there
2598875 the battle lines in this conflict are becoming extremely ugly they are no longer just inside south ossetia russia has been making air incursions into georgian territory
2598876 soldiers have been running through the streets as well as civilians fleeing for safety
2598877 we saw the impact of the air strikes and we have also seen that the russians missed their targets at least once and hit a residential apartment block
2598878 two buildings are on fire with civilians inside we saw at least one man pulled out dead and were told that a number of people were killed or injured
2598879 there are claims from the georgian side that several georgian military bases were bombed by russian aircraft and a port in the south of the country on the black sea coast a long way from gori
2598880 clearly the russians are choosing a lot of targets around the country
2598881 the planes are bombing us i am sitting here in the basement fire is raging above us let somebody come and help us where are the peacekeepers i am sitting here with other people
2598882 my son has been killed why does nobody come to save us
2598883 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined building in cars
2598884 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2598885 and when their roosts are disrupted or their normal prey grow scarce homo sapiens become a pretty easy meal
2598886 that leads in my case and i would think in other cases as well to people saying well lets just not reinsulate the roof
2598887 we have no problem with the use of solar energy
2598888 marburg is already a leader when it comes to the use of solar energy but up until now theyve always tried to convince people rather than forcing them
2598889 its unfortunate that they decided to compel people because i think you breed opponents that way rather than friends of solar energy
2598890 we have a serious energy problem with the older homes
2598891 before solar installations were the exception and their absence was the rule
2598892 we want to get to the point where the opposite is the case
2598893 he passed away from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2598894 i just didnt have any more strength in the legs
2598895 i had a terrible headache i dont know where it came from probably the pollution

2598897 ive never ever played in worse humidity than this these are extreme conditions
2598898 its hard to adapt but you cant cry and look for excuses
2598899 its within the power of our officiating team to take measures in case the situation is reaching an unacceptable level
2598900 the conditions are not the best but our players are very strong what is important is the health of the player the position now is that the health of the players is not at risk but each sport has some flexibility by the ioc

2598913 unbutton the collar of journalism and have a little fun asking the questions that may not meet traditional journalistic standards but that are on the minds of the citizens
2598914 no one knows what issues are most important for americans except the citizens themselves
2598915 citizen journalism is a way to attract individual thoughts and feelings on the issues not collective opinions

2598920 right now i realize what i have im world champion last time i didnt really realize what i had in my hand now i know what it is and i dont want to lose it im going to fight to win im not going to fight not to lose im going for the finish
2598921 i feel this is a great challenge not only because i am fighting who i think is the most dangerous guy i have fought so far but also because last year almost a year and a half to the day i lost my first title defense now i have a chance to redeem myself where i can succeed where i failed last time
2598922 because of the way i came up in the ufc people didnt see a lot of my fights
2598923 people develop an attachment to fighters that they see fight live
2598924 a lot of fans still dont know who i am and havent developed that kind of attachment or an appreciation for me its just the way things go we have a stacked weight division and i kind of slipped through the cracks
2598925 my wrestling opens up the ability for me to stand because guys must respect the fact that i can take them down it makes it easier to hit them
2598926 theyre so worried about getting taken down that it opens up my stand up game a lot more
2598927 the confidence doesnt come from my athleticism it comes from my mixed martial arts background and also from my trainers and training partners
2598928 thats what i believe but there is only one way to find out and we will find out aug 9
2598929 when we initially left we got to the lights and i said to him have you still got the piece with you he said no
2598930 so we drove back got the piece delivered him to the hospital and they reattached it
2598931 he was losing a bit of blood as you do with the nerves that run into the tips of your fingers i made sure he was well and he was looked after
2598932 they were really helpful and pleasant and kept the guy calm
2598933 just done what anyone else would do which is pretty much help someone who needed a bit of help
2598934 we conclude that a bill of rights and freedoms should not include directly enforceable duties
2598935 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
2598936 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups

2598944 our staffers were tired and were trying to sleep but some of the guests were drinking on the roof and making a lot of noise around 1 am a couple of our boys tried to pacify the excited guests and explained to them that they needed to retire to their rooms this did not go down well with the inebriated men and they got into a heated argument
2598945 they were drunk abusive and defiant when the fight broke out one of them dialled those staying in the two other hotels and summoned them we also called up the local hotel staff who go home every night but we were too few to challenge the drunken lot
2598946 sir please come here quickly theyve thrown prasun off the roof

2598950 a maioria de seus f s lembrar que pagou para ver bernie mac e ele mac fez com que valesse a pena
2598951 estou em estado de choque ele era t o cheio de vida
2598952 hoje um dia muito triste para muitos que conheceram e amaram bernie
2598953 desde o in cio eu achava que ele estava destinado para o sucesso ele nunca se esqueceu de suas origens e geralmente usava experi ncias reais de sua vida em sua rotina de trabalho para ele sua fam lia era a coisa mais importante do mundo
2598954 its part of the governments overall crime fighting strategy were absolutely committed to this its one of the focal points of this government
2598955 i think theres quite a bit of room for us to move

2598957 i think debate should be the norm rather than the exception and this is just an unusual situation
2598958 as long as he still represents his constituents and he has policies in place that people want to vote for im fine without the drama of the debate
2598959 its a medical condition and we cant just get rid of someone because theyve had a medical problem
2598960 i think south dakotans in general understand hes not able to express himself as clearly as he would like to
2598961 if hes not willing to debate i feel he shouldnt be in the election i feel he should pull out
2598962 i think debates are healthy so i would encourage him to re consider
2598963 how can he really stand up for the people of south dakota which he is elected to do if hes not willing to get out there
2598964 well obama was born in 1961 so technically hes a baby boomer
2598965 we issued the birth certificate signed by civic bodys chief officer on friday evening and it was sent to the ivf centre at midnight by hand
2598966 we had not issued the birth certificate so far as we were waiting for guidelines from gandhinagar on the legality issues the issue was complicated as the baby technically has three mothers ex wife of the babys biological father dr ikufumi yamada the egg donor and the surrogate mother and we had no experience of issuing a birth certificate in such cases but now the certificate has been issued stating only the biological fathers name
2598967 we had received the certificate friday night and we sent it to jaipur through courier on saturday morning now it will be easy for the biological father to get a passport issued in manjis name as he also has parental rights
2598968 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2598969 tactical battalions have completely liberated tskhinvali from georgian military forces
2598970 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2598971 its been a boatload of money to put it colloquially
2598972 the public needs to appreciate how seriously we took the 70 vote for jessicas law and public safety
2598973 was it like a crisis yes anybody who was willing to take on evaluations at any time and in any place could literally work around the clock
2598974 they were just saying take them take them take them
2598975 its not wimpy to avoid putting a gop bumper sticker on your car your car cant protect itself from left wing loons who see vandalism as an acceptable form of political expression
2598976 donate 100 and get a free t shirt donate 250 and get a free duffel bag
2598977 donate 500 and get hate mail from a complete nozzle suitable for framing
2598978 this idea sounds even more sloppily thought out than his last venture which of course went belly up for lack of financial support
2598979 well hollywoods all about money they just make what sells
2598980 i understand why the republicans think they have that issue but the vast majority of the american people blame george bush and the oil companies for high gas prices
2598981 so i think that is an issue that ultimately will not help them

2598994 we have unrealistic expectations for people john edwards like the rest of us is only human
2598995 the truth is a lot of ordinary average americans have affairs
2598996 weve got one of the ablest candidates ever nominated and hes running against a man who really pretty much promises more of the same of what weve had the last eight years
2598997 i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2598998 the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2598999 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2599000 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention
2599001 obviously a lot of people believed in john edwards people were passionate about his candidacy i think there are people who feel let down when you invest that much time and energy in a candidate and the candidate turns out to be less than you thought
2599002 the american public has become sensitised to this type of behaviour from political leaders

2599007 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2599008 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2599009 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2599010 i have never been an expert on anything i have spent my life going from place to place always in a hurry watching other people do things and writing and talking about what they are doing

2599016 i was diagnosed when i was 13 with photosensitive epilepsy sensitivity to light after having three seizures
2599017 it is triggered by flickering lights tv screens computers etc
2599018 it is like i am having a bit like a day dream but you come back really quickly
2599019 when you come back it is like somebody has switched the light back on i can be talking to somebody and all of a sudden they can be saying something different and i havent got a clue what they have been saying i can be very confused
2599020 i have had near misses crossing roads and i burnt myself ironing at home once so i dont iron any more
2599021 when i was younger someone had to sit with me when i was in the bath now i am older i take a shower
2599022 i dont cook alone there needs to be someone there
2599023 the websites and leaflets i had growing up were very negative about it i found there are ways of doing things not everything was restricted
2599024 i was told i could never swim or travel alone i was told i could never do anything alone
2599025 i do not get a lot of time alone most of my time is spent with people but i have taken up surfing and can do this provided there are people around
2599026 of course there are things that you cant do but there are things you can
2599027 it gives voice to young people with epilepsy and presents their real experiences learning from others in a similar situation can bring so much hope and encouragement and above all young people with epilepsy can see that they are not alone
2599028 there is a lot of information out there but young people find it difficult to find the information about their particular type of epilepsy there is such a range they found it difficult to see what applied to them
2599029 there was also a lack of awareness in the ways it could affect their lives
2599030 epilepsy is a much misunderstood condition which is still often highly stigmatised a diagnosis can have a dramatic impact on every aspect of a persons life
2599031 this site allows young people who are sometimes quite isolated by the condition to gain an insight into how other young people with epilepsy are feeling and how they are dealing with situations in their lives
2599032 it is obvious that there has been a strong swing against the government
2599033 i have listened to that swing i will listen to what territorians said i take responsibility for the campaign
2599034 i believe in the principles that sit behind this side of politics
2599035 we rest on principles good principles and those principles when followed through can and will make a huge difference

2599053 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2599054 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2599055 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2599056 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a cease fire
2599057 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on nonuse of force with south ossetians
2599058 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2599059 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia
2599060 regrettably i have come to the conclusion it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground in the council on a draft statement to the press
2599061 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2599062 a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2599063 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2599075 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2599076 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2599077 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2599078 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2599079 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2599080 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2599081 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that

2599086 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2599087 that seems like so long ago it seems like a dream
2599088 im not going to sit here and tell you that ive got this offense down that i know every guy in the locker room or they know me
2599089 its a routine and im just kind of following them thats different for me
2599090 i was really surprised that today i was as effective as i was and im not saying that that was good
2599091 im just saying i was able to take a snap call a play we were able to break a huddle and i was able to complete passes in some sort of rhythm
2599092 all the rumors about him throwing hard yeah theyre true
2599093 i came here as a kid and there were always a few people here and there but nothing like this
2599094 anytime you have a chance to get a guy like brett favre youve got to go get him
2599095 now with him theyre going to go at least 10 6
2599096 of course i and this team would come out being victorious
2599097 i hope at the end of this season i really do that i feel like i made the right decision i hope the jets fans and the people throughout the nfl world feel like i made the right decision at this point i think it was the right decision id love to win the super bowl i wouldve loved to have gone and won it last year as i said yesterday and the day before my intentions are to help this team win
2599098 how do you tell brett favre to adapt to you
2599099 hes trying to learn everybodys name trying to figure out where the cafeteria is and the dorm rooms and all that other stuff
2599100 theres nothing for me to do than try to get this offense down
2599101 get acclimated with the guys the system and that will take awhile and thatll be tough
2599102 im two weeks behind as far as practice and im also 38 years old so im a little bit behind there too
2599103 my arm feels fine itll be tired tomorrow and itll be sore because theres no substitute for getting into game type situations and putting the pads on
2599104 i didnt want to look too bad so i tried to put as much into it as i could and ill pay for it tomorrow but ill be ok
2599105 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2599106 but there is tons of prep work that has to be done to pull it off thats what takes the most time
2599107 i brought my referee shirt just in case i have to fill in
2599108 i get a chuckle every time i hear the radio ads for the event
2599109 but i wouldnt miss this for anything basketball is definitely a big draw its fun to watch i find myself coaching from the sidelines it gives me a lot of ideas for the season
2599110 the boys and girls club used to be the southside community center which hosted a block party when i was growing up in madison
2599111 they stopped doing the block party around 1999 there wasnt a party for two years until i decided to take it over and bring it back
2599112 the more positive activities like this that we can have at penn park the better
2599113 the police department supports this activity normally we charge the organizers of an event a fee for providing crowd control but were trying to make sure there are activities in the park and that people feel safe and secure
2599114 this is a multicultural event with something for all ages its a good time
2599115 its good for the community people tell me we need to do something like this at warner park and at elver park too
2599116 i grew up in monona and my brother was a big basketball player i remember him getting a team out here
2599117 i think its an awesome event i love basketball this is a great event for the neighborhood and community
2599118 i work for centro hispano for fiesta hispana and the association for africa fest i dont care what culture or ethic group it is people learn they take a little bit away from the experience
2599119 an event like this makes a big impact on the kids it gets them learning about everybody else its a great community event
2599120 im just here enjoying seeing somebody else work and experience the atmosphere
2599121 i know johnny winston jr and a lot of other people who are volunteering their time we all go to each others events to support each other but this is an impressive event
2599122 we like to play ball even me and im a wrestler i like to play ball and get out here and have some fun
2599123 but the main reason im here is for the barbecue
2599124 with new disclosures that the administration tried to cook the books at the cia by creating a phony forged link between al qaeda and saddam hussein we cannot step back and let this president escape accountability
2599125 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2599126 i just hope at the end of the season i feel like i made the right decision
2599127 i like to do things in formats that my players are familiar with
2599128 how do you tell brett favre to adapt to you
2599129 no one cares about us at all lets call it what it is its good all the attention has went the other way cause we really dont like it so you know brett favre going to the jets it can be pretty positive for us all you guys are going to pay attention to them now
2599130 he got a broadway sign and hes on the paper every day so now they have to deal with it i think he is going to realize the media is a little different than in green bay he cant control it
2599131 we have our quarterback eli manning here hes not planning on retiring or doing anything silly for the next couple of years so i think we are all right were worrying about the giants
2599132 hes almost the michael jordan of the nfl right now
2599133 he is leaving the one team that he has always known and now he is starting a new chapter in his life i am sure he is excited
2599134 really to be honest with you people dont care about you as a person they just want to know what have you done for me lately with brett favre he has done very well for the packers i just dont think that him leaving the packers was a great thing because you never know with them the jets
2599135 i just dont know if that was a smooth idea for brett favre he had a good thing with the packers but if they didnt want him back
2599136 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital

2599143 it the eu presidency demands an immediate ceasefire it welcomes the offer of the ceasefire from georgia and expects from russia that it will immediately accept such a ceasefire
2599144 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2599145 they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered
2599146 weve been in contact with leaders in both georgia and russia at all levels of government georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2599147 i wanted her not to tell the public what had happened
2599148 im saying you asked me about that photograph i dont know anything about that photograph i dont know who that baby is i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2599149 we would have had the biggest problem since the boston tea party
2599150 youtube is an amazing video sharing site its great to get everyone together
2599151 its all about the experience meeting together and really understanding the celebration of the virtual world
2599152 the whole interesting thing about the youtube community is its all about connecting to others
2599153 youtube has its own culture its own celebrities its own politics
2599154 the youtube stars are kind of like the new tv stars
2599155 there might be youtube celebrities here but its also the ones that arent that well known the ones that you make friends with online they are the ones who make me really happy to meet in person
2599156 construction of the sagrada familia began in 1882 and its current scheduled completion development is 2026
2599157 similarly theres never a scheduled completion date for how things look in video games as the tech is always constantly evolving
2599158 deferred lighting has had very limited use in the marketplace until now
2599159 with static lighting we have set light sources we may only have four light sources available to us and we usually cant set those sources in any way to take advantage of shadows or darkness
2599160 or we can create the look of light in an environment by baking it into the textures but a shadow thats baked into the environment wont move
2599161 were not limited to how many lights we can put in the world were only limited by rendering speed we can have point lights cone lights directional lights and the lighting and shadow situations that come with them but in order to have a game run smoothly at 30 or 60 frames per second we have to keep the resources of the gpu graphics processing unit tightly allocated very roughly each frame of an animated movie requires about six hours of rendering time by contrast the processing resources allocated for the lighting for a video game graphics running at 30 frames per second is typically 33 milliseconds
2599162 from a sense of the production pipeline we knew we couldnt use static lighting again static lighting requires all the models to be done before the lighting can be rigged if one new object is added everything has to be rigged all over again and its a very time consuming process in this model even if the level is very blocky we can still begin lighting it creating a video game is like setting sail on a ship while youre still building it and while you still may not be entirely sure where youre going in a situation like that yeah lets try to build tools that dont completely flail about if things arent done in a particular order by keeping as much as we could dynamic we were just able to crank every day on the lighting in tandem with the people building art and the people putting new items in the game

2599164 the nature of his injuries were such that in spite of their efforts his life could not be saved

2599178 hopefully well get something done i have talked to plax and showed him our schedule and he knows the time left to prepare ourselves he knows and agrees that we dont want to break camp without him having gotten anything done

2599193 school performance should not be seen simply as a proxy for intelligence
2599194 doing badly at school is not a cause of schizophrenia but it is a marker for something not being quite right several years prior to diagnosis
2599195 this isnt going to be a way of identifying people at school who are at risk of developing schizophrenia
2599196 but it could be useful when considering someone who is displaying other potential symptoms of impending psychosis
2599197 it is important to recognise that mental illnesses like schizophrenia are not linked to low intelligence the opposite is often true
2599198 there are lots of reasons why young people perform poorly in exams
2599199 problems with concentration and mental distress can interfere with studying and these can also be early signs of mental illness symptoms that commonly begin in late teens
2599200 the people in the study might have had normal intelligence but started having low level symptoms that disrupted their schooling
2599201 what do you think you think its fun watching that crap
2599202 hes smart enough and can retain enough that we can put some limited things in for him at receiver
2599203 he didnt look flustered he stood in there and made the good throws made a run or two and caught some balls
2599204 hes been very impressive we just need to get him to understand more about what hes doing but physically hes a force out there
2599205 if i wasnt sure i wouldnt have committed right now
2599206 its a great opportunity to play both sports at the highest level
2599207 coach brooks has a history of letting his players play two sports and he was real open to it when we talked that played a big part in my decision
2599208 if you go anywhere youre going to have to compete that doesnt really bother me ill be ready to compete wherever i go

2599210 negotiating any piece of legislation through the senate is always a challenge
2599211 i have had discussions with some of the cross bench senators theyll continue and we will continue to argue vigorously for fuelwatch
2599212 this is really giving motorists the chance to call for a tender for their petrol and really the conservatives in the senate should get out of the way and let motorists have that opportunity
2599213 the biggest motoring organisation in the country the nrma supports it and motoring organisations that have lived with fuelwatch in western australia for eight years which was sceptical when it first came in and is now one of its strongest supporters the racwa argues for fuelwatch
2599214 i dont know that id say generally the tides turning against labor
2599215 its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2599216 in the community so far as the federal government is concerned i continue to get good feedback from the public who indicate theyre pleased that weve been implementing our election promises and they believe that the government is doing a good job
2599217 i always have believed that the australian public make a very clear distinction between voting for a territory government or voting for a state government and voting for a federal government
2599218 they understand fully all the implications of our federal system so i dont draw too much into the northern territory result and i wont draw too much from the west australian result other than to say we know it will be a tough election
2599219 but the liberals have been very much in disarray here wa and wa premier alan carpenters done a good job in difficult circumstances so whilst we think it will be tough were confident that alan carpenter will do well
2599220 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up
2599221 i didnt detect many federal issues running through the northern territory campaign i think it is always very dangerous to try and extrapolate state results on to federal results or vice versa
2599222 australians are pretty clear at their levels of government and are pretty clear on what they are voting on
2599223 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2599224 im only one side of the test but im happy to participate in one

2599226 the money power preys upon the nation and conspires against it in times of adversity it is more despotic than monarchy more insolent than autocracy more selfish than bureaucracy i see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country corporations have been enthroned an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed
2599227 after that i got mad and played not very concentrated the rest of the round
2599228 i couldnt come back after that eight because i was mad
2599229 i was fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the round

2599231 i have them thanks to my children and now i can consider me a fan of the two platforms wii and ds who can resist always loved the design rather reminds apple but nintendo has managed to insert quite well on their consoles we wanted a charismatic character and futuristic where everyone is able to identify the first thing that came to my head was even the wii
2599232 i can tell from your chart that you tend to prefer a holistic bent to treatment
2599233 love it she didnt just prescribe and run my kinda girl
2599234 school classes medical appointments church services or other appointments in compliance with her probation
2599235 this was a negotiated plea we worked a long time with the defense attorney we thought it was fair everyone agreed to it and now probation isnt making sure the conditions are met in my opinion
2599236 i talked with the deputy director in columbia she knew what i was calling about and she said she was going to check into it and talk to them and get back with me and that was yesterday and i havent heard back from them yet
2599237 we have received the details concerning this case and we are currently in the process of looking into the allegations
2599238 were working to get to the bottom of why the probation agent made the decision and to see if the probation conditions in this case are being followed
2599239 its not to cause any problems with this individual shes doing what shes allowed to do but what i want her to understand and i want the community to understand that there are consequences to your actions and theres accountability
2599240 if the scene is not coming to you it doesnt need to be written
2599241 while the implication is impressive 10 times as many scientists question global warming what stossel didnt tell abc viewers were the significant qualitative differences between the two petitions the first petition was circulated by the well respected union of concerned scientists and signed by 110 nobel laureates the second petition was a response organized by industry affiliated groups that included dentists nutritionists and others with no expertise in climatology the only alleged requirement for signing on was a bachelors degree in science for a time the screening process was so lax that the list included a number of gag names like ginger spice and michael j fox added by environmentalists
2599242 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie
2599243 representing oneself in a court of law guarantees that there will be a less than gifted lawyer with a less than intelligent client
2599244 i was diagnosed when i was 13 with photosensitive epilepsy sensitivity to light after having three seizures
2599245 it is triggered by flickering lights tv screens computers etc
2599246 it is like i am having a bit like a day dream but you come back really quickly
2599247 when you come back it is like somebody has switched the light back on i can be talking to somebody and all of a sudden they can be saying something different and i havent got a clue what they have been saying i can be very confused
2599248 i have had near misses crossing roads and i burnt myself ironing at home once so i dont iron any more
2599249 when i was younger someone had to sit with me when i was in the bath now i am older i take a shower
2599250 i dont cook alone there needs to be someone there
2599251 the websites and leaflets i had growing up were very negative about it i found there are ways of doing things not everything was restricted
2599252 i was told i could never swim or travel alone i was told i could never do anything alone
2599253 i do not get a lot of time alone most of my time is spent with people but i have taken up surfing and can do this provided there are people around
2599254 of course there are things that you cant do but there are things you can
2599255 it gives voice to young people with epilepsy and presents their real experiences learning from others in a similar situation can bring so much hope and encouragement and above all young people with epilepsy can see that they are not alone
2599256 there is a lot of information out there but young people find it difficult to find the information about their particular type of epilepsy there is such a range they found it difficult to see what applied to them
2599257 there was also a lack of awareness in the ways it could affect their lives
2599258 epilepsy is a much misunderstood condition which is still often highly stigmatised a diagnosis can have a dramatic impact on every aspect of a persons life
2599259 this site allows young people who are sometimes quite isolated by the condition to gain an insight into how other young people with epilepsy are feeling and how they are dealing with situations in their lives
2599260 you watch a team play and say why were they 5 6
2599261 you go back and see they lost two in ot they had a key player get hurt always look for a team that lost games they could have won

2599272 he was covered with blood when they brought him in and they didnt get him any medical attention thats the main thrust of our suit
2599273 inmate dumping is an unconstitutional yet common practice of the miller county sheriffs department whereby arrestees or detainees in need of medical care are delivered to a hospital but in an attempt to avoid payment the miller county sheriffs department releases the individual from custody even though the need for medical care arose while the individual was in their custody

2599279 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2599280 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2599281 fremtidens ledere er personer som i deres samtid vover at p ber be sig deres irrelevans som et guddommeligt kald der tillader dem at solidarisere sig dybt med den lidelse der lurer bag al succes glimmer og at formidle jesu lys netop der
2599282 men hvis man er sikkert rodf stet i et n rt personligt forhold til livets kilde kan man v re fleksibel uden at v re relativistisk overbevist uden at v re skr sikker konfronterende uden at v re angribende mild og tilgivende uden at v re bl d og eftergivende og et sandt vidne uden at v re manipulerende
2599283 n r spiritualitet reduceres til tom snak om ndelighed bliver livet i legemet reduceret til k delighed
2599284 bekendelse og tilgivelse er netop de discipliner hvorved k delighed og tom ndelig snak kan undg s og inkarnationen i sandhed kan udleves gennem bekendelse bringes m rkets magter ud af deres k delige isolation og frem i lyset hvor de synligg res for f llesskabet gennem tilgivelse bliver de afv bnet og bortvist og det bliver muligt p ny at integrere krop og nd
2599285 noget af det mest ironiske ved kristendommens historie er at dens ledere igen og igen gav efter for fristelsen til magt politisk magt milit r magt konomisk magt eller moralsk og ndelig magt p trods af at de til stadighed mente at tale p vegne af den jesus som ikke insisterede p sin guddommelige magt man gav afkald p sin ret og blev som os

2599358 vi forkynder at i skal vende om fra disse tomme guder til den levende gud som har skabt himlen og jorden og havet med alt hvad de rummer
2599359 i tidligere tider har gud ladet alle hedninger g deres egne veje v17 og alligevel har han vidnet om sig selv gennem sine velgerninger ved at give jer regn fra himlen og frugtbare rstider ved at m tte jer og ved at fylde jeres hjerter med gl de
2599360 de styrkede disciplene og formanede dem til at blive i troen og sagde igennem mange tr ngsler skal vi g ind i guds rige

2599372 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2599373 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2599374 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2599375 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2599376 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve

2599381 no alcanza con la imaginaci n me parece que es necesario para poder escribir la experiencia vital de ah que se reduce mucho el n mero de escritores que puede dar cuenta de la cultura bonaerense
2599382 lo primero que empec a escribir en la adolescencia fueron canciones de rock para bandas del barrio viv el comienzo de viejas locas o r o verde el primer nombre de callejeros e infinidad de bandas del sudoeste y el oeste una zona muy prol fica en lo musical no hab a mucho para hacer en el barrio cuando ten a 18 o 20 a os la vida pasaba por jugar a la pelota o por la bandita que armabas con tus amigos en esos lugares las bandas son muy importantes lo mismo pasa con las instituciones la parroquia la sociedad de fomento la unidad b sica las escuelas que en la poca en que viv a en celina cumpl an una funci n social que vaciaba el contenido ideol gico que ten an esas instituciones la unidad b sica antes que pol tica cumpl a una funci n social la parroquia antes que religiosa tambi n era social y de ese modo armaban una red comunitaria que a m me peg muy fuerte y que trato de plasmar en la mayor a de los relatos de villa celina que suceden en las calles
2599383 ah yo sab a que chorza iba a terminar en algo raro
2599384 me gusta cuando algo de lo que escribo se abre paso entre gente com n y no tanto del palo de la literatura de capital que lo pueda leer gente de celina o un pibe del barrio en los ltimos d as recib varios mails de gente de celina y chicos de burzaco y marcos paz se ve que el conurbano comparte una cultura y un imaginario similar a los de de villa celina que hace que mucha gente que lee el libro lo sienta como propio

2599393 i basically landed with my arm stretched across my body
2599394 i was able to get some relief in the locker room after being held down by two people while a doctor pulled twisted and popped it back into place the pain immediately went from a 10 to 1 and i was so relieved that i actually started laughing
2599395 heres the deal i have a torn labrum which basically is a muscle in the shoulder joint that holds everything in place
2599396 i will also be working out the other parts of my body that arent hurt by swimming sprinting cycling leg training and eating 6 nutritious high protein meals a day after two weeks doc andrews will assess my progress and determine if i have to have surgery or not

2599398 friday might not have been the best day for some wrestlers to answer their cell phones or home phones or blackberrys or emails or even answer their front doors
2599399 these are tough pieces of news to deliver i know of what i speak but the individuals who are released and their families are the ones that are obviously the hardest hit
2599400 the 12 000 plus that are slated to attend the fight in lesnars present hometown will definitely be pro brock which cant hurt a thing as it relates to lesnars chances of not going 0 2 in the ufc
2599401 being a lesnar fan i have plenty of concerns regarding this fight but i do think he will win and demonstrate how much his technique has improved since his debut its really hard to see this fight going to the judges

2599410 the family is at the base other groups and associations are in the middle and the state is at the top to coordinate and protect
2599411 if a stranger committed a crime on someone elses land it would be necessary to find out to whom he or she owed loyalty in order to know what law applied
2599412 the fusion of the idea of the nation a unitary system of shared cultural attributes with the political apparatus of the state
2599413 a shift from complex space varied communal contexts with overlapping jurisdictions and levels of authority to a simple space characterized by a duality of individual and state
2599414 the state creates society by replacing the complex overlapping loyalties of medieval societates with one society bounded by borders and ruled by one sovereign to whom allegiance is owed in a way that trumps all other allegiances
2599415 peace would never be attained if essentially undecidable matters such as the end of human life were left open to public debate
2599416 a society of men constituted only for the procuring preserving and advancing their own civil interests
2599417 life liberty health and indolency of body and the possession of outward things such as money lands houses furniture and the like
2599418 the body politic does not pursue a common good but seeks to liberate the individual to pursue his or her own ends contrary to christian anthropology the sovereign individual is presented here as the natural not merely postlapsarian condition of humankind
2599419 the state is not just a part of society but has in our day become synonymous with society
2599420 the rise and aggrandizement of political states took place in circumstances of powerful opposition to kinship and other traditional authorities
2599421 prior to the rise of the state central authority was weak and associations strong
2599422 came to be seen as the sole source of law and as the guarantor of property and inheritance rights
2599423 took over many of the civil functions formerly belonging to the church such as the system of ecclesiastical courts the state claimed a monopoly on the means of coercion and facilitated the enclosure of common lands in all places war was the principal means by which the growth of the state advanced
2599424 war requires a direct disciplinary relationship between the individual and the state and so has served as a powerful solvent of the loyalties of individuals to social groups other than the state pg
2599425 corporate leaders not only buy influence over politicians regulators and public opinion but the business executive him or herself becomes a type of public official
2599426 it is not simply that government has gotten big and economic and social transactions of every kind must pass through the organs of the state it is also that the state itself as well as churches schools unions and other associations has been colonized by the logic of the market
2599427 why were common people willing to sacrifice their lives for nations their grandparents had never heard of
2599428 the loosing of individuals from traditional forms of community created the possibility and need of a larger mass substitute for community loyalties are gradually transferred from more local types of community to the nation
2599429 political and civil rights name both the freeing of the individual from traditional types of community and the establishment of regular relations of power between the individual and the state
2599430 integral to the political common good is a distribution of goods that reflect a common mind arrived at by rational deliberation rationality in turn depends upon recognition of our fundamental dependence on one another
2599431 the nation state is an arena of bargaining amongst different group interests
2599432 decisions on the distribution of goods are made on the basis of power which is most often directly related to access to capital
2599433 t sheer size of the nation state precludes genuine rational deliberation deliberation is carried on by a political elite of lawyers lobbyists and other professionals
2599434 at its most benign the nation state is most realistically likened as in macintyres apt metaphor to the telephone company a large bureaucratic provider of goods and services that never quite provides value for money
2599435 the nation state is a simulacrum of common life where false order is parasitical on true order in a bureaucratic order whose main function is to adjudicate struggles for power between various factions a sense of unity is produced by the only means possible sacrifice to false gods in war the nation state may be understood theologically as a kind of parody of the church meant to save us from division
2599436 the church must constitute itself as an alternative social space and not simply rely on the nation state to be its social presence the church needs at every opportunity to complexify space that is to promote the creation of spaces in which alternative economies and authorities flourish

2599440 the hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist
2599441 mcdonalds cannot flourish without mcdonnell douglas the designer of the u s air force f 15 and the hidden fist that keeps the world safe for silicon valleys technologies to flourish is called the u s army air force navy and marine corps
2599442 for globalism to work america cant be afraid to act like the almighty superpower that it is
2599443 the hidden hand of the market will never work without
2599444 while there are many obvious downsides to war from 15 000 feet
2599445 it does have one great strength its sustainability nato can carry on this sort of air war for a long long time the serbs need to remember that
2599446 if natos only strength is that it can bomb forever then it has to get every ounce out of that lets at least have a real air war the idea that people are still holding rock concerts in belgrade or going out for sunday merry go round rides while their fellow serbs are cleansing kosovo is outrageous it should be lights out in belgrade every power grid water pipe bridge road and war related factory has to be targeted
2599447 like it or not we are at war with the serbian nation the serbs certainly think so and the stakes have to be very clear every week you ravage kosovo is another decade we will set your country back by pulverizing you you want 1950 we can do 1950 you want 1389 we can do 1389 too
2599448 i have tried to prove that their arrival was not haphazard but part of a concept aimed at changing this society and the relations among the ethnic groups
2599449 we could not understand where bosnia was was it in america or in the southern hemisphere or in asia we did not have a clue where it was when we learned that it was part of yugoslavia in eastern europe we still did not have any idea how many muslims lived there or how and when islam had arrived there
2599450 what happened in b h was not only a war between muslims and serbs but a war between islam and christianity
2599451 the americans and the europeans often ask how managed so successfully to penetrate europe and the west by creating terrorist cells throughout italy france denmark austria germany sweden spain great britain canada and even the united states
2599452 dayton 2 for them so as to abolish the serb republic and its institutions
2599453 ich war entsetzt und sch mte mich zugleich f r das was ich gerade gesagt hatte
2599454 sieht ganz so aus als habe es die new republic mit einem neuen stephen glass zu tun
2599455 ich bin der gefreite scott thomas beauchamp ein mitglied der alpha company 1 18 infantry second brigade combat team first infantry division
2599456 ich bin bereit mit meinem wahren namen zur gesamtheit meiner artikel f r die new republic zu stehen
2599457 sie waren nie als darstellung des gesamten us milit rs gedacht
2599458 es macht mich gelinde gesagt verr ckt zu sehen dass die plausibilit t von ereignissen die ich bezeugt habe von leuten bezweifelt wird die nie im irak gedient haben
2599459 die behauptungen des gefreiten beauchamp haben sich als falsch herausgestellt sein zug und seine einheit wurden vernommen und keiner konnte die vorw rfe erh rten
2599460 alle soldaten seiner einheit haben alle vorw rfe bestritten die der gefreite beauchamp in seinem blog gemacht hat
2599461 wir haben mit milit rpersonal gesprochen das direkt an den ereignissen beteiligt war die scott thomas beauchamp beschrieben hat sie haben seine darstellung bekr ftigt
2599462 perfekt in den virulentesten erz hlstil der anti kriegs linken
2599463 im prinzip haben sie wieder mal die selben fehler gemacht
2599464 sie fielen auf oberfl chliche filmreife lebendigkeit herein auf pseudo romanhaften dialog alles mit dem ziel vorurteile zu verst rken die so tief sa en dass die redakteure nicht mal merkten dass ihnen honig ums maul geschmiert wurde
2599465 offenkundig ist der nahe osten insgesamt nicht nur der irak sondern die gesamte region eine wichtige energiequelle insbesondere f r erd l f r die gesamte welt
2599466 als howard 2003 befragt wurde ob der krieg etwas mit erd l zu tun habe sagte er dass dies nicht der fall sei
2599467 first century church leaders didnt innovate to be trendy rather they were driven by the mission jesus had given them today we have the same mission
2599468 sie haben sich nicht vorgestellt und mich nicht gegr t
2599469 es sind ganz offenkundig dinge passiert die sich mit einer glaubw rdigen menschenrechtspolitik nicht vereinbaren lassen
2599470 wie konnte das geschehen und haben wir damals wirklich alles gemacht
2599471 wenn feststeht wer damals die verantwortung trug dann kann derjenige nicht im amt bleiben
2599472 ich fordere bundesinnenminister sch uble und bundesau enminister steinmeier zu einer sofortigen klarstellung auf warum die damalige f hrung des bundesinnenministeriums und frank walter steinmeier selbst als damaliger kanzleramtsminister trotz der erkenntnisse der geheimdienste ber murat kurnaz unschuld dessen wiedereinreise nach deutschland und damit auch die haftentlassung aus guantanamo verhindert haben
2599473 der islam war f r mich ein schritt nach vorn
2599474 dein talent ist dir von allah gegeben worden und es ist deine aufgabe mit dem schatz den allah dir geschenkt hat dem verm gen das allah in deine h nde gelegt hat n mlich musiker zu sein im leben gut umzugehen und es nicht zu zerst ren oder zu verhindern
2599475 ich bin jetzt muslim geworden alles ist jetzt anderes ihr m sst jetzt auf mich reagieren
2599476 we will mobilise the machinery from all wings to ensure that we face the by election fully prepared
2599477 we did not talk about the matter it is the decision of the president on who will be the candidate
2599478 this is still in the pilot phase what we do now is we install computers in the rukun tetangga centres and teach the officers how to report to us through the system
2599479 by the end of the ninth malaysia plan we hope we can have a fully running system where all our rt centres can report directly to us
2599480 what we are concerned now is how we can reduce the hotspots for community conflicts in our list
2599481 and every two weeks we sit down and analyse the data we get and advise them on what to do or not to do
2599482 if this programme online is put in place we will get immediate feedback on whats going on in every rt community
2599483 our officers and rt are being trained on how to do their reporting online hopefully by next year well cover more areas especially in the four states where the hotspots are concentrated
2599484 i dont have the exact cost of the project but we have some funds allocated for this under our ict development plan
2599485 some of my officers and rt heads have gone for the first course hopefully theyll complete the second round by the end of this year
2599486 if there is any fighting or misunderstanding the police can call us and we can go and mediate
2599487 this will help resolve issues and defuse tension on the ground
2599488 they feel it will be good if we can help out in small conflicts as they have many other things to look into
2599489 because many of them also dont know what mediation is all about
2599490 they will act like intelligence agents for the police to help gather information on criminal activities
2599491 we started this seminar keselamatan kejiranan neighbourhood safety seminar last year to brief my people about crime safety and the neighbourhood and how rt can play its role
2599492 it was also a platform to meet and get to know each other
2599493 healthy people are the greatest asset of any nation and molecular screening promises better management of health risk
2599494 this will lead to specific interventions aimed at reducing risks including adjustments for nutrition lifestyle and environment
2599495 it is obvious that pkr is out to convince people that the by election result would be a barometer to show who is wrong and who is right
2599496 we didnt want the anger to lead to any untoward incident
2599497 there are certain things that are out of bounds for public discussion even if held in a private place
2599498 there are many ancillary issues arising out of the provisions of article 121 1a and these must be resolved fast i believe the forum if it was allowed to go to its full length could have found solutions to some of the issues
2599499 it gives you much more to work with if youre filming in that world instead of a green screen you have to bring a story to life in a movie in a way you dont have to in a book even a book as powerful as that
2599500 we wanted actual locations instead of something cgi to give it a heightened sense of reality
2599501 we still dont know what exactly caused the blackout and sesco is still trying very hard to restore the supply as soon as possible
2599502 we have the authority to tell them that at any event if there is a threat towards the public
2599503 at the moment i do not see anyone who can give anwar a run for his money
2599504 we explored options on checks for two b737 400 aircraft once space became available at our tullamarine facility a decision was taken to have the work done there
2599505 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2599506 and to move off the path of cost cutting and any further possibilities of further job reductions in their maintenance and engineering area
2599507 all the highlights were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before aircraft delivery to australia
2599508 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini and shamala revisited
2599509 due to security concerns we have been advised by the police to wrap it up by 10am
2599510 we have no issue or quarrel with anyone who has a different point of view
2599511 we respect everybodys views in this building and that is what the bar council is about
2599512 even if we do have one we would prefer to hold it behind closed doors
2599513 only if and until umno goes multiracial can the non malay parties follow suit otherwise it will force mca to remain where it is
2599514 the non malay parties are pushing for a multiracial outlook but not umno and pas they are not articulating how they are going to help the other races so who is going to tackle chinese and indian issues
2599515 the question that should be asked therefore is not whether the mca or mic should adopt a multiracial outlook but to turn it around and ask the malay parties whether they are willing to do so
2599516 if umno and pas remain mono ethnic it will force mca and mic to continue in their present format by 2020 bumiputeras will make up 60 per cent of the countrys population
2599517 if umno does not take the lead and go multiracial it is crucial for the minority groupings to remain as they are
2599518 although the rule of law is an initiation of political leaders like me it is also a vital component for political success as it ensures an orderly society
2599519 for as in absolute governments the king is law so in free countries the law ought to be king and there ought to be no other
2599520 all necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660 and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area
2599521 i have indicated it is not in conformity with the un charter from our point of view and from the charter point of view it was illegal
2599522 to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind
2599523 the whole history of the world is summed up in the fact that when nations are strong they are not always just and when they wish to be just they are no longer strong
2599524 no today you will not make me not make me think dirty thoughts about anything i see or hear or do that could possibly make me think a dirty thought
2599525 charlotte thats very imaginative i dont know what it is but its very imaginative
2599526 he never left behind the ones he made in high school
2599527 if you were in a bad mood he would make you in a great mood
2599528 could never stand still there was a whole world to see and everywhere he went he brought light and joy
2599529 our schools should be free from any negative elements schools should be breeding grounds for a good all round education
2599530 if a school is rich in tradition and gives its students a good education then that school will stand out
2599531 in fact places in a school like eton are much sought after not only by the people there but also by parents from around the world
2599532 and the schools excellent academic and co curricular performance is the reason eton is special
2599533 schools like these have a tradition they build on this tradition and this is what we want
2599534 there is no point in giving good education if the students turn out to be robbers and thieves
2599535 it is an honour for me and i believe they have confidence in malaysia
2599536 i will fulfil my election pledges based on my belief and commitment to the democratic process such as in capacity building for the alleviation of poverty economic empowerment of the poor exploiting the traditional commonwealth ties through cultural exchanges and youth work and supporting each other in the process of finding innovative solutions to the current food energy and climate issues
2599537 what is more important now is to unite all the countries in the commonwealth family and i hope to get the support of all the regions
2599538 as the returning officer i did not receive any report of irregularities in fact this was the best election ever
2599539 expanding the role of parliamentarians in a global society environment development and security
2599540 the party needs to change or else it will perish
2599541 failed not in the sense that what now exists is nothing but that it is so much less than what might or could have been mca is capable of and deserves so much better what choices are there with this downturn in mcas political fortune
2599542 we must not continue to look at everything from the chinese viewpoint but from a malaysian perspective after 51 years of independence we need to look at issues as malaysians and not be pigeonholed
2599543 in this regard adopting a multiracial approach is an excellent proposition i grew up in a kampung in teluk kemang near port dickson where people of all races had no problems interacting with each other
2599544 we could call each other abang or even taikor whenever we met at the kopitiam and could sit down together for a drink if this attitude can be transposed to politics all will be well
2599545 while it cannot be said that the group against change is more influential or vociferous than the other or even if there are in fact two distinct groups it remains that the core grassroots continue to perceive the chinese as being marginalised and as such in need of protection
2599546 while party leaders understand the need to focus on multiracialism they still need to take into account the wants and needs of the grassroots most of whom are from the older generation those between their mid 40s to 60s
2599547 many of the grassroots are not internet savvy they comprise the older generation are chinese educated and many reside in new villages
2599548 it was quite difficult psychologically making that transition from going to the office every day to staying at home and working
2599549 i didnt have to get dressed i could just sit around all day in my pyjamas and write nobody would know or care
2599550 i looked out the door and saw sparks flying and i could hear crashing but i couldnt see anything
2599551 luckily it knocked him off the motorcycle and we was able to get to him so we didnt have to do anything with the tree
2599552 it ripped the power box right off of my house with the telephone pole
2599553 last year fujitsu made umpc history with its landmark feature rich lifebook u1010 continuing in its unique 3 in 1 tablet notebook handheld pc tradition the amazing lifebook u2010 cements our triumph in this field as it replicates the ingenuity of the u1010 as well as accentuating its lifestyle features with an array of distinctive colours and wireless music on demand all while remaining fashionably small and powerfully compact
2599554 she was sort of disturbing other spectators around her which is against the house rules
2599555 me pas algo muy loco que tiene que ver con este mismo lugar con eterna cadencia pablo braun uno de los due os de la librer a a quien yo no conoc a un d a me mand un mail para contarme que hab a le do objetos maravillosos en el que aparece hilda la se ora que cuida los coches sobre la calle honduras pablo sali a la calle con un ejemplar del libro y se lo regal hilda no sab a nada y dicen que se puso a llorar
2599556 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2599557 in 2006 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time
2599558 all of my family knows about this and just to be absolutely clear none of them are responsible for it i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2599559 just imagine what would have happened if the snakes had managed to slither away
2599560 podem ainda n o estar a ver as coisas superficie mas por baixo j est tudo a arder
2599561 while the implication is impressive 10 times as many scientists question global warming what stossel didnt tell abc viewers were the significant qualitative differences between the two petitions the first petition was circulated by the well respected union of concerned scientists and signed by 110 nobel laureates the second petition was a response organized by industry affiliated groups that included dentists nutritionists and others with no expertise in climatology the only alleged requirement for signing on was a bachelors degree in science for a time the screening process was so lax that the list included a number of gag names like ginger spice and michael j fox added by environmentalists
2599562 had he been the father of the child they certainly would have known
2599563 i found out my granddaughter has been taken she has been missing for a month were talking about a 3 year old little girl i need to find her

2599590 the people will get back what is rightly theirs with the oil royalty back in the states coffers we can plan and carry out projects that are people centric
2599591 it is now economically feasible to activate the old oil wells the reserves in such fields may be more than adequate to cover the production costs
2599592 we will give them five to 15 seedlings to be planted around their houses in three years the owners can start harvesting the fruits
2599593 if you have 10 trees for example you can get an average income of rm300 a month this has been implemented in several states and it has been successful
2599594 it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the beijing olympics
2599595 when i would bring it up he would laugh it off and blow me off
2599596 all the way through the deal and through the press conference i wasnt certain it was going to happen
2599597 when peter said he wanted to talk to wayne privately i was sure they were going to pull the plug on it
2599598 it was the day that the hockey world stood still and then it has a seismic impact on hockey in the u s
2599599 you see california kids all of the time on junior rosters and there are many california kids and 95 of them are there because of gretzkys presence in california
2599600 gretzky captured the imagination of a lot of young people who wanted to be him
2599601 as a singular event you can argue that wayne going to los angeles was as much a catalyst for participation growth in this country as anything in the last 30 years except the miracle on ice in 1980
2599602 it is difficult to overstate the significance and positive impact the trade had on the league and particularly in u s markets which were non traditional hockey markets
2599603 i wasnt just the fact that wayne was the most dominant of all athletes in their respective sports it was his personality and demeanor and the way he championed hockey and the nhl
2599604 he is without a doubt in my mind the greatest ambassador of hockey that the sport has ever known
2599605 i stopped the car and said to a friend you know if we were in canada kids would be playing ball hockey or inline hockey here and it would be amazing
2599606 a year later there was a sign on the fence that said no inline hockey allowed and i was like weve come a long way
2599607 frankly when we first heard that it was potentially in the works i thought it was a joke the thought that he could be traded in the prime of his career didnt seem reasonable
2599608 one symbol of the magnitude of the deal was that espn carried the news conference live from edmonton and this was at a time when espn didnt do a whole lot of that
2599609 there was a mob scene at the press conference and they were breaking into television shows to report the trade
2599610 but everybody knows those trades are coming this gretzky deal shocked people i certainly remember the outcry from edmonton fans after it happened
2599611 in todays world i dont know if that would be allowed
2599612 walking in glen sather pulled me aside sat with me for a good hour trying to convince me that if we wanted to block the deal he could
2599613 he wouldnt speak to me or peter when this was going down
2599614 peter called and i thought we were going to talk about players again and i put him on the speaker because i wanted wayne to help me talk about players
2599615 i wanted him to nod to me if he wanted this player or that player and in the middle of the conversation peter made some nasty statement about gretzky
2599616 right away we became a contender that was the talk
2599617 when you came into our locker room it was like being at the oscars
2599618 one time after a game im getting undressed i look up and theres goldie hawn standing there and i have nothing on
2599619 when we went in there with our purple and gold uniforms we felt like we didnt even belong there
2599620 but when we had gretzky and we were dressed in silver and black it was different
2599621 bernie was one of those guys who brought joy into your house
2599622 whenever id be looking for a laugh i look for bernie on tv
2599623 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2599624 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2599625 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2599626 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2599627 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2599628 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
2599629 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2599630 we had a theory that started out really beautiful and elegant
2599631 and then someone beat on it and made it really ugly
2599632 the brain drain that used to go from europe to the states definitely has reversed
2599633 humankind differs from a collection of ants we have intellectual curiosity we need to understand the mechanisms of life and the universe
2599634 when they cut the cables i thought blood would flow out
2599635 many of us theorists would find that failure much more interesting than if we just find another boring old particle that some theorists predicted 45 years ago
2599636 there is no evidence to suggest that the type of music you listen to will cause you to commit suicide but those who are vulnerable and at risk of committing suicide may be listening to certain types of music
2599637 the key to understanding any teenager is to treat them with respect by listening to what they have to say rather than typecasting them according to the type of music they listen to
2599638 cest pas france dimanche qui fixera la date de mon mariage
2599639 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2599640 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a cease fire
2599641 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on non use of force with south ossetians
2599642 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2599643 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia
2599644 regrettably i have come to the conclusion it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground in the council on a draft statement to the press
2599645 this was our way of challenging young and vibrant minds in the english language while bringing together students from all ethnic and religious groups
2599646 it is common to hear that employers find it difficult to find recruits who are proficient in english the heavy use of sms language and reliance on the computer spell checker have contributed to this problem
2599647 the 28 students here representing their states deserve the highest praise and should be celebrated for their right to be here
2599648 as much as this is a competition about words this challenge is also a platform to recognise the qualities of confidence courage assurance and poise

2599654 grad school is a bad way to deal with uncertainty about your career goals
2599655 if you want to be a ceo you should be an investment banking analyst first thats because being a ceo is really about making decisions with limited information and thats what analysts do best
2599656 i have met more employee parents in india than in all other countries combined
2599657 im really disappointed because you can achieve such great things and i expect much more from you than this
2599658 nothing was actually decided but many points were raised that we were able to explain and clarify to each other and that was very good
2599659 i think muslims were able to understand that a man who converts to islam should still be responsible to look after the wife and children he had before converting
2599660 they feel that once you go into islam you cannot come out we were firm that this should not be the case so there is no agreement on this we felt it should be further discussed
2599661 so this dialogue is a very positive step and something that must continue so that we can all sit down and talk with one another to find amicable solutions to our problems
2599662 there was a lot of misunderstanding and disagreement from the muslim group then but what is happening now is similar to what we had proposed
2599663 i dont think we can rush solutions more dialogues need to follow we should also expand the muslim representation to include progressive groups
2599664 rather than a common grappling of issues related to the legitimate rights of citizens
2599665 they made us a bit uncomfortable as they kept stressing that islam was the religion of the land and that the sultanate and the malays were here long before the chinese and the indians
2599666 we never disputed that we only want our rights to profess other religions to be respected
2599667 was a good start to express feelings anxieties and dissatisfactions from both sides
2599668 although we cant find all the solutions to the problems it was a fruitful event
2599669 everyone engaged in inter religious dialogues must keep an open mind listen to what is said not who says it
2599670 we must respect others and at the end of the day celebrate the agreements and respect the idea of agreeing to disagree we can be different and yet live in harmony laws of the country must be respected
2599671 the delegates were able to be honest with each other
2599672 both parties felt that they were so burdened with stereotypical images of each other
2599673 they proved themselves wrong and they showed that they were mature enough and strong enough to listen
2599674 what do i want to do when i grow up

2599676 sir ian blair the metropolitan police commissioner is facing an inquiry over his friendship with a businessman who has been awarded stg3 million rm21 6 million of scotland yards contracts
2599677 he will be questioned about his links with andy miller whom he has known for 30 years and has accompanied on skiing holidays
2599678 when constabulary dutys done a policemans lot is not a happy one happy one
2599679 should the size of my 8 megabyte buffer be 8 000 000 bytes or 8 388 608 bytes 8 times 1024 times 1024
2599680 i think you should use a buffer size of 1025 instead of 1024 so theres room for a c string with 1024 bytes and the terminating character
2599681 the program will be more efficient if you use a size of 1024 instead of 1025 because its a power of 2
2599682 three thousand bytes i dont know how your momma taught you back in hicksville but in the army we dont just pull numbers like that out of our heineys we use powers of ten or macros already defined in the system header files fix the code private
2599683 we were not worried when he got a word wrong after that it was smooth sailing for him
2599684 even with mounting pressure from the other contestants i strongly believed that she could be the best national speller
2599685 reading is the most conventional and effective way of improving your vocabulary
2599686 perhaps next year through a ministry allocation the winning schools can upgrade their premises this should ensure greater involvement from third parties namely the parent teacher association alumni as well as the school itself
2599687 the challenge is an approach towards making language learning fun and it involves parents and teachers
2599688 look at the number of schools including those from rural areas that participated it is good for our education system
2599689 this is what holistic education is about we want students who are not just academically excellent but who also carry themselves well and who are of good character
2599690 it is not just the responsibility of my ministry through such joint efforts you can see the confidence of students grow and they will become people who can compete at the international level
2599691 we are looking to raise a generation of confident competitive and communicative people who are able to be on par with the rest of the world
2599692 this is a beneficial and worthwhile effort by the two companies and i hope that it goes further and bigger in years to come
2599693 it is highly encouraging to see the enthusiasm of not only the participants but also the parents and teachers involved in this competition
2599694 neroli is a medicine that the soul craves when besieged by stress anxiety worry and depression like scented liquid sunlight the yellow drops of citrus joy uplift the mind from gloomy moods rescue the heart from realms of sadness and grief and strengthen the spirit of those enduring unending hardships inhaling a few drops of neroli from the palms has a fortifying effect on the brain and nervous system while simultaneously pacifying the irritation of sensory over stimulation the effects of neroli on emotional well being can be compared to the nourishing soothing and revitalizing effects of mediterranean sunshine for those who cannot escape their troubles and flee to a greek isle or an italian villa enveloping oneself in nerolis blessed aura is the next best thing widespread use of neroli could end the daily aggravations caused by the rat race of modern society especially if used for aromatherapy in cars scientific research has confirmed that inhaling the oil has an immediate sedative effect on over caffeinated hyperactive mice
2599695 aroma inhalation could be a very effective stress management method
2599696 nursing educators should play an important role in contributing to college students physical and psychological health by helping enhance their recognition of stress management and effectively relieving their stress using essential oils

2599719 several off the record interviews with officials formerly associated with mount weather
2599720 i am not at liberty to describe precisely what is the role and the mission and the capability that we have at mount weather or at any other precise location
2599721 the russians attempted to buy real estate right next door as a
2599722 high level governmental sources speaking in the promise of strictest anonymity told me pollock that each of the federal departments represented at mount weather is headed by a single person on whom is conferred the rank of a cabinet level official
2599723 as might be expected there is also an office of the presidency at mount weather
2599724 operate with few if any safeguards or guidelines 2 store necessary information
2599725 general bray gave tunneys subcommittee a list of the categories of files maintained at mount weather military installations government facilities communications transportation energy and power agriculture manufacturing wholesale and retail services manpower financial medical and educational institutions sanitary facilities population housing shelter and stockpiles
2599726 batteries of communications equipment connecting mount weather with the white house and raven rock the underground pentagon sixty miles north of washington as well as with almost every us military unit stationed around the globe
2599727 all internal communications are conducted by closed circuit color television
2599728 officials who were at mount weather during the 1960s say the complex was actually prepared to assume certain governmental powers at the time of the 1961 cuban missile crisis and the assassination of president kennedy in 1963
2599729 studies conducted at mount weather involve the control and management of domestic political unrest where there are material shortages such as food riots or in strike situations where the fpa determines that there are industrial disruptions and other domestic resource crises
2599730 we try to monitor situations and get to them before they become emergencies
2599731 ill be glad to tell you all about it but id have to kill you afterward
2599732 study reveals us has spent 4 trillion on nukes since 45
2599733 the government devoted at least 12 billion to civil defense projects to protect the population from nuclear attack but billions of dollars more were secretly spent on vast underground complexes from which civilian and military officials would run the government during a nuclear war
2599734 whereas our national security is dependent upon our ability to assure continuity of government at every level in any national emergency type situation that might conceivably confront the nation
2599735 no absolutely not i cant believe that asshole even said that
2599736 and i ask him if his life is ever lonely or if he ever feels dispare and he says hes learned to love it because thats really all part of it and it helps him feel the good times when theyre there

2599776 segregation in america whether de facto has always been about resources just as much as about race the idea behind segregation initially was not simply to punish blacks but to create an underclass that was limited in terms of what it could accomplish and thereby better suited for the menial tasks assigned to it there was a reason in other words that mr tabb would have beaten his slaves iftheyhad learned to read they would have been less suited to being slaves 2
2599777 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
2599778 what we had hoped for was more awareness some recognition that their position needed explaining and even justification
2599779 less intellectually inquisitive less knowledgeable and despite their good schools less broadly educated than high flyers in other professions
2599780 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
2599781 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
2599782 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
2599783 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
2599784 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
2599785 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
2599786 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
2599787 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
2599788 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
2599789 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
2599790 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
2599791 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
2599792 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
2599793 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
2599794 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
2599795 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
2599796 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
2599797 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
2599798 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
2599799 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
2599800 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
2599801 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
2599802 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
2599803 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
2599804 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
2599805 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
2599806 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
2599807 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
2599808 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
2599809 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
2599810 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
2599811 with the economic times being what they are a lot of families are challenged to buy basic necessities
2599812 we want these children to start school prepared feeling confident and you always feel good when you start school with new shoes
2599813 klingola klingons wanna see what too much time looks like
2599814 here lived a great streetsweeper who did his job well
2599815 est o acontecendo problemas por conta de resultados n o satisfat rios os t cnicos constataram um grande n mero de testes com problemas
2599816 eles operadoras tem uma obriga o que tem que cumprir como quando voc compra um apartamento voc tem que pagar as parcelas

2599818 you should do at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity above usual activity at work or home on at least five days of the week if you are already overweight or obese then you should aim to do between 60 and 90 minutes on five days of the week
2599819 nhs primary care staff felt there was a need for a guide that had appropriate advice for patients
2599820 its up to the discretion of the gp or nurse how they use this information its not about going to the gym but doing things like gardening to benefit health
2599821 this has to operate in tandem with advice support and education on healthy eating and making sensible lifestyle choices in order to make a significant impact on the weight of individuals there has to be a commitment to do as much exercise as possible
2599822 if somebody is suffering from the medical consequences of being obese or overweight they may be at risk of chronic heart disease stroke or have high blood pressure but if they lose weight they are more likely to reduce their health risks so it may be appropriate to raise the potential for exercise with the patient thats a discussion that has to take place between the gp and the patient
2599823 its a personal responsibility and people will not be helped unless they want to help themselves
2599824 most people who have not exercised before would struggle even to walk for 90 minutes a day let alone do weight training
2599825 what i generally recommend to my clients is 30minutes three times a week thats based on whats practical for them a lot of people work from 8am to 6pm to tell them that they need to do an extra hour and a half of exercising will put people off i think if i was an obese person i would be quite disheartened
2599826 it is somewhat dictatorial and inappropriate for many people it would be far better to make small changes to your lifestyle
2599827 the general awareness and demand for lpg is up and its been getting progressively more popular for the last six months we are inundated with inquiries about getting conversions done
2599828 the majority of cars we get are large six or eight cylinder engines although there are a number of smaller engines like mondeos and hondas coming through as well
2599829 i am tired of hiding tired of misspent and knotted energies tired of the hypocrisy and tired of acting as though i have something to hide
2599830 when she got the call that a liver had been found gillian was shocked frightened and happy all at the same time
2599831 we are absolutely ecstatic that this has happened but we are thinking about the donors family as well who are not celebrating at this time however this was their wish and the fact that they have saved my sisters life means that the donors death was not in vain
2599832 she knew that she had to get this operation or she would not be here is a few years it is going to be a long road to recovery for our gillian but she will get there
2599833 gillian has backed scotland on sundays campaign for presumed consent for organ donation and she will continue to do so because she feels so strongly about it
2599834 this operation shows there is hope for others on the waiting list she had waited a long time
2599835 it would be easy to curl up in a ball and give up
2599836 in the light of what is happening in zimbabwe it is extremely regrettable that the scottish parliament has to be involved in investing in zimbabwe i would be hopeful that as a corporate body we would be able to influence this decision
2599837 if we cant influence it then that is regrettable as a member of the corporate body i will be suggesting that they discuss this with baillie gifford their investment managers to find out whether there is any flexibility in the way it is managed
2599838 i have no idea how its funded or invested in that sense but like most msps i would be pretty concerned i should imagine that msps would be unhappy with it and people will start asking questions
2599839 by investing in a company the scottish parliament is giving both financial and moral support to what the company is doing you cant condemn something with one hand if you are paying for it with the other
2599840 the members pension scheme is part of a pooled fund which operates in accordance with the united nations principles for responsible investment
2599841 the parliament is only one of a large number of investors in the fund and cannot therefore direct where investments are made our total investment in this fund would have to be worth more than 50m in order for msps to be able to direct the investments
2599842 anglo american is deeply concerned about the current political situation in zimbabwe and condemns the violence and human rights abuses that are taking place
2599843 the responsible development of the unki mine will create a long term viable business which will be important to the economic future of zimbabwe for years to come
2599844 such investments might be serving to perpetuate robert mugabes despotic regime
2599845 this shows that there needs to be far more robust checks in place within local government over expenses they now exist in the scottish parliament but there is no real scrutiny being placed on councils this needs to be looked at and examined properly
2599846 its fair to say when we saw charlies claims there were a few eyebrows raised to put it mildly
2599847 spoken to councillor cefferty about his abnormally high mileage says he has a large area to cover and is working 13 hours a day
2599848 i have nothing to hide i have a lot of miles because i do lots of house visits thats a brand new car and its done 7 000 miles in three months i am renowned for the amount of work i do
2599849 my ward was enlarged to three times the size in may last year and since then everybody wants to speak to you they phone up all the councillors and play them one against each other and i want to be there first
2599850 i only do the work that i do and i dont claim for anything outwith the work i do in the past i have claimed probably 40 less than the miles i do
2599851 in the daytime at weekends and even in the early hours of the morning
2599852 when i do my house visits its not a milk round you cant see people in one particular area all together im a reactive councillor so i go where im needed
2599853 im in the civic centre most evenings because i have got peace and quiet there but i dont go to all the meetings because sometimes you are more productive by doing constituency work im a constituency councillor
2599854 my wife runs the pub and i am a partner in that pub i have to have an income its only recently they have started to pay councillors properly my car isnt paid by the council its paid for by my business
2599855 i dont get involved in council politics for any self gain i get driven by whats happening in the community thats why i get re elected if wee jeannie needs something done charlie cefferty goes and does it
2599856 i am going to try and have better time management and work from home more in my office because at the moment i dont have any spare time
2599857 councillors expenses are subject to regular and periodic audits as part of the normal internal and external audit arrangements beyond publishing annually the details of such expenses the council would not consider it appropriate to comment on individual claims
2599858 the uk government is deeply concerned by the violence in georgia
2599859 the escalation in fighting is dangerously destabilising and there is also the threat of civilian losses on a large scale
2599860 reports of fighting and bombing outside south ossetia are especially disturbing as they represent a broadening and deepening of the conflict
2599861 the uk believes it is vital for leaderships on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2599862 the uk will be discussing with all our partners how to stop the spread of violence secure a ceasefire and get talks under way
2599863 georgia has been attacked by a formidable force it is a brutal attack with the use of air force tanks and even the trademark cyber attack
2599864 what they are fighting over in king lear is the land so the land has got to have a quality to it which we feel scotland has
2599865 what scotland gives us is its epicness and its beauty its just amazing
2599866 we are going to have a look at all of them
2599867 the one thing that im staying away from is stunt casting so there wont be the american comedian but there will be some really great actors playing smaller roles
2599868 young people are thinking its acceptable fashionable necessary for them to protect themselves to carry a knife just like we made guns unacceptable we should make knives unacceptable
2599869 you need not just young people but parents and other people to say that knives in britain like guns like bullying like racism all these things are unacceptable we have to persuade people its not a thing government can do only people in the community have got to in a sense rise up and say this is unacceptable behaviour
2599870 there are certain boundaries in a decent society you dont cross and these boundaries are cultural because in america it is acceptable for many people to carry guns its not in britain i think in britain weve got to make it as unacceptable to carry knives i think most decent people in our country would want to do that and i think what you will see over the next few months is this sort of campaign which is led not just by government but people in the country to say get knives off our streets its completely unacceptable
2599871 he is campaigning on change and he has got a great message going out the country about how america can play a bigger part in the world and how america can grow
2599872 im not going to have to worry about him because somebody else down south is going to take him out if that man is elected president hell be shot sure as hell the hate would be so deep down south
2599873 the kkk or someone will assassinate obama if we get a n president all you n s sic will think youve won and that the white people will have to bow to you f that
2599874 we are looking at every possibility and making sure that we have prepared for every conceivable contingency if someone is threatening violence we will go to great lengths to deal with that
2599875 people on these racist and white supremacist websites are being quite careful because they know that if they make a threat they will very likely get a visit from the secret service
2599876 the scary thing out there is the lone wolf phenomenon there are enough crazy people in this movement that it is possible one of them will decide today is the day to kick off the aryan revolution
2599877 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking
2599878 america has spoken candidly and consistently about our concerns over the chinese governments behaviour we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2599879 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century
2599880 democracy and human rights are more important than the olympics
2599881 do you really want to include common table salt a substance that slowly destroys the body over time in your diet everyday and never give your body a break from it
2599882 you can make a good case for using web services if you make simple self describing modular applications that are independent of any component model implementation language transport protocol operating system and platform
2599883 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
2599884 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
2599885 georgia clash provides a lesson on the united states need for russia
2599886 que la raz n es igual en todos los hombres sin embargo no todos llegan a la verdad por falta de un m todo
2599887 russia is fond of saying georgia is in our backyard
2599888 but its reasonable to ask what difference does that make these nations are independent countries that have the right to chart their own future
2599889 russia has resented this break up of the old soviet union
2599890 they have been looking for an opportunity to wean people back
2599891 gori is the staging post for the georgian military heading towards the front in south ossetia
2599892 on saturday morning we were talking to and filming a number of very fresh faced looking georgian recruits called up as part of president saakashvilis full mobilisation of the military on friday
2599893 they looked relaxed and calm all of a sudden the sound of a warplane was heard overhead and there was a huge explosion not too far away
2599894 they scattered like flies they didnt know what to do these men were not hardened troops by any manner of means
2599895 there were cars driving in all directions carrying the injured
2599896 we got reports from witnesses and civilians that outside villages had also been hit
2599897 we have seen a number of russian aerial strikes throughout the morning they have certainly hit a georgian military installation
2599898 we cant tell how many casualties are inside it is blocked off there is a munitions depot inside and there are shells exploding
2599899 we have seen a number of injured civilians being led away we have seen elderly people being led away we have seen families heading out of gori fearing the worst and heading towards tbilisi and hoping they will find some sort of the safety there
2599900 the battle lines in this conflict are becoming extremely ugly they are no longer just inside south ossetia russia has been making air incursions into georgian territory
2599901 soldiers have been running through the streets as well as civilians fleeing for safety
2599902 we saw the impact of the air strikes and we have also seen that the russians missed their targets at least once and hit a residential apartment block
2599903 two buildings are on fire with civilians inside we saw at least one man pulled out dead and were told that a number of people were killed or injured
2599904 there are claims from the georgian side that several georgian military bases were bombed by russian aircraft and a port in the south of the country on the black sea coast a long way from gori
2599905 clearly the russians are choosing a lot of targets around the country
2599906 the planes are bombing us i am sitting here in the basement fire is raging above us let somebody come and help us where are the peacekeepers i am sitting here with other people
2599907 my son has been killed why does nobody come to save us
2599908 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined building in cars
2599909 there will be four or five people singing with music about god
2599910 there was a slight safety risk for women wearing normal bras with metal parts underneath a bullet proof vest
2599911 if the vest is hit by a projectile this can have an impact on the metal bit in the bra underneath and cause injuries
2599912 they said we should go smoke some weed and were talking about being in a strip bar some really explicit things
2599913 on elviss side and on my side too i have twin brothers and then of course elvis had a twin brother who died at birth
2599914 high up in a stained glass window in the war memorial is the horseman faithful and true from the bibles book of revelation on his cloak is a swastika even as the mortar was drying in the walls this ancient symbol of fortune was appearing in the skies over europe the insignia of a man who like the rider on the white horse would smite the nations and rule over them with a rod of iron adolf hitler
2599915 king james iv was able to spy on his subjects gathered in the great hall though a little barred window up and to the right of the fireplace
2599916 prior to mikhail gorbachevs visit to the castle in 1984 the kgb asked that the lug be bricked up on security grounds
2599917 mr gorbachev never made it to the castle on that occasion for that very morning he received news of the death of his predecessor as general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union konstantin chernenko
2599918 many people assumed they knew virtually all these was to know about edinburgh castle but these stories have shown that there is always more to learn
2599919 giving a little bit of humanity to a place as austere and dignified as the castle is wonderful we want to whet peoples appetites and entice them to come and see these real oddities which make the castle such a unique place to visit
2599920 the swastika was added in the aftermath of the first world war but before the second world war when it was appropriated by the nazis
2599921 apart from anything else it is part of a stunningly beautiful window
2599922 the whole point of the lairds lug is that it allows you to overhear the conversation below the kgb really didnt like the idea and insisted it had to be blocked off before gorbachev would come in
2599923 they wanted to make sure nobody could eavesdrop or fire a gun at him from up there the castle were happy to go along with the request on the basis that it was entirely reversible i used to use the room as an office and one day people marched in and started bricking it up
2599924 it is a symbol that still arouses deep emotions in people as we saw from the reaction to prince harry wearing one in fancy dress
2599925 the government should be supporting many other organisations who are also vying for the governments attention we dont have anything against the sif but it isnt wise to throw so much money at this organisation people are very upset about it
2599926 providing every document detailed on the rrri application form is not a mandatory requirement of securing grant funding like every other one of the 33 organisations that won funding they provided sufficient information for the process of independent evaluation led by officials to take place
2599927 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2599928 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2599929 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2599930 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and my core beliefs i recognised my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2599931 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2599932 it wasnt very clear how and when that was going to happen it isnt reasonable to fund that unless there is a clear benefit
2599933 high profile projects such as the scotland funds often attract detractors criticism over delivery is in this case facile especially given our scarce resources and we note that none of the critics are prepared to be identified your readers can draw their own conclusions
2599934 the problem was one of inadequate funding the private sector had not supported us to levels we thought were necessary and the scottish government for their own reasons have decided also not to take this forward
2599935 as is the case with all funding applications a robust business case must be provided demonstrating the merit of the project and linking to the scottish governments strategic objectives
2599936 is going to meet the principals basically to advertisement update them on the progress so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2599937 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue
2599938 the june 4 suspension of humanitarian operations is estimated to have affected more than 1 5 million zimbabweans already this years poor harvest means that 5 million zimbabweans will face a severe food crisis if the ban is not lifted
2599939 we are concerned that more than two weeks after the signing of the memorandum of understanding and despite our diplomatic appeals we have seen no concrete steps taken to carry out this commitment
2599940 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2599941 and when their roosts are disrupted or their normal prey grow scarce homo sapiens become a pretty easy meal
2599942 right now we are managing but it is a very difficult situation
2599943 ive never experienced anything like this weve drilled our mountains full of holes looking for water this situation will have a long term impact on our flora and fauna
2599944 which also fully states my opinion on abortion there is no gray area and i do not keep you guessing on what my standpoint is on this topic of abortion now the thing that was in
2599945 well if this person has no money then where are they going to get the money to have an
2599946 wouldnt it be better for a mother to have a baby in her arms than on her conscious
2599947 that leads in my case and i would think in other cases as well to people saying well lets just not reinsulate the roof
2599948 we have no problem with the use of solar energy
2599949 marburg is already a leader when it comes to the use of solar energy but up until now theyve always tried to convince people rather than forcing them
2599950 its unfortunate that they decided to compel people because i think you breed opponents that way rather than friends of solar energy
2599951 we have a serious energy problem with the older homes
2599952 before solar installations were the exception and their absence was the rule
2599953 we want to get to the point where the opposite is the case
2599954 police in st andrews will work with the universitys student support services and associations to curb antisocial behaviour during events such as raisin week officers including our own university liaison officer will run a series of roadshows during freshers week to explain the consequences of drinking excessively with regard to personal safety and what effects having a criminal record could have on their chances of getting a job or visa application
2599955 the student community is aware that excessively drunken or criminal behaviour would naturally jeopardise the future of the celebrations not so much because the university might take action but because fife constabulary would arrest them
2599956 the university and police are trying to calm down the wilder aspects of raisin week the main problem was simply people drinking too much
2599957 we are going to be giving raisin week leaflets to every student which will advise them to enjoy themselves while drinking and acting sensibly
2599958 i am a loner who may not have any real good friends at all but thats just the way it is
2599959 if id been a bit more savvy id still be on television
2599960 obviously theres a lot of women whove not been happy with the way i was with them ive never raised my hand to a woman or assaulted a woman but i might have disrespected women or not been proper with women i did have to change my behaviour after the allegations im just aware of everything all the time now always thinking could that be misconstrued as something else because obviously thats what happened before
2599961 i was a single guy with a lot of girlfriends i put my hands up to that but theres a canyon of difference between assault and seeing girls at no point ever did i put a woman in a situation that was not comfortable nothing happened
2599962 everyone is so scared and youre aware of how fragile and fickle it is
2599963 the population of south ossetia is 75 000 and our camps in darfur have 150 000 people in one camp so it should be relatively straightforward
2599964 right now its very unclear what access is allowed into south ossetia if we cannot get in we will have to focus on people that are leaving the area because if its a hostile environment access will be restricted even if we do get in i dont know how easy it is for us to move around
2599965 if it stays confined in south ossetia it is probably quite manageable from a humanitarian point of view but if the conflict does move to involve abkhazia another separatist area of georgia or if it causes a destabilisation of the government we could be looking at a much longer and more serious situation
2599966 there is nervousness among our people on the ground that the conflict will spread to tbilisi which would make it much more serious people are surprised by the degree of engagement by the russians
2599967 we also demand that the united nations and international society do not ignore the nuclear weapons of north korea pakistan and israel as well as the suspicions of nuclear development by iran but take stern measures against these countries
2599968 india whose nuclear cooperation with the us is a concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2599969 the bottom line for us is this is the way to get the cooperation we want this is the way to get the support for non proliferation
2599970 young mothers in rural areas can feel quite isolated and we are an outlet for them to go out and meet new people
2599971 when young people leave school they often dont know how to cook
2599972 home economics does not seem to be one of the core subjects any more and a lot of parents are out working and dont have time to explain to their children how to cook either
2599973 there are many people who are just used to putting things in a microwave
2599974 the enthusiasm is there but a lot of the younger members do need to basically start from the very beginning
2599975 in my own area we ran a basic cooking school and showed people how to cook simple things such as pancakes and plain biscuits
2599976 it worked well and we got a lot of positive feedback
2599977 if he needs to blow his own trumpet well fine
2599978 but my mother who was a simple housewife she showed me the snake when i was a child
2599979 our regular customers know that to get the widest choice of low fares and availability they need to book early
2599980 scheduled airlines normally only put their inventory on sale nine months before so clearly the likes of globespan would be of interest to cruisers
2599981 i am keen to see the phasing out of existing contract cleaning in hospitals and i would want to see no more in the future with cleaning kept in house
2599982 the introduction of contract cleaning tenders to hospital cleaning started the decline in quality in hospital cleaning
2599983 we would welcome any commitment by the government to remove contracted out cleaning from scotlands hospitals but we also need to employ more cleaners and supply the resources that they require providing a quality service not the cheapest
2599984 cleaning services at the royal infirmary of edinburgh are provided by consort as part of the pfi contract and we would have to take account of the legal obligations of that contract in any changes to guidance on cleaning services for nhs scotland
2599985 syrias election to the board while under investigation for secretly building an undeclared nuclear reactor not suited for peaceful purposes would make a mockery
2599986 the syrians said that a visit at this time was inopportune
2599987 you can all just take a seat there for now well begin shortly
2599988 professor thorton of evocation and professor greeves of enchantments the third professor illiander will be along shortly
2599989 yes and though it would be nice to spend time on longer introductions youre already behind schedule
2599990 ah right you are wed best make our way to the upper room then best of luck
