3150000 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3150001 it seems that this will not change anything but will move us away from resolving the situation

3150014 sono certo che questo doppio confronto con lo slavia praga ce lo giocheremo fino in fondo non dimenticando che ci sar anche la gara di ritorno

3150022 como ud puede ver son muchas y muy graves las diferencias doctrinales que nos separan yo creo que uds hacen una caricatura del cristianismo lo jibarizan es decir lo reducen a un sistema socios econ mico y pol tico y le hacen perder sus grandes valores religiosos yo no puedo prestarme a esto ni pudo patrocinar una reuni n de sacerdotes que con inmensa buena voluntad promueven esto
3150023 despu s de meditar sobre cada uno de los puntos de esta carta sobre su activitud de promoci n de este encuentro de cristianos para el socialismo no puedo negarle que me siento un tanto escandalizado

3150027 i think whats going to happen eventually is ultimately were going to lose a lot of people to imports some people have to lease cars no matter how you look at it
3150028 what were trying to do right now is convert people to financing trying to sell them on the advantages of owning their own cars
3150029 chrysler is offering almost 6 000 in rebates to customers before they even talk to a salesperson
3150030 this is a very aggressive program that combined with low interest rates should counteract any effect not having a lease option would have
3150031 with gas prices being so high we see a lot more customers hanging on to their vehicle especially if it is fuel efficient
3150032 thats probably where chrysler will see a dip in sales
3150033 the letter said that i wouldnt see much of a change if i wanted to purchase a new jeep when my lease is up
3150034 i just dont see how this is true because a person typically puts something like 3 000 down for a lease and if you change that to a down payment on a 30 000 new vehicle purchase your monthly payments would be over 2 000
3150035 i have enjoyed leasing a jeep and if they continued the program i would not have had a second thought about leasing another jeep
3150036 but with this change in policy and the current cost of gas i am going to have to take a look at changing my strategy in choosing a vehicle
3150037 i said we would bring a freshness to the spl and we did that
3150038 but we have to keep doing that week in week out and now we have to focus on the game at inverness who had a great win at the weekend
3150039 were in with the big boys now and we are determined to enjoy it
3150040 i thought it was an entertaining game and we were great
3150041 to go a goal down in the manner we did and to bounce back against a very good side says a lot about the players
3150042 ive said to the players enjoy it because there will be a few hits along the way

3150051 the west is kind of spreading propaganda against russia this is not a case of russia being overly aggressive
3150052 if journalists have already discovered who the guilty parties are then public opinion is not nearly so straightforward
3150053 it is as clear as day that the u s is supporting georgia and propping them up both with money and on tv they the united states are blaming russia for something we did not do
3150054 objectivity is not a typical trait of some western journalists
3150055 saakashvili was put there by the americans by american money he is being paid by the americans and america is funding this conflict
3150056 is it any surprise to you that they the west do not like us
3150057 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3150058 its becoming less valuable to be able to predict it and more valuable to be able to adapt thats not to say you dont develop multiple scenarios you do but the point is that the strategic choices you make can be roughly right the real precision comes from your ability to adapt

3150080 a large body of all source reporting indicates that activists identifying themselves as jihadists although a small percentage of muslims are increasing in both number and geographic dispersion
3150081 greater pluralism and more responsive political systems in muslim majority nations would alleviate some of the grievances jihadists exploit
3150082 four underlying factors are fueling the spread of the jihadist movement 1 entrenched grievances such as corruption injustice and fear of western domination leading to anger humiliation and a sense of powerlessness 2 the iraq jihad
3150083 we assess that the underlying factors fueling the spread of the movement outweigh its vulnerabilities and are likely to do so for the duration of the timeframe of this estimate
3150084 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years

3150126 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3150127 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3150128 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3150129 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3150130 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3150131 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3150132 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3150133 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3150134 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3150135 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3150136 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3150137 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3150138 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3150139 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

3150151 it is always good if you look ahead but we are not questioning whether the world cup will take place in south africa in 2010
3150152 the ioc has just now decided that the ioc session in 2011 will be held in durban that was a historic decision and it is a confirmation in our confidence for the world cup
3150153 we cant return to europe but to reiterate there have been so few natural catastrophes south of the sahara there are other catastrophes but not natural ones
3150154 of course we also had a contingency plan for germany but a european country
3150155 it did not cause any harm as there is some action there now
3150156 i did not want to start the rumors and did not say it like that but it was interpreted in such a way and that did no harm
3150157 the world cup has led to a boom in the construction industry and that in turn has led to a problem with the supply of electricity

3150160 if the world cup in south africa is not a good one others will have to decide what my fate should be i have been voted into office till 2011
3150161 it will be a good world cup with a new dimension
3150162 you will not be able to repeat the summer fairytale that germany was
3150163 if i worried about that i could never sleep as so much happens in soccer
3150164 every day there is a report that a player has died or a coach there are 260 million people in soccer all over the world as many as there are in america
3150165 i am worried about security ahead of every fifa competition
3150166 todays world has problems something can happen anywhere in the world security problems occur wherever we play soccer
3150167 we are aware that security is a specific problem in south africa that it occupies us and that even more it occupies the south african government
3150168 together we will have to find a way that security is ensured but we cant ensure this security
3150169 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
3150170 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3150171 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3150172 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3150173 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3150174 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3150175 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3150176 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3150177 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3150178 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3150179 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3150180 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3150181 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3150182 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3150183 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3150184 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3150185 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3150186 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3150187 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3150188 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3150189 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3150190 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3150191 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3150192 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3150193 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3150194 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3150195 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3150196 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3150197 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3150198 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3150199 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3150200 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

3150202 in nearly every category measured ad effectiveness scores on branded content sites were numerically higher than on the web in general on generic portals or on ad networks branded content sites deliver better advertising results
3150203 nearly all forms of online media have an important role to play throughout the purchase funnel
3150204 but branded content sites have a notably greater impact at the points where consumers are establishing brand preference and making purchase decisions
3150205 branded content sites are doing a particularly effective job of delivering results with developing advertising formats including video advertising and rich media
3150206 just as we have seen with offline media the value of context cannot be underestimated a point that is clearly reaffirmed in this study a sponsorship on a brand name site delivers the power of that brand to the advertiser associated with that content

3150209 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3150210 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3150211 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it

3150233 the slowdown in other economies has weakened the demand for chinese products
3150234 meanwhile the value of imports has jumped on surging international commodities prices even if the volume may have remained roughly the same
3150235 clearly policymakers have come to a conclusion that their focus will shift from simply curbing inflation in the previous months to both containing inflation and maintaining fast economic growth
3150236 the producer price index rose quite fast which poses a rather big threat
3150237 the interest rate will definitely have to be raised although china is trying to delay the next hike
3150238 its like you build a dam to fend off inflation but it will collapse when the problem gets too big
3150239 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
3150240 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers
3150241 courage is being scared to death but saddling up anyway
3150242 because the climate change crisis is at its very bottom a crisis of lifestyle of character even the big problem is nothing more or less than the sum total of countless little everyday choices most of them made by us consumer spending represents 70 percent of our economy and most of the rest of them made in the name of our needs and desires and preferences

3150278 on sunday morning the player and his representatives informed the club it was their desire to invoke an exit clause for 10 million euros and today an offer for that amount was received from aston villa
3150279 my ambition has always been to play for my national team and i believe that playing in the biggest league in the world for aston villa will help me realise that
3150280 when i told martin bain on sunday that i wanted to leave i did so with sadness the rangers supporters have been fantastic to me but i am young and want to play at the highest level and i hope they will always welcome me back i want to thank them for everything
3150281 this has come as a surprise and i am disappointed carlos cu llar has been a great player for the football club and inevitably there has been speculation about him playing in the premiership
3150282 well so is an enema whats the big deal yuk yuk yuk
3150283 i felt rather uncomfortable cupping my hand round the shaft of its neck
3150284 to be out here at a great golf course helping out the community all of those together really make this a special event
3150285 we have almost 1 800 volunteers this year which is about 400 more than weve ever had in the past which hopefully is real indicative of the enthusiasm of the momentum behind the tournament
3150286 they are vital every single day from the security to what the players see to just how the tournament feels the hospitality they show the fans they really are the face of the tournament in a lot of ways and were real proud of them
3150287 i spend seven or eight days out here from sunday through sunday and its well worth the time to give back to the community is something special
3150288 the homicide was committed during the commission of armed robbery potentially a burglary first degree kidnapping and also it was for pecuniary gain for financial reasons
3150289 they would like to have closure in this case as anyone would
3150290 this has been horrible for them they have to live with it every day and theyll have to live with it every day for the rest of their lives
3150291 it is very big news in the town of robbins
3150292 extremely big because we are a very small country town
3150293 he seemed like a hometown boy and that was really upsetting
3150294 they are really sweet and honest people and good people in the community
3150295 i have seen it on every channel all weekend and after a while enough is enough
3150296 every time a patch falls on the floor a kitten dies
3150297 were within 90 days of the election and people are thinking about wow who am i going to vote for and am i even registered to vote
3150298 then the phone call comes and says hey if youre not registered to vote well be happy to get you set up over the phone
3150299 and you will all of a sudden if you check your credit report start noticing that there are charge accounts set up under your name an social security number loans being taken out
3150300 everything that we have requires a voter signature so thats a hard piece of paper in my possession
3150301 charlotte mecklenburg police department is going to look in to the factors that led up to this crash with the fire truck
3150302 but each year firefighters respond to nearly 90 000 calls for service and we never want something like this to happen
3150303 theres more to life than watching daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3150304 then i opened the door on thursday and he was back it was such a shock i thought well its a bit of mischief but at least he hasnt been put through the window
3150305 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon and his angels fought back but he was not strong enough and they lost their place in heaven the great dragon was hurled down that ancient serpent called the devil or satan who leads the whole world astray he was hurled to the earth and his angels with him
3150306 now the serpent rev 12 9 20 2 was more subtile than any beast of the field which the lord god had made
3150307 now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them
3150308 clearly the effort is to collect more information about peoples noncriminal behaviors
3150309 terrorism is a crime if we focus on the criminal aspects of it there would be no need to change the law
3150310 a little bit of tudor a little bit of colonial
3150311 its that mix of styles that make it charming and appealing
3150312 now that i look back it i think oh my god how did i have such an inadequate kitchen it was very very tiny
3150313 a lot of homeowners they love a house in an existing area they love the area but there are certain things they dont really like about the house
3150314 so by renovating they accomplish whether it be a new kitchen a new master bath a master bedroom suite
3150315 you can do easy renovation like this on the low side of 30 000 40 000 but you can easily spend 100 000 it depends on granite counter tops it depends on the cabinetry
3150316 renovation can get very expensive and every once in a while you get a homeowner that prices themselves out of the neighborhood
3150317 the more research that you do and the more you talk to people i think the better
3150318 so my advice is leave these men alone if they are teaching and doing these things merely on their own it will soon be overthrown but if it is of god you will not be able to stop them you may even find yourselves fighting against god
3150319 the person you love the least is how you love jesus

3150352 they were two nice hard working respectable people who have come to the uk for the best of reasons to get a good education
3150353 we have no known motive for this savage and brutal attack
3150354 this is a tragic loss of two young lives and our thoughts are with their families as they try to come to terms with what has happened
3150355 it is understandable after whats happened that theres a great deal of concern in the community and were addressing that with local officers carrying out extra patrols in the area and will be speaking to residents individually to reassure them all is being done to find the offenders

3150366 each of the 21 cities will gather emissions data for their municipal functions such as their fire and police departments government buildings and waste services which will help cities compare how they are doing
3150367 they will also assess emissions from the city as a whole
3150368 if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
3150369 the process should really lead to the beginnings of a fundamental restructuring of how cities consume energy

3150381 we will make adjustments to ensure sustained operations and dont anticipate their departure will result in any significant long term impact on the overall security situation in iraq
3150382 they were an important and valued partner and contributed quite a bit to the improved security in wassit province where the bulk of their forces operated with us and our iraqi security force partners
3150383 i do not think that the departure of the georgian soldiers will have an impact on the situation in the province
3150384 there were always language and poor performance problems our security forces can fill any vacuum
3150385 they did not try to give us services instead they were a source of annoyance by delaying us at their checkpoints and mocking the simple locals
3150386 we want to thank them for the great support theyve given the coalition and we wish them well

3150401 it is more similar to strains previously identified in europe italy asia afghanistan and the middle east iran in 2007
3150402 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3150403 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3150404 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3150405 uncertainty about virus spread and transmission is a major challenge for control campaigns increased surveillance is key to monitor the situation and keep track of virus spread

3150414 argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined

3150421 when hes up and going the chest is out and hes waltzing around as soon as hes had a bad couple of minutes the shoulders go down and his teammates see it
3150422 i think it spreads like a bit of cancer hes really got to have better body language when its not going so good for him

3150535 county bank is an established financial institution with over 30 years of history in the central valley and remains committed to its customers and their success whether they are the business banking customers who support our local economies or the personal banking customers who make up the fabric of our communities

3150537 all banks continue to face unprecedented and challenging market conditions and county bank is no exception however our company is taking the necessary steps to ensure our future success and growth we will get through this and we will continue to serve our communities our customers and our friends
3150538 we have now reviewed 80 of the aggregate balance at 2007 year end of our commercial and real estate loan portfolios and have found that some impaired loans are still performing and that certain borrowers have granted the company additional collateral
3150539 the additional property appraisals and the independent loan portfolio review were costly and necessary expenses but this is what you do when faced with a challenging credit environment the bank is stronger for having taken these necessary and painful steps as the central valley s economy stabilizes the bank will be positioned to move forward with business as usual
3150540 approximately 11 million of the second quarter 13 9 million loan provision can be attributed to nine loans and three of those loans account for approximately 8 9 million of the provision
3150541 roughly 0 41 of the number of loans in the bank s commercial loan portfolio or 0 21 of the total loan portfolio contributed to the second quarter loan loss provision additionally there are certain segments of the portfolio that remain strong especially in areas where the central valley s economy is expanding such as agribusiness and exports
3150542 county bank is a community bank that will be affected when the community is struggling just as it will prosper when the community prospers
3150543 that is why we are committed to the success of our communities our customers and our customers businesses it is those businesses that will help our communities emerge from this challenging time and county bank will continue to serve those businesses helping them to be strong profitable and growing economic engines in the central valley just like county bank

3150545 gastar has been quite active over the past year positioning the company for further growth and for the creation of significant value for our shareholders
3150546 our continued success in the deep bossier play along with the positive results in new south wales and our new marcellus shale acreage positions gastar for significant reserve growth and coinciding increases in shareholder value
3150547 though texas production in the second quarter was down from the previous quarter we anticipate continued growth in texas volumes for the remainder of 2008 as we move toward another year of record production
3150548 in new south wales we are excited to be moving our coal seam gas project towards first sales around year end the early results of our corehole pilot program have been very encouraging and we are looking forward to getting the multi lateral production program underway in september
3150549 we are also very enthusiastic about the growth potential of our marcellus shale position in appalachia we believe we have established an attractive acreage position in the core area for the marcellus play with a concentration in northern west virginia and southwest pennsylvania where operational issues regarding water sources water disposal and gas transportation are likely to be minimized initially our position will require limited initial capital expenditures while allowing gastar to capture a significant resource potential in one of the true up and coming resource plays in north america our strategy and the location of our assets will also allow gastar to benefit from the efforts of other e amp p and service companies as the operational challenges in the marcellus play are resolved

3150556 we have been hitting all of our production goals and maintained cost targets on the nextmap usa program
3150557 in the second quarter the seasonal efficiency gains that we realize with summer weather combined with the collection of comparatively flat mid west terrain resulted in the lowest cost yet per square kilometer since the inception of the nextmap program the impact of the recent increases in fuel costs to the company s aircraft operations have been neutralized by continued productivity gains aircraft fuel represents only a small percentage of the total cost of the company s nextmap programs
3150558 during the second quarter we continued to make excellent progress towards achieving our goals for 2008 our results are in line with our guidance and the strong order rate in the first half of the year significantly increasing our backlog positions us well to achieve our operating plan for the year our growth in orders was driven by demand for the new biochrom microliter spectrophotometer the launch of the harvard apparatus physiology catalog worldwide sales of panlab behavior products and a large order from china for plate readers additionally we have completed the relocation of our asys and anthos product lines from austria to our biochrom facility in the uk based on these trends we are comfortable with our guidance for the year of 0 36 0 38 non gaap adjusted eps and 94 0 96 0 million in revenue our guidance for the third quarter is 0 07 0 09 non gaap adjusted eps and revenue of 21 0 23 0 million guidance for both the year and the third quarter exclude the impact of any additional acquisitions

3150735 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3150736 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3150737 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited

3150799 i urge every american who may be watching this broadcast right now to call their senators their congressmen the white house and tell george bush to get out america does not need to intervene in this war america needs to stop supporting georgia what saakashvili is doing is no better than what saddam hussein did and if george bush is supporting that like hes supporting georgia hes no better than saddam hussein

3150811 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3150812 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3150813 bring top minor league professional mens basketball back to cleveland
3150814 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3150815 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

3150818 last year we were able to hold a roster spot open for gary as he attempted to make a monumental comeback after he underwent a knee scope last week we are unfortunately not in a position to hold a roster spot this year we are releasing gary today in hopes he will be able to continue his rehab and get back into the nfl either with another team or possibly with the browns gary has made tremendous strides thus far and we believe he can play professional football again in the future
3150819 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3150820 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3150821 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3150822 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3150828 will my teacher be nice where will i sit will the other kids like me
3150829 a big part of a successful first week is establishing a routine and explaining where the bathroom is what happens when you go to gym class and when to expect recess
3150830 well before school starts focus on choosing sleep exercise healthy foods and time together
3150831 practice school bedtimes a week before school starts so that the new routine is established
3150832 we often plan an event to celebrate the end of summer and welcome the new school season
3150833 you dont want a child to have a bad experience because hes asking to go to the bathroom every half hour and the teacher says no thinking he doesnt need to go so frequently but really he does
3150834 i try to think of all the positive things that they like about school and i talk about them as much as possible
3150835 i ask about friends they havent seen over the summer i also look at my kids and note anything different that their friends will notice such as a new hairstyle or if theyve grown over the summer i never mention homework or teachers they werent crazy about
3150836 be a role model throughout the year not just during school time for example show how much you like reading or talk about math and measuring when youre making a recipe together
3150837 encourage the child to speak up and let the teacher know if theyre having problems this is especially important if a child is getting bullied which can happen even on the first day they need to know they can and should talk to the teacher
3150838 ive been celibate for a year and starting to think i may never have sex again

3150847 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3150848 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3150849 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3150850 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3150851 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3150852 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3150853 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3150854 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3150855 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3150856 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3150857 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3150858 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3150859 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3150860 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3150861 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3150862 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3150863 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3150864 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3150865 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3150866 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3150867 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3150868 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3150869 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3150870 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3150871 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3150872 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3150873 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3150874 a tie up with spielberg means more business more visibility and greater exposure on the international front
3150875 clearly there would be some savings in our overhead as well as our marketing distribution and development spend
3150876 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3150877 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3150878 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3150879 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3150880 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3150881 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3150882 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3150883 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3150884 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3150885 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3150886 the job will be done as soon as the weather makes it possible
3150887 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3150888 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3150889 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3150890 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3150891 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3150892 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3150893 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3150894 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3150895 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3150896 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3150897 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3150898 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3150899 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3150900 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3150901 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3150902 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3150903 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3150904 celebrity distorts democracy by giving the rich beautiful and famous more authority than they deserve
3150905 democratic party insiders have revealed that george clooney and obama regularly send texts and emails to each other and speak by phone at least twice a week

3150909 it was a very canada unfriendly day with the oil price down the gold price down sharply and naturally the canadian dollar following suit
3150910 the parts that did well south of the border we dont have a lot of things like technology and those sorts of areas
3150911 they are priced right theyve improved their merchandise in terms of apparel and resonating well with consumers they are just very well positioned
3150912 the inventory level is very lean and clean at many retailers everybody has been planning for this challenging environment
3150913 wal mart is well poised to gain market share and improve profitability in the current consumer environment
3150914 the real issue is what they are going to say going forward and the health of the consumer
3150915 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
3150916 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3150917 some 600 000 hybrid cars are to be manufactured by the end of the iranian calendar year ending march 20 2009
3150918 these 600 000 hybrid vehicles will make up 33 percent of the countrys total auto production

3150920 its a great way to keep my brothers name living on
3150921 devilfish ulliott is one of the most successful formidable and well known
3150922 those are rumors right now and i we arent going to comment on something like that that is pretty outrageous
3150923 i really think this will be a precursor of a larger american role
3150924 putting nicholson in there is recognition that weve got to get more us engagement in the headquarters
3150925 they are laying the necessary groundwork so that the really painful but necessary decisions will fall to the next administration including the us taking over in a significant way
3150926 the intentions of the laws are exceedingly clear centralization expanding control over society
3150927 the constitutional reform generated doubts criticisms and reservations among those who had previously voted for the president and contributed to decembers defeat seeing as the laws reproduce aspects of the constitutional reform it should generate the same apprehensions about the governments intentions
3150928 many of the 26 laws violate what the people denied him on dec 2
3150929 they were the only government that called us to participate in the creation of the constitution never before had a government given us that right
3150930 people feel betrayed they are going to make him pay in these elections
3150931 the law decrees lit the match of conscious popular reaction
3150932 ch vez had a plan a and a plan b
3150933 approving the constitutional reforms through a vote the revolution using democratic channels represented plan a and the enabling law was plan b
3150934 if the president leaps over the constitution by inserting law decrees that were rejected what stops him from introducing indefinite reelection what public power can put the brakes on what the government wants to do
3150935 ch vez moves in zigzag knocking down institutions one at a time so he can do what he likes sometimes theres a step back he lost the reform then he launches 26 laws
3150936 if the taser was indeed the cause of death this could be an interesting case
3150937 given the historical corruption of law enforcement in the area and the fact that the young man was tased nine times something is definitely wrong with this picture
3150938 we didnt get this negative reaction when nightsticks were used to split heads open but because of the technology and what it does the media have really exacerbated the issue of the taser
3150939 the upside of the taser far outweighs the unfortunate abuse or downside
3150940 were seeing injuries that wouldnt normally happen on a routine traffic stop and all of a sudden theyre happening
3150941 my guess is the majority of foreclosures that will take place are for families whose homes are underwater or whose current income is not sufficient thanks to a burst of inflation and stagnation of real incomes
3150942 that doesnt sound like much but it can make the difference between being able to comfortably service the mortgage and significant tightening of the belt in order to make the payments especially if you have a long commute
3150943 ive lost everything i had more when i started the business in late 2000 and i thought then i was taking a huge risk
3150944 ive been slowly selling it off to keep afloat and try to find gainful employment
3150945 there are so many elements involved in this that realistically its terrifying
3150946 will be people who just truly cant afford the mortgage payment
3150947 if someone earning wages in your family was laid off and food has gone up and gas has gone up theres no more way to reach
3150948 usually the foreclosures start after the recession starts so it would not be surprising to get more foreclosures that were spurred by those kind of problems since the ones weve seen so far were generated by other factors
3150949 a lot more homes probably could have been saved but people walked away and never talked to their bank

3150957 post pe care si l a ocupat prin concurs si in care a facut lucruri foarte bine
3150958 we have been at the forefront of the climate change issue for years a large percentage of our electricity already comes from renewable energy sources and we are in the tropics we dont have problems heating up our homes and buildings during the winter
3150959 the first thing is measuring what the emissions actually are then were looking at ways that we can do our agricultural practices better to reduce the emissions in addition to production we are also involved in transportation so we are also looking at ways of being more fuel efficient
3150960 you can see the growth here in the tropics its incredible in four months they can grow 50 to 60cm
3150961 the tree starts absorbing carbon dioxide from when its a seedling especially during the first 10 to 15 years its a very efficient way of absorbing carbon from the atmosphere
3150962 costa rica has been the only country in central america ahead of everyone else in terms of protecting the environment
3150963 i believe this is the first step to mitigate even more the impact they have on climate change the only thing i see is a little bit problematic is by 2021 its a huge target
3150964 the real challenge for costa rica is transportation most of our emissions come from this sector we really have to start making changes in how costa ricans are moving but as the economy grows if more people want to have their own cars we have to take that in to account
3150965 we are in the right position in this country to be the crucible for the changes that the rest of the world is looking for we cannot let it fail we need to get everyone on our side to make this small experiment in something very radical but very necessary to work
3150966 our polling shows that although obama does decently up there
3150967 the kind of margins coming out of there for the democrats are not anything likely to be what you see in other statewide elections
3150968 that a lot of the problems in the sex industry were not actually related to the work itself
3150969 about the conditions in which the work was done and the amount of power the worker had
3150970 political discussions to how to keep a wig on during an orgy
3150971 our aim is for people who work in the sex industry to enjoy a full range human civil and labour rights
3150972 we want to be treated like the rest of you we want equality and that means enjoying the same rights as people in other industries and people in other occupations
3150973 there is nothing inherently exploitative or degrading about consensual sexual behaviour regardless of its motivation
3150974 there is abuse and exploitation and rape and coercion it would be obscene to say that doesnt happen
3150975 the history of the left shows we didnt go out and rescue the miners take them away and give them a wash and say come and do this you will be much happier we gave them rights we gave them bargaining power and that is the solution to exploitation to give them rights and resources not to rescue and redeem them
3150976 decriminalisation will not solve all the problems associated with the sex industry
3150977 its not going to wave a magic wand and mean an end to stigma and violence and exploitation
3150978 an essential first step to letting the light of day shine in upon the industry
3150979 there are no statistics that are authentic particularly in a situation where the more underground something is pushed the less likely it will be we can generate reliable statistics
3150980 sex workers were explicitly excluded from the consultation about passing the law
3150981 very well intentioned and really mean what they are saying
3150982 one of the oldest feminist slogans was no means no
3150983 for me the only moral and social bottom line is consent
3150984 i go to conferences with academics and i receive far more abuse than i would ever tolerate from someone who has attempting to become a client of mine
3150985 if a guy is on his knees and he is kissing my feet and giving me a foot massage and i am drinking champagne that he has bought me how far up my leg does his mouth have to get before i feel exploited
3150986 i accept there are people probably a lot of people who are doing this job and dont want to do it
3150987 but id ask if the survey distinguished between wanting to leave because they were sick of doing a job which is stigmatised marginalised and derided or if their problem was with the actual having sex for money part in australia a survey showed women able to work legally had similar job satisfaction to women in the rest of the population
3150988 lets acknowledge all of these things and lets try and separate the bad from the good and target the bad
3150989 it was that democrats are united around a commitment to provide every american access to affordable comprehensive health care
3150990 should have the option of keeping the coverage they have or choosing from a wide array of health insurance plans including many private health insurance options and a public plan
3150991 in the winter of 1873 many ho chunk people were removed to the nebraska reservation from wisconsin traveling in cattle cars on trains
3150992 this was a horrific experience for the people as many elders women and children suffered and died
3150993 take the battle to the enemy disrupt his plans and confront the worst threats before they emerge
3150994 a vivid and compelling demonstration of americas ability to win swift and total victory
3150995 unequalled in its excellence by anything in the annals of war
3150996 that far surpasses the capabilities of such previous would be hegemons as rome britain and napoleonic france
3150997 fabled generals such as erwin rommel and heinz guderian seem positively incompetent by comparison
3150998 weve applied the new powers of technology to strike an enemy force with speed and incredible precision by a combination of creative strategies and advanced technologies we are redefining war on our terms in this new era of warfare we can target a regime not a nation
3150999 the american people fell in love again with their armed forces
3151000 whats the point of having this superb military that youre always talking about if we cant use it
3151001 appropriated the entire earth and was ready to flood the most obscure areas of it with troops at a moments notice
3151002 just about no mission is impossible for the united states military
3151003 this is a voting block that has never been open before and it has opened up at such a time as this
3151004 the majority of people to get their rights restored are democrats and if we get them registered we might overtake the state
3151005 could certainly swing an election but there are millions and millions of voters
3151006 theres also the perception for some reason that they are all black and all democrats and thats certainly not the case
3151007 it kind of offended my notion of justice you can serve your time and still have your rights taken away
3151008 i studied the history of black disenfranchisement in the state we had the grandfather laws and the tissue paper ballots when a black man came to vote they gave him a tissue paper ballot that was later thrown out there were lynchings and riots weve got a long history of depriving people of the right to vote in florida
3151009 this has been a major major thing in my heart
3151010 the information is not filtering to the people who need it
3151011 its catch as catch can as people learn about it
3151012 if this country lawyer could figure this out you mean the government couldnt do it
3151013 not knowing what to do makes people not want to go do it
3151014 you dont realize how far behind you are until you get back in the mainstream maybe fear maybe procrastination just kind of paralyzed me and i just didnt go forward with it
3151015 alone should secure his reputation forever but really if you listen to just about anything in the last quarter centurys worth of rap and r amp b you can still hear him
3151016 and i thought to myself just turn on the radio and listen to some of your hip hop stuff thats what ive done lately
3151017 the hippest edgiest track ever to win an academy award for best song
3151018 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3151019 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3151020 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3151021 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3151022 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3151023 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3151024 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3151025 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3151026 bar federal agencies from assessing the emissions from projects that contribute to global warming and its effect on species and habitats
3151027 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
3151028 program information software code or command that would assist another in any material way to circumvent or otherwise attack the security of the fare media system
3151029 the mbta will reserve comment on the substance of the presentation until staff has had a sufficient period of time to thoroughly review the information and meet with the students and their professor
3151030 this is not simply saying we did it arent we inventive its also providing a tool to help accomplish this our understanding is that these would likely be software tools that would make it easier to analyze the cards
3151031 our goal was to develop a profitable company that was socially and environmentally responsible
3151032 there is no russian military attack there is peace enforcement in south ossetia
3151033 along with military aggression the russian federation is blocking georgian internet portals
3151034 on request of the president of georgia the president of the republic of poland has provided the web site of the president of poland for dissemination of information
3151035 poti serves as a vital energy transit route to europe
3151036 over the past 48 hours russian forces have killed over 100 georgian civilians and soldiers after targeting residential complexes in georgia as well as airports bases and other vital infrastructure
3151037 however the spokesperson acknowledged that as yet georgia could not confirm that russia had been responsible as the causes were still
3151038 this result validates the prospect for economic production of pha polymer in switchgrass and demonstrates for the first time an important tool for enhancing switchgrass for value added performance as a
3151039 it is the trademark owners burden to police its mark
3151040 we believe that legal errors were made in this decision and we have every reason to believe that the circuit court will look at them afresh and hopefully agree with us
3151041 if one were a flea market operator and you become aware that counterfeiting is going on with the individual sellers at the flea market you have a duty to investigate it
3151042 the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3151043 once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3151044 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting the best way to stop counterfeiting is ongoing collaboration between companies government agencies and law enforcement
3151045 in the event that the foreign courts uphold those rulings ebays going to have to change the way it does business
3151046 if they have the ability to prevent counterfeiting in france and germany then clearly they have the ability to prevent it in the united states
3151047 there are other online sites that have to realize that theyve got to up their game and do at least what ebay is doing if they want to insulate themselves from liability
3151048 so when theyve turned up to the hospital the hospital didnt know anything about it or what was going on
3151049 for a short time st andrews shut down the ambulances coming in and out until we could ascertain what the actual chemical was and that is fair enough too as we didnt want to have any further contamination outside the area
3151050 steve is an experienced and visionary leader whose proven record of success leading online services makes him an ideal person to join our board

3151053 i kind of feel like we are in dr evils secret lair or something
3151054 well this is a much cleaner industry its politically much more popular and its an opportunity to change the world in a positive way whereas in the oil and gas business you are doing more of the same polluting just like you have all those years
3151055 either we develop it here or we watch germany or china or japan develop it and create the jobs there so its very important that the federal government partner with companies like this to make sure we are on the cutting edge
3151056 you are the resurrection and the life we who believe in you will trust even though the enzo died 26 and whoever kills an enzo their career will die too and if you believe this you will see the glory of enzo
3151057 i believe that i am the man like that of a god who was to come into the world and save the enzo
3151058 enzo if that dumb ass griffin not had been here your greatness would not have died
3151059 could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man griffin have kept this enzo from dying
3151060 did i not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of enzo
3151061 jalopnik i thank you that you have heard me 42 i knew that you always hear me but i said this for the benefit of the people standing here that they may believe that you sent me
3151062 fire her up and witness the saving of the enzo
3151063 i just want to take it one start at a time for now and finish the year strong

3151071 however the courts wording also makes it clear we need to remain vigilant to oppose future attacks on that freedom
3151072 it is unusual to see such significant movement within the core segments of the christian community
3151073 while there is still a decided preference for senator obama the more conservative element of the christian population is slowly coming to grips with what an obama presidency might be like
3151074 as the finer points of a wide range of issues are clarified by each nominee the initial excitement about senator obama has lost some luster to an increasing number of people whose vote is influenced by their spiritual perspectives
3151075 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3151076 there is no more pressing issue regarding planet earth than global warming every day we hear more reports about the dire consequences we face as a global community if we fail to recognise the cases and fail to fully focus our creative intellect to bring about effective solutions my interest as an artist is to figure out how to incorporate this subject into my work and how to integrate my concern with the physical and spiritual health of both the planet and humanity as a whole

3151087 and you do not have understanding do you not perceive that all that goes into the mouth proceeds into the belly and is cast out into the toilet but the things that come out of the mouth come forth from the heart and this makes the man unclean for out the heart comes evil intentions murder adultery illicit sex theft false witness slander these are what defile a man but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man

3151130 the divestiture provisions of house bill 1516 conflict with article 36 a part i of the new hampshire constitution because it would require the board to make investment decisions for the purpose other than providing benefits to members and beneficiaries and divest assets in order to further the foreign policy objectives of the new hampshire legislature
3151131 shall not be encumbered for or diverted to any other purposes
3151132 my concern is that the legislature is stepping into the shoes of the trustees without the attendant fiduciary duties of the trustees
3151133 you dont want the legislature on a whim to do these kinds of things without a benchmark for how serious the thing is
3151134 but in real life theres acting and theres not acting we have real dollars blood money more or less going to the benefit of the public employees of the state
3151135 the ongoing atrocities in the darfur region of the sudan are disturbing and warrant the restrictions on sudan linked investments i encourage the state and the judicial retirement systems to make responsible efforts to comply with new hampshires divestment law i believe strongly it is the right thing and the moral thing to do and can be done without compromising the sound investment strategies adopted by the boards
3151136 i cant imagine the sudan investments are so far superior to anything else out there in the marketplace just like i cant imagine theyd invest in illegal drug sales which obviously would turn a huge profit
3151137 theres no law in the new hampshire constitution or new hampshire code that says you cannot replace poorly performing investments with financially superior alternatives that are not tied up in one of the worst human rights abuses of our time
3151138 well he asked me what i wanted and i said yellow flowers
3151139 ok he is either stupid or lying if he doesnt know what red roses mean
3151140 hes lying hes been trying to send me flowers for two weeks and i relented because it was my birthday but theyre not yellow
3151141 i hate when men do that ask you what you want and then give you something not quite it it means i dont value your opinion and i am going to make your mind up for you dont get me wrong they are beautiful flowers and id kill or die for them but they are not what you told him to get you id have to say something
3151142 when i flipped at the 50 and saw how far ahead he was knowing he was the world record holder for a split second a thought crossed my mind there is no way
3151143 but i said you know what this is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts honestly in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got like a super charge and just took it from there it was unreal
3151144 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
3151145 ive never celebrated that much after a race in my life
3151146 its hard to put that kind of race behind you but it sets me up for something good tomorrow
3151147 this morning bob bowman had said the french were saying some stuff talking a little bit of trash
3151148 it fired me up more than anything else i told garret and he said you know what were going to let our swimming do the talking

3151158 i know deans not here bobby it is bobby isnt it
3151159 yup very careless of you bobby no salt now i would just love to kill you but sam made sure i couldnt but that does not mean i cant share a little information and since you where so sweet as to offer to help me i just feel i have to tell you what happened to your dear boys
3151160 so what happened since your in a caring sharing mood
3151161 that wont be necessary neither will tying me to a chair fun but not necessary
3151162 you see bobby our little sammy had the way out of the deal all figured out months ago and last night he put it into action at this very moment dean is held captive by a vampire nest and it was sam who handed him over it was all part of the deal he saved deans soul we cant get it but it cost him his own he sold out to a vampire and our dear dean is a slave poor boy chained in a cage with no hope left
3151163 bobby i dont need to remind you that we only lie when it hurts more then the truth but on this occasion the truth well that hurts doesnt it i really hope you find them in time though i think it would be much more fun for all of us if you didnt

3151177 well see how it goes its the first day havent really seen anything yet
3151178 a little inconvenient a little bit how much longer do you think it will take you to get to work oh gosh maybe an extra 10 15 minutes out of my way
3151179 i think its needed if you gotta do it you gotta do it
3151180 usually it starts picking up around 7 30 a m and hits is peak between 8 00 and 8 30 a m

3151182 its a little inconvenient a little bit how much longer its maybe an extra 10 or 15 minutes out of my way
3151183 it will affect me a little bit but i think its going to be alright well see how it goes its the first day havent really seen anything yet
3151184 for all of the rich complexity that describes the profound integration of man and mountain into one the burden of the recycled wastewater can only be expressed by the plaintiffs as damaged spiritual feelings
3151185 under supreme court precedent government action that diminishes subjective spiritual fulfillment does not substantially burden religion
3151186 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
3151187 the navajo people are trying to do everything we can to save self and the peaks is one of our strengths
3151188 when you contaminate it with reclaimed wastewater with filth to make snow that doesnt help native peoples way of life
3151189 we are very excited the court ruled in favor for snowbowl and the multiple use of public land
3151190 united states government took this land from the indians by force
3151191 the majority now uses that forcible deprivation as a justification for spraying treated sewage effluent on the holiest of the indians holy mountains and for refusing to recognize that this action constitutes a substantial burden on the indians
3151192 later that day i got to thinking about relationships there are those that open you up to something new and exotic those that are old and familiar those that bring up lots of questions those that bring you somewhere unexpected those that bring you far from where you started and those that bring you back but the most exciting challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself and if you can find someone to love the you you love well thats just fabulous
3151193 when it comes to relationships maybe were all in glass houses and shouldnt throw stones because you can never really know some people are settling down some are settling and some people refuse to settle for anything less than butterflies

3151202 they are people and not robots they are my children and not a burden
3151203 this course made me see the reason why i ended the relationship with my girlfriend

3151214 we feel brocades fundamentals are strong at this time emc qlogic ibm lsi and hds all reported strong results and we expect netapp to beat revenue and eps for july quarter
3151215 all of our checks direct and indirect channels point to a july revenue strength across both products and services this should support revenue at the high end or above the range 845 875
3151216 we believe the high end of the 20 to 23 cent earnings range is achievable
3151217 cisco lost share to brocade in the july quarter in our opinion
3151218 we expect brocade san products to be up double digits year over year in the july quarter
3151219 we believe that brocades san growth is partly because of ciscos lack of 8 gig blades
3151220 and possibly because emc is favoring brocade over cisco at this time note that brocade had started selling 8 gig products in the first calendar quarter
3151221 the high end of the storage market was stronger than normal through the july quarter in large part due to the mainframe cycle as confirmed by commentary from sun emc ibm and hp
3151222 at the same time ciscos storage switch business was off 14 percent year over year
3151223 although the foundry acquisition bid adds complexity to what was otherwise a clean buy thesis near term the strong july performance should provide some relief
3151224 we maintain our buy rating and 9 price target on brocade shares
3151225 australians dont have much respect for the music press it runs counter to their culture australian rock is all about good on ya mate well done for getting up on stage and switching that amplifier on
3151226 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy everyone is treated equally which means no knocking anyone back however great the temptation thatll be why australian rock is best known to the outside world for such musical abominations as silverchair the vines and savage garden
3151227 se est dando seguimiento muy puntual y cercano a estos avances principalmente en materia de procedimientos judiciales y de orden estructural es un tema que no vamos a soltar porque nos parece vital que se d cumplimiento a todas las recomendaciones

3151233 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3151234 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3151235 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3151236 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3151237 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3151238 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3151239 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3151240 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3151241 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3151242 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3151243 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3151244 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3151245 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
3151246 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
3151247 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3151248 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
3151249 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies

3151259 planes rockets cluster and phosphorus bombs for israel to use at will
3151260 many non militant arabs and muslims await some degree of fairness from you if you are elected
3151261 cannot comprehend how many jewish people can speak of the holocaust as well as stating that israel is the holy land and commit the atrocities they are committing against the palestinian people
3151262 shed ourselves from the racist zionists in america they control everything but they wont keep us down any longer throw the jews in the oven this november its the only way we can free america and make sure barack obama is elected
3151263 israel has destroyed its own image in the world and is taking america down with its zionist aggression
3151264 please re think posting material like this we are not interested in an anti israel policy
3151265 the last thing we need is to be aligned with more anti semitic rhetoric jewish conspiracy speculation should be left to the experts at the united nations
3151266 entire congress should be overthrown by revolution for having sold america to the israelis
3151267 content on blogs in my barackobama represents the opinions of community members and in no way should be interpreted as endorsed or approved by the campaign
3151268 i think whats going to happen eventually is ultimately were going to lose a lot of people to imports some people have to lease cars no matter how you look at it
3151269 what were trying to do right now is convert people to financing trying to sell them on the advantages of owning their own cars
3151270 chrysler is offering almost 6 000 in rebates to customers before they even talk to a salesperson
3151271 this is a very aggressive program that combined with low interest rates should counteract any effect not having a lease option would have
3151272 with gas prices being so high we see a lot more customers hanging on to their vehicle especially if it is fuel efficient
3151273 thats probably where chrysler will see a dip in sales
3151274 the letter said that i wouldnt see much of a change if i wanted to purchase a new jeep when my lease is up
3151275 i just dont see how this is true because a person typically puts something like 3 000 down for a lease and if you change that to a down payment on a 30 000 new vehicle purchase your monthly payments would be over 2 000
3151276 i have enjoyed leasing a jeep and if they continued the program i would not have had a second thought about leasing another jeep
3151277 but with this change in policy and the current cost of gas i am going to have to take a look at changing my strategy in choosing a vehicle

3151279 crypto jews the flame that the inquisition could not extinguish
3151280 growing numbers of bnai anousim throughout the spanish and portuguese speaking world are looking to reconnect with israel and the jewish people
3151281 one of our goals is to raise awareness among world jewry about this phenomenon by telling the story of the bnai anousim both in the past and the present
3151282 for far too long the jewish people have ignored the bnai anousim and it is time for that to change we need to reach out to them and to welcome them back home
3151283 a person should not speak in the presence of someone greater than him in wisdom

3151313 si a treia parte din ape s a facut ca pelinul
3151314 de aceste trei plagi de focul si de fumul si de pucioasa care iese din gura lor a fost ucisa a treia parte din oameni
3151315 incat nimeni sa nu poata cumpara sau vinde decat numai cel ce are semnul adica numele fiarei
3151316 si o buba rea si ucigatoare s a ivit pe oamenii care aveau semnul fiarei si care se inchinau chipului fiarei

3151330 this kind of thing is ludicrous that such errors could be permitted to occur and not have controls in place to prevent them occurring
3151331 while we dont want to go off the deep end about a single error the fact is corporations arent being careful enough with consumer data and are not being held to account
3151332 where there is a real risk of serious harm occurring as a result

3151337 married people are still healthier than unmarried people but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
3151338 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those social groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
3151339 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
3151340 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
3151341 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses
3151342 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last 3 to 6 years that has had an impact on the market
3151343 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3151344 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3151345 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so
3151346 it appears the banks debt will not be paid from the sale of the assets said mr donnelly who acts for the administrator
3151347 the banks will suffer a substantial deficiency and therefore theres no chance of creditors getting a dividend hence shareholders will not have any likelihood of a return
3151348 with summerslam only 8 days away and the summer olympics that started last night nothing kept the action on friday night smackdown from sizzling
3151349 last night members of the family were laid out one by one with mysterious black roses laid upon their helpless bodies first it was bam neely in the loading area then curt hawkins in the locker room being concerned as to who is responsible for it chavo made vickie guererro believe that they needed edges help the rated r superstar made chavo and vickie believe that it was the undertaker so chavo edge and vickie went to the ring believing that it was the undertaker but instead it was edge as he nailed chavo from behind with a chair tossing his wife out of her wheelchair leaving her in tears edge told vickie mick foley was right this is the edge that needs to step in hell in a cell when vickie gave edge the news about facing the undertaker at summerslam in a hell in a cell match it looked to me that edge started to snap i think that it all finally came out last week when mick foley gave him a talking to i think edge is mentally prepared for the match at summerslam
3151350 in great wrestling action it was a 6 diva olympic style tag team match a very unique encounter as maryse victoria and natayla were up against cherry maria and the wwe divas champion michelle mccool the closing moments of the match included a ddt by cherry onto natalya the widows peak by victoria onto cherry and michelle mccool with a boot to the face of victoria but in the end it was natalya applying the sharpshooter on maria making her submit and getting the win for her team this match did have the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat
3151351 then in tag team action the wwe tag team champions zack ryder and curt hawkins before he was mysteriously knockered out faced jimmy wang yang and the now released shannon moore towards the end of the match the referee was distracted therefore hawkins and ryder took advantage and nailed moore with a double ddt and it was ryder getting the pinfall for his team now that hawkins and ryder are the wwe tag team champions they sure learned a lot from being edges goony birds from what i understand they are the youngest tag team champions in wwe history
3151352 in one of the best hard fought matches ive seen so far on smackdown this year the united states champion shelton benjamin took on jeff hardy throughout the match benjamins main target was hardys left leg that he injured while facing edge on saturday nights main event things were going in hardys favor however as he nailed benjamin with a twist of fate with a swanton bomb to follow the match was ruled a no contest as mvp rushed in the ring just like he did on saturday nights main event and kicked hardy square in the head mvp and jeff hardy will face each other at summerslam as announced on wwe com earlier this week i think that at summerslam we may see a side of jeff hardy that no one has seen before
3151353 then it was the indian broken glass competition as the wwe champion triple h was taking on the man that he will defend the wwe championship against at summerslam in the great khali just when it looked like triple h was going to win khali nailed the game with a headbutt followed by his crushing vise grip even though this was ruled a no contest the game has vowed to break both of khalis legs at summerslam its going to take a lot more than broken legs to get past a man the size of the great khali
3151354 then vladmir kozlov put his undefeated streak on the line against jesse the moscow mauler demanded better competition before the match got started but jesse didnt deliver as he went off the top rope into a crushing headbutt from kozlov giving the moscow mauler yet another win this man cannot be stopped
3151355 then super crazy in his first match on smackdown took on the brian kendrick with his bodyguard ezekial jackson in his corner super crazy gave it his all against kendrick but thanks to distraction from ezekial kendrick ended up winning the match however it wasnt enough as kendricks bodyguard gave his opponent a crushing backbreaker

3151402 work for social reasons but not like they really need to
3151403 arent you afraid of getting caught is it worth it
3151404 fannie often displays the wisdom of a hard life lived
3151405 i approached her as we both waited for an elevator
3151406 i told her that i wished i had kept a record of her truisms through the many many years ive observed her at city hall she simply smiled
3151407 fannie told the standard lineup of suits at the table when millions of dollars were being discussed for the wolstein flats project
3151408 a hammer hurts whether it hits you in the hand or the head
3151409 the context was about the power and damage of eminent domain
3151410 gave lewis a look of condescension asking her if she had finished in such a manner that the question took the tone of a put down
3151411 you and i came into this council screaming about the same things corporate rip offs of public money
3151412 this ties up the city like you tie up a hog
3151413 their purpose is to depose the democratically elected government of georgia
3151414 we are right now driving through the town and i see no trace of troops or military vehicles it is absolutely deserted
3151415 russian forces have destroyed senaki military base and have left it
3151416 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia and the further loss of life
3151417 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
3151418 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3151419 and because it winds itself up to the forest canopy and spreads it can cover as much canopy area as a community of trees
3151420 it appears to be true that lianas grow more rapidly at higher levels of c02
3151421 but there could be other explanations for the increase in lianas too weather could be a factor
3151422 if lianas can grow far more than trees during seasonal droughts then global increases in drought from such events as el ni o or la ni a may be responsible for the documented increases in liana abundance
3151423 if you cant figure out whats going on in the ecological system then look at the oddball the deviant something that doesnt fit the model
3151424 the requirement to align the assets on our balance sheet with our market capitalization resulted in the company taking this action
3151425 but the non cash charges have no impact on the future prospects of the company our strategic focus remains unchanged scripps is healthy with low debt and well able to make the necessary decisions and investments to solidify our local media businesses as the premier information and advertising resources in their markets
3151426 all of those things we kind of knew by heart at the rca dome
3151427 well have enough time on the field in two preseason games but sometimes those can be the biggest headaches wheres my wifes elevator hopefully we can get a lot of that ironed out
3151428 i would say this i think panthers head coach john fox was the same as me in that we were playing to avoid overtime
3151429 we were trying to win the game in regulation then when you get into overtime youre trying to win it as fast as you can both of us probably made some decisions you wouldnt normally make in a regular season game
3151430 it is what it is i thought our guys played hard both sides wanted to win and you cant tell the guys who are out there dont try to win the game i was fine with it
3151431 we had a few guys play more than we planned but that goes with the territory
3151432 i feel good im hoping theyre looking and noticing i can contribute to the team i feel like ive done well obviously i have a lot to work on but i feel like im making some progress camp has been a great experience this year last year it was so hard i didnt know what was going on this year that aspect of it isnt so hard
3151433 those guys reserve quarterbacks jared lorenzen and quinn gray in the first two games have made plays getting out of the pocket and have made long runs when people are playing man coverage against you thats one of the downsides of it since ive been here not many of our guys have been that way it gives you an extra threat you have to defend
3151434 the disappointing thing was our first group didnt really make that improvement we were looking for
3151435 its something weve emphasized and for the second week in a row i thought we did a good job kicking and covering
3151436 adam and hunter have taken it upon themselves to make sure were getting good kicks to cover
3151437 our guys are running hard and weve done a good job with those units
3151438 we didnt play as good a second game as we did a first game but i think were coming along ok
3151439 i think our big goal is to be a little bit sharper and to play better in the game with our first group
3151440 theyll go a little bit longer on saturday against atlanta they know that and they want to play a little bit better i think they were disappointed coming off that kind of uneven performance against carolina
3151441 on the third play of the game he was going to have a touchdown if we protect it he got behind his guy he caught the balls that came to him and didnt have any physical problems i think he was pleased with it and we were also
3151442 we are pleased to provide this inaugural earnings release as an independent public company we have accomplished a lot in a short period of time all while continuing to deliver strong results over the past year we have devoted significant resources to the successful separation from our parent company we have established a top notch board of directors initiated sound corporate governance practices and filled several key senior executive positions we believe we are well positioned to capture future growth opportunities and create value for our shareholders
3151443 the research proves for the first time that if you eliminate the garbage the cells will keep functioning well and are pretty much the same as they were when they were young
3151444 the second quarter represented a clear example of why our diverse business model provides a natural hedge to changes in our operating environment during the quarter our service businesses continued to over perform despite an absence of planned revenue from the collection of our owned portfolios and some volume fluctuations amongst our crm clients the reduced collections in our pm business negatively impacted our earnings and caused us to incur additional impairment on several older portfolios however it is important to note that these charges were partially offset by meaningful reductions during the quarter in nonrecourse interest expense and the minority interest of our nonrecourse lender as we enter the back half of the year we are focused on maintaining stability in our service business and positioning ourselves for increased opportunities as our client base readjusts to the ongoing changes in consumer payment patterns additionally our pm business continues to refine its underwriting criteria with a focus toward purchasing portfolios that are likely to perform well as ongoing changes to the consumer continue to unfold
3151445 we are pleased to have exceeded our revenue estimate for our second quarter
3151446 it is important to note that during the second quarter our nutracea segment operated at 30 capacity overall due to difficulties in obtaining adequate quantities of rice bran our mermentau plant was not operational from may through july because the rice mill that serves that facility was not milling rice additionally our lake charles facility production levels have not been reached because the rice mill was phasing in our contract for rice bran beginning this month we anticipate that both of these mills will be operational and our plants will be receiving 100 of the output from each mill
3151447 we feel that we are making great strides at our company most importantly the value of our business model to establish facilities in major rice producing countries is being validated by the early success of irgovel we are moving ahead with our china facility and it will be over seven times the size of our existing facility in brazil this project will incorporate state of the art technology and because of scale is anticipated to generate results that are more than seven times greater than what we are currently achieving in brazil this project is progressing and we hope to obtain all the necessary permits and approvals shortly and break ground later this year we anticipate that revenues for the third quarter will increase modestly over those for the second quarter of this year with a more significant increase in the fourth quarter as we begin to move our inventory to new and existing customers
3151448 in my view our poor performance is not the result of poor economic conditions much of our operating shortfall i believe is the result of our own lack of execution as a company that began in the midst of the great depression we have a deep heritage from one of the great american brands and are fortunate to have attracted committed and passionate employees benefits that we believe will allow us once again to become a thriving chain
3151449 jeg skal ha nytt lodd jeg vant jeg ska ha to nye lodd

3151474 our production challenges are something which we are addressing as part of our turnaround efforts we are putting the appropriate expertise in place via consulting arrangements new hires and reorganization of personnel our first forays into a remediation campaign are encouraging however it will be a slow march as we work to get back on track this process may take in excess of 12 months to solve our challenges in their entirety
3151475 it is disappointing that we have not yet been able to successfully refinance the companys debt we are not alone however in these difficult credit markets as we are familiar with firms much larger than aurora which have also experienced challenges in refinancing efforts in the meantime we continue to have open dialogue with our lending partners while working to methodically address our various operational and financial concerns in the meantime our developed and undeveloped assets continue to provide cash flow and future opportunity for the company
3151476 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

3151900 we have achieved considerable measurable progress over the past year to transform the company from one serving disparate industries to one focused on the security industry we noted at the beginning of fy2008 that our key objectives for the year would include strengthening our management team streamlining operations expanding our product line and enhancing distribution efforts we have made noteworthy progress in all areas while we recognize there is still considerable work to be done we believe our corporate reinvention is substantially underway and beginning to show tangible results
3151901 as we orchestrate a wholesale corporate reinvention from a company addressing diverse markets to a high tech company focused on the urgent needs of the homeland security and related markets we felt it was important to bring more relevant security experience on board
3151902 we now have a very talented industry savvy management team we believe our recent sales successes exemplify this and our year over year sales growth demonstrates greater market credibility while sales volumes are expected to fluctuate our growth should continue as we roll out innovative product solutions to address the security needs of our growing customer base
3151903 in late fy2007 we announced our intention to embark upon a plan to exit from our medical and semiconductor businesses since then we successfully concluded the sale of two segments of our medical business a third sale is scheduled to be concluded in the first quarter of fy2009 and we have an informal agreement to sell the remaining medical assets in the second quarter of fy2009 at the same time we have entered into a formal process to sell our semiconductor business we previously announced our goal to be completely divested of our medical and semiconductor businesses by the end of calendar 2008 and at this point we believe we are on track to meet that goal
3151904 we are pleased to report we have more than doubled the number of units of our quantum sniffer products sold year over year
3151905 our technical capabilities should allow us to participate in six key detection areas of the future handheld benchtop package scanners air cargo inspection people in motion and vehicle checkpoints this past fiscal year we have significantly expanded our servable geographies introduced a key new product and made considerable progress on our product roadmap as a result we believe the company is well positioned for continued growth
3151906 there are still challenges ahead of us and we have much to do in order for the company to be successful
3151907 specifically in fy2009 we will continue efforts to expand our security product line improve government reporting performance strengthen our cash position restructure reduce debt complete the divestiture of our medical and semiconductor businesses and continue to leverage relationships and distribution channels to expand customer reach all with the goal of continuing our year over year growth trend we have a clear path ahead and in our judgment the company is doing the right things to achieve sustainable profitability and long term success of course there are many factors that could impact future results but with the team we have and the various technological assets we have in place and under development we are confident in our ability to grow the company and handle future challenges

3151921 it is impossible to simultaneously prevent and plan for war
3151922 there have been numerous predictions that martial law is going to be declared and citizens rounded up by foreign un troops and held prisoner in secret fema detention camps but so far that hasnt happened whats the real story rex
3151923 in april 1984 president ronald reagan signed presidential directorate number 54 that allowed fema to engage in a secret national readiness exercise under the code name of rex 84 i was part of that back then but thats not why i use the codename rex 84 see
3151924 all right well buy that for now just to get on with things
3151925 okay then the exercise that isnt my codename was to test femas readiness to assume military authority in the event of a state of domestic national emergency concurrent with the launching of a direct united states military operation in central america
3151926 did that ever happen that was over 20 years ago
3151927 no that never happened the central america thing but it could have it still could the plan calls for the deputation of us military and national guard units so that they can legally be used for domestic law enforcement these units will be assigned to conduct sweeps and take into custody an estimated 400 000 undocumented central american immigrants in the united states these immigrants will be interned at 10 detention centers to be set up at military bases throughout the country
3151928 ten detention centers what about the 800 secret fema detention camps that are secretly all over the place
3151929 theres more now this was the original plan very small time
3151930 you say regular army troops and national guard troops may be used to round up americans what about all the secret foreign un troops secretly in the us and on a war footing since 1992
3151931 i dont think im familiar with that facet of the plan
3151932 really because there are supposed to be like russian spetsnaz and gurkhas chinese and nicaraguan troops secretly in the us at secret bases and underground bases and everything and theyre going to round us up because american military troops might hesitate to fire on american citizens
3151933 have you heard of the battle hardened east jesus militia
3151934 uh uh look rex 84 was so highly guarded that special metal security doors were placed on the fifth floor of the fema building in washington even long standing employees of the civil defense of the federal executive department possessing the highest possible security clearances were not being allowed through the newly installed metal security doors
3151935 could you get through these special heavy metal security doors
3151936 yes i could only personnel wearing a special red christian cross or crucifix lapel pin were allowed into the premises and i had both of those things so i could get in
3151937 but you never heard of the battle hardened east jesus militia being secretly in the us at a secret base possibly underground
3151938 no but i found out that the plan called for the suspension of the constitution turning control of the government over to fema appointment of military commanders to run state and local governments and the declaration of martial law presidential executive orders to support such a plan were already in place
3151939 but if presidential executive orders were already in place to support suspending the constitution and declaring martial law and rounding everybody up why did george bush need to sign pdd 51 in the first place
3151940 was that not discussed behind the heavy metal security doors
3151941 no it wasnt we discussed things like fema standing by to take over the government and stuff fema stood by in 1990 when desert storm got underway prior to president bushs invasion of iraq fema began to draft new legislation to increase its already formidable powers one of the elements incorporated into the plan was to set up operations within any state or locality without the prior permission of local or state authorities such prior permission has always been required in the past much of the mechanism being set into place was in anticipation of the economic collapse of the western world the war with iraq may have been conceived as a ploy to boost the bankrupt economy but it only pushed the west into deeper recession
3151942 that certainly tends to confirm the latest alarm and predictions that the economy will collapse on september 15th or thereabouts and that the us government will collapse in february 2009
3151943 right fema will be ready to step in they were ready during the los angeles riots after the rodney king verdict had the rioting spread to other cities fema would have been empowered to step in as it was major rioting only occurred in the los angeles area thus preventing a pretext for a fema response
3151944 how many cities did it have to spread to before fema would actually you know carry out this bastardly plot
3151945 is that why they didnt take over the country when hurricane katrina hit new orleans
3151946 thats correct if katrina had hit other cities fema would have stepped in
3151947 im telling you fema has a folder with 22 executive orders for the president to sign in case of an emergency its believed those executive orders contain the framework of all the takeover concepts
3151948 but if presidential executive orders and pdd 51 are already in place why the fuck do they need 22 secret folders full of more shit
3151949 we keep hearing that yes but that was seven years ago it hasnt happened in the last seven years or for the last 20 years for crying out loud all those secret foreign troops have been here since 1992 and theyre on a war footing thats like 27 years that nothings happened
3151950 its going to they were going to declare a national emergency during the war on drugs and turn the us into a police state
3151951 actually no but it could have it still can the first targets in any fema emergency will be rounded up and detained tax protesters demonstrators against government military intervention outside us borders and people who maintain weapons in their homes are also targets
3151952 well then youre a target probably on the red list youll be targeted by operation trojan horse
3151953 what the hell is that it sounds like an oversized condom
3151954 its not a joke but itll be a powerful fucking operation trojan horse is a program designed to learn the identity of potential opponents to martial law the program lures potential protesters into public forums conducted by a hero of the people who advocates survival training the list of names gathered at such meetings and rallies are computerized and then targeted in case of an emergency
3151955 holy shit is right the constitution itself can now be suspended the scenarios established to trigger fema into action are generally found in the society today economic collapse civil unrest drug problems terrorist attacks and protests against american intervention in a foreign country all these premises exist so its only be a matter of time before one of these triggers the entire emergency necessary to bring fema into action
3151956 hasnt a lot of that happened already though drug problems terrorist attack protests how come fema hasnt declared martial law yet this stuff has been going on for over 20 years seriously what the fuck are they waiting for
3151957 the right trigger there are now over 600 prison camps in the united states all fully operational and ready to receive prisoners they are all staffed and even surrounded by full time guards but they are all empty
3151958 the last report we had was 800 secret fema detention camps and almost 1000 halliburton prison camps are these the same thing or are there actually 1800 prison camps fully staffed and guarded 24 hours a day even though theres nobody in a god damned one of them
3151959 somewhere in between there probably to tell the truth theres so many camps now that its sometimes hard to keep track of them hell weve had personnel that completed 20 years of government service guarding an empty camp retired without seeing a single prisoner and the government didnt even know they were on the payroll until they retired
3151960 how are illegally seized and detained citizens going to be transported to these 1800 fema and halliburton secret prison camps
3151961 the camps all have railroad facilities as well as roads leading to and from the detention facilities many also have an airport nearby the majority of the camps can house a population of 20 000 prisoners currently the largest of these facilities is just outside of fairbanks alaska the alaskan facility is a massive mental health facility and can hold approximately 2 million nuts another camp is in palmdale california its not operating as a prison at the moment but is masquerading as a water facility still another camp is masquerading as a sewage treatment plant man thats a good one no one would suspect a sewage treatment plant to be a secret fema detention facility fences run for miles around this facility and they all point inward and there are large mounds of dirt and a dry moat surrounding the central area so the inside area is not visible from the road there are 3 huge loading docks facing the entrance that can be observed from the road there are white vans patrolling the area
3151962 are these white vans anything like unmarked black suvs probably armored
3151963 no theyre white vans one came out and greeted us with a friendly wave and followed us until we had driven safely beyond the area but you know what would have happened had we decided to enter the open gate or ask questions uh huh curtains its curtains for anyone who asks questions about this stuff there is a railroad track that runs next to the perimeter of this fenced area the loading docks are large enough to hold railroad cars
3151964 large enough to hold those 3 tiered prisoner boxcars painted white with un markings
3151965 oh yeah it can hold scores of prisoner boxcars just at the disguised shit plant there is an area that contains about 100 black railroad cars loads of railroad cars have been manufactured in oregon outfitted with shackles
3151966 but theyre black you say arent they supposed to be white with un markings
3151967 maybe the black ones have the satanic altars in them
3151968 im not sure about the altars but regardless what will bring about a situation that will call into effect the need for these new prison facilities is a man made natural catastrophe like an earthquake caused by haarp or a massive hurricane crashing into the country and flooding it or fear of such dimensions as to cause nationwide panic
3151969 like the kind of panic we might see if everyone was suddenly told that a mysterious asteroid was going to crash into the earth
3151970 exactly that would be a disaster and once a major disaster occurs whether its a real event or manufactured martial law is hurriedly put in place and we are all in the hands of the government agencies meaning fema who thus portray themselves as our protectors yet what happens when we question those in authority and how they are taking away all of our freedoms will we be the ones detained in these camp sites and who are they going to round up those with guns those who ask questions those that want to know whats really going on does that include any of us when first coming across this information i was in a state of total denial i thought it was bullshit
3151971 well its true several instances have recently been reported where those that were asking questions that came too near the untold truth were removed from the press conferences and from the public eye also those that wanted to speak to the press were detained and either imprisoned locked in a psychiatric hospital murdered and then otherwise discredited
3151972 wow youd think just murdering someone would sufficiently discredit them
3151973 after a quiet weekend the nationals made the most noise today signing three of their top choices for bonuses that exceed mlbs recommendations long beach state shortstop danny espinosa third round got 525 000 florida high school pitcher graham hicks fourth received 475 000 and florida prep catcher adrian nieto turned pro for 376 000
3151974 and who brings the apples to us when they are ripe who drives them to us and sells them
3151975 like the entire food sector were seeing sharply escalating energy transportation and ingredient costs
3151976 what do you think should be a dominant issue of the 2008 campaign

3151996 volgens onze informatie vechten zon 3 000 huurlingen die door amerikaanse militaire deskundigen worden geleid aan georgische zijde mee tegen russische vredessoldaten
3151997 meteen is ook duidelijk waarom georgi nooit is ingegaan op het russische voorstel een wettelijk bindend document te ondertekenen dat voor het oplossen van de kwestie zuid osseti geen geweld mag worden gebruikt

3152005 he was already talking about making the olympics when he got here
3152006 we could tell he had a lot of talent and that he had the drive to do it
3152007 jumping up and down screaming and crying at the same time
3152008 for people to see someone of color who can stand out in a nontraditional area in a role that is positive is tremendous
3152009 as people here in ottawa join with others from across the country to pray and fast and take courageous action for 40 days to end the tragic violence of abortion we look forward to seeing what kind of transformation god will bring about in our city and throughout canada
3152010 40 days for life has already generated proven lifesaving results in cities across america
3152011 during the fall of 2007 and spring of 2008 dozens of communities joined together for nationally coordinated 40 days for life campaigns the efforts of thousands of people of faith helped make a tremendous difference
3152012 numerous cities reported a significant drop in abortions some abortion facilities either closed altogether or scaled back their operations during the campaign new volunteers got active in local pro life efforts churches of different denominations worked together to work for an end to abortion in their cities many post abortive women begin programs to heal from the pain caused by previous abortion experiences with such a strong track record of results we are excited to see what god has in store for this fall
3152013 we are expecting great things for our local 40 days for life campaign
3152014 it is exciting for our city to be a part of something that can have such lifesaving impact and we cant wait to begin

3152016 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3152017 anything you can do to change and modernize the convention is positive one of the biggest challenges is putting up something television will cover and people will want to watch

3152026 a man who has reached the end of his rope and has accessorized his downward spiral with multiple alcoholic drinks not finding a solution at the bottom of the bottle our main character turns to the u s army in the hopes that fighting for freedom will uplift him from his current situation but it becomes apparent that our friend has once again chosen a solution for the wrong reasons and in one last futile attempt asks to whomever is listening upstairs to help him or answer the question if he is just to be one of the millions of people who just suffer its only at the end of the song that we realize that to change the mediocrity of our lives or to rid ourselves of our past demons that we must be the force of change in our lives nobody can do it for you only you can pull yourself out of the deep dark hole only you can stop crucifying yourself and help yourself only you can stop yourself from being the martyr and instead be the fire starter that lights that candle in you and everybody in your life

3152066 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3152067 there is evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia

3152099 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3152100 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3152101 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3152102 mr wallace will be working with the council to identify what can be done to improve the situation
3152103 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3152104 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3152105 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
3152106 more troubling the devices failed to detect the presence of wireless microphones when switched on an occurrence that takes place multiple times during any nfl game
3152107 theres no question that the geolocation technology that was tested is reliable
3152108 but on the sensing side it didnt always detect usable and unusable channels in different areas these results reflected what we saw in the lab under certain conditions
3152109 taken together these protection mechanisms remain technically unimpeachable whether or not the commissions current testing process produces adequate data to validate a spectrum sensing only approach
3152110 moreover no wsd white space device will or should come to market unless the fcc can verify that the device does not interfere with tv or wireless microphone signals
3152111 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3152112 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3152113 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3152120 substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3152121 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tiblisi
3152122 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3152123 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3152124 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a government elected by its people
3152125 an immediate cease fire the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict a return to the military status quo as of aug 6 and a commitment to refrain from the use of force
3152126 russias government must reverse the course that it appears to be on as a first step toward resolving this conflict

3152129 although may wetland conditions on the prairies were down most waterfowl populations held steady
3152130 however early summer rains have improved nesting conditions considerably we expect to have good reproduction in the parklands
3152131 immunizations are the first line of defense in protecting children from very serious and potentially deadly illnesses
3152132 nationally we are beginning to see a resurgence of preventable diseases that had all but been eradicated simply due to a lack of inoculation i urge all parents to keep their childrens vaccinations up to date to avoid unnecessary pain and suffering of our most precious citizens
3152133 until recently we could confidently tell parents that nearly every child would have one or more bouts of rotavirus diarrhea before they turned five
3152134 this years rotavirus season resulted in fewer than half the cases of any season in the last 15 years its amazing to witness the dramatic drop in illness in such a short time after we started using the vaccine
3152135 what worries me is that some of these parents are avoiding vaccines because of frightening and inaccurate information they encounter on television and online with all the unverified information out there parents need help finding resources they can rely on
3152136 the first person to turn to is your pediatrician he or she has access to the latest information and knows you and your child best there also are excellent governmental and non governmental web sites available for parents
3152137 russia must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step in resolving this conflict
3152138 there are no discussions about the u s getting involved militarily
3152139 the message to my parents was he can stop they passed the message on to me
3152140 every time i did something which would be 200 times a day when i would jerk my arm or a fast eye blink or whatever there was a message you cant stop after a while of that the pain is pretty excruciating
3152141 but in high school no one ever talked about college to me high school counselors for the most part dont know who you are dont think you can do it
3152142 there are so many people who have lived here for 20 years and are not citizens
3152143 theyre in the middle not from here and not from there a lot of them dont go to college because of the cost
3152144 the work they mifn do is important because they help people become more educated about the immigration issues and what its like to be an immigrant
3152145 they help get our voices out there we may not have a vote but we have a voice
3152146 everybodys eating salsa not only eating it but dancing it immigrants have revived lake street we make sure everythings running we cook in the kitchens and clean and work in the yards
3152147 we dont want people to get caught up in the myopic conversation about how we are a nation of laws those are harmful ideologies that are not about bringing people together
3152148 one of the primary reasons people want to immigrate here is that we are a nation of laws
3152149 unlike many areas of the world our legal systems have a high degree of integrity we cannot maintain a generous legal immigration system by excusing widespread illegal immigration
3152150 we do talk about immigration but i really think its more about the organization reaching out to youth and getting people engaged in their communities
3152151 the activities are all about trying to get students to talk about issues at the school and in their lives what their dreams were
3152152 this kind of work is not just some altruistic thing it makes their the students own lives richer
3152153 it takes away fear a lot of my students were afraid to go to lake street opens doors expands their world vision radically changes their lives
3152154 you want to get them to understand that the immigration story relates to all of us but mostly you tell them whatever you have to share share
3152155 i describe states of mind and my dynamic involves creating tension building it and then releasing its like a rubber band i try to stretch it as much as i can
3152156 when i first met elisa i was very impressed to find a true and real artist in the noise and fast pace of todays culture we need real artists who are able to express things we dont even have time to talk about
3152157 the important thing for me is to get out and play
3152158 mobile living up to its potential is the next big thing and the iphone is really delivering on that promise
3152159 the lessons that we learn from these tragic incidents serve the fire service best if they are used as the basis of preventing future deaths
3152160 he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
3152161 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
3152162 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic
3152163 one of them is original and the rest of them are covers
3152164 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
3152165 who cares what it costs i have too much money
3152166 the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3152167 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting
3152168 people have always been fascinated by how some trees such as douglas fir or redwoods can grow so tall
3152169 this is not an easy thing to do think about trying to drink water through a narrow 350 foot long straw it takes a lot of suction
3152170 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3152171 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3152172 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3152173 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them

3152179 it means that well likely see vegetation shift a lot faster than we might think
3152180 the plant death was striking and occurred in most species
3152181 the occurrence of plant death was obvious to everyone living in that area
3152182 drought certainly stands out as a real likely explanation it is an extremely severe event

3152191 lord you said that once i decided to follow you youd walk with me all the way but i have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life there is only one set of footprints i dont understand why when i needed you most you would leave me
3152192 my son my precious child i love you and i would never leave you during your times of trial and suffering when you see only one set of footprints it was then that i carried you
3152193 do not be terrified by them for the lord your god who is among you is a great and awesome god
3152194 lord you said that once i decided to follow you youd walk with me all the way but i have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life there is only one set of footprints i dont understand why when i needed you most you would leave me
3152195 my son my precious child i love you and i would never leave you during your times of trial and suffering when you see only one set of footprints it was then that i carried you

3152198 i believe we all owe a moral obligation to these researchers and institutions to protect them from any unjustified embarrassment or damage to their reputations which revelations of their identities might bring
3152199 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to
3152200 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3152201 the united states is a reliable partner in the world
3152202 in my opinion it hurts very much and will cause welts its like throwing a block of ice and its very heavy
3152203 hes a player the manager set his sights on very early
3152204 hes been looked at by a number of clubs but he wanted to come to us he was influenced by the presence of harry redknapp and the players here who can help him develop
3152205 hes a player that wants to progress lassana diarra came here from arsenal because he wanted to play regular football and he has flourished
3152206 kaboul wants to come here and do that as well
3152207 it wasnt a difficult choice to make coming here everyone in the papers was saying i was going to sunderland or aston villa but i only ever wanted to come here
3152208 as soon as i knew they were interested i said i want to come to pompey
3152209 i came here because the manager has wanted me for two years i met him two years ago when i was at auxerre and i like the man because he gives you confidence
3152210 its a good opportunity for me because the club has a lot of ambition
3152211 i think pompey are a top five premier league side and i believe i can achieve what i want to achieve at this club
3152212 weve got the uefa cup as well and i want to go a long way in that
3152213 it does mean that there is a lot of competition for places but thats good it keeps everyone focused
3152214 also i can play in midfield or at the back i dont mind really
3152215 arsenal always wants to play champions league and i think arsenal needs to play champions league
3152216 if you have players like this good players big stadium then i think you need to play in the highest league in europe
3152217 but this is football if you dont win two games then you dont qualify and we play uefa cup
3152218 i know them quite well as i have dutch satellite
3152219 it was quite though a big shock because in holland everyone expected ajax to win and in the end twente played better and these things happen in football
3152220 they had a great year last year but they lost two of their best playmakers karim el ahmadi and orlando engelaar however they got theo janssen from vitesse so they are still in good shape with a good team
3152221 they are really happy with him and almost proud to have him because it was quite a strange move to come from england manager to twente
3152222 but they are all saying they really like his style of coaching
3152223 if you dont qualify as the national team you have some critical people waiting for you
3152224 this is what happened with louis van gaal he was a top manager but he didnt qualify in 2002 when they lost against ireland so thats the risk of the job
3152225 i dont think its smart to play an open game against us as we are quite good in that part everyone knows that
3152226 everyone was really happy for him and proud because its not nothing if you win a euro you really achieve something
3152227 he is really young but as a person hes exactly the same as before
3152228 everyone accepts cesc needs a little more time because he came back at the end of the month but we came back july 21 and we are ready for it
3152229 ivan has a wealth of experience having played at the highest level for many years and he can be a great asset for us
3152230 the young players at this club will really benefit from having him around the place
3152231 he may have ruptured one of the tendons just behind the knee
3152232 we are going to have to have further investigations before we can get a full diagnosis and length of time hell be out though i have to say its going to be for while at least a month probably up to a couple of months
3152233 its a massive blow for us hes very dejected because he had waited so long to get back he has never had an injury of this sort before he has had rotten luck
3152234 we have bobsam with us and we will look at him over the next week
3152235 he has been at gillingham and we are led to believe they were willing to offer him something but the lad wants to play at a higher level so we will see how he gets on
3152236 at approximately 2 30 this morning police were called to a report of a disturbance outside bamboo nightclub
3152237 a 23 year old male was the victim of a minor assault
3152238 as a result two men aged 18 and 19 were arrested and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal
3152239 a 21 year old man was also arrested for a breach of the peace
3152240 he was issued with a fixed penalty notice and later released
3152241 it is always the same for us the opponent is not important the important thing is what we do
3152242 we will qualify for the world cup we will be in south africa i am sure of it
3152243 i watched some games live and saw the rest on tv
3152244 only spain played in a different style only the characteristics of their play was different
3152245 but i have a lot of confidence in my team and i think we will be okay
3152246 i will announce the captain a day before the game
3152247 both parties have agreed on mutually agreeable terms to part company
3152248 it is an amicable arrangement and we appreciate and respect the issues that ruud has highlighted with the club and are very grateful for all the hard work he has contributed while with the organisation hopefully he has laid the foundations for future success for the los angeles galaxy

3152289 i have probably been the leading golfer in europe for close to six years
3152290 and i still get asked if i am the leading player in europe but it is six years i have maintained that a couple of times i might have lost it but more or less for six years
3152291 i didnt play well in the first two rounds so i had a discussion with my trainer back home and it was possible i was dehydrated
3152292 that gave me something to focus on in the last two rounds
3152293 i focused on re hydrating myself whether that was the cause or not i dont know it might have just been tired
3152294 but at least i had something tangible that i could pin it on and try to put effort into it and it gave me the belief that if i get my hydration right my co ordination would come back
3152295 i had to convince myself not to get into this sentimental thinking that maybe it is his turn
3152296 i had to convince myself that it is going to be my day i deserve to win three majors you have to be very selfish in this situation when you are on the golf course

3152303 sixty percent of all hospital patients are paid for by medicare or medicaid or another government program it automatically sets it outside the free market
3152304 it is an extremely competitive market and i think thats why youre seeing so much press and so much interest in these 41 acute care beds
3152305 i cant comment on this issue only soniaji will take a decision
3152306 it was a collective decision of the cabinet and not of an individual
3152307 i have full faith in madam sonia i am sure that she knows what i have done is in the interest of the people and the party i will go by her decision
3152308 the congress president knows everything she knows what is in public interest and what is not whenever she calls me i will go and explain everything i will take a decision about future course only after that i will not quit the party but i will not be a minister while staying in the party i will see how vilasrao deshmukh does his best to bring the shiv sena bjp back to power in maharashtra

3152325 the congress will continue to agitate against the wrong doings of the bsp government at badalpur even if the party leaders are arrested under the national security act nsa

3152481 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones

3152546 we always include cultural components in our seminars whether they be trips to museums in new york newark and philadelphia or musical performances representative of the period under consideration

3152555 when jesus taught that men should not judge others with critical harshness he did not forbid having an honest opinion about the character and conduct of another he was condemning unkind criticism and constant faultfinding such an attitude will be repaid measure for measure it is the law of the harvest sow criticism and reap criticism
3152556 jesus used a typical oriental hyperbole about this which perhaps brought forth a hearty laugh from his hearers he asked why one would try to remove a mote a dust particle a straw a chip a little splinter from anothers eye when there was a beam a rafter a joist a log a fence rail in his own eye one should clean up around his own house before he criticizes the housekeeping of others to be hypercritical is to be hypocritical in such action one deceives himself more that he deceives others love begets love not vicious criticism
3152557 jesus warned against the other extreme careless appraisal of others a person can discriminate between people when he loves them christians are warned against putting sacred and holy things before those who would receive them only to defile them like scavenger dogs would defile something very precious or like repulsive swine would defile costly pearls leaders could cultivate the ability to discern whether an individual is ready or unready to receive a certain truth

3152561 the coffee is empty space and the spoon is the circulating light beam when you stir the coffee with the spoon the coffee or the empty space gets twisted suppose you drop a sugar cube in the coffee if empty space were twisting youd be able to detect it by observing a subatomic particle moving around in the space
3152562 how soon humans will be able to time travel depends largely on the success of these experiments which will take the better part of a decade and depending on breakthroughs technology and funding i believe that human time travel could happen this century
3152563 what is time that is a very very difficult question
3152564 time is a way of separating events from each other even without thinking about time we can see that things change seasons change people change the fact that the world changes is an intrinsic feature of the physical world and time is independent of whether or not we have a name for it
3152565 to physicists time is whats measured by clocks using this definition we can manipulate time by changing the rate of clocks which changes the rate at which events occur einstein showed that time is affected by motion and his theories have been demonstrated experimentally by comparing time on an atomic clock that has traveled around the earth on a jet its slower than a clock on earth
3152566 the grandfather paradox where you go back in time and kill your grandfather is not an issue
3152567 in a sense time travel means that youre traveling both in time and into other universes if you go back into the past youll go into another universe as soon as you arrive at the past youre making a choice and therell be a split our universe will not be affected by what you do in your visit to the past

3152580 previous research has demonstrated that many employers hold negative stereotypes about obese workers and those beliefs contribute to discrimination against overweight workers at virtually every stage of the employment process from hiring to promotion to firing
3152581 this study goes a step further by examining whether there is empirical support for these commonly held negative stereotypes are they based on fact or fiction our results suggest that the answer is fiction
3152582 employers concerned about the fair and effective management of their work force
3152583 should be proactive in preventing negative stereotypes about overweight workers from influencing employment decisions
3152584 the social consequences of obesity include discrimination in employment barriers in education biased attitudes from health care professionals stereotypes in the media and stigma in interpersonal relationships all these factors reduce quality of life for vast numbers of overweight and obese people and have both immediate and long term consequences for their emotional and physical health im to stop the stigma through research education and advocacy were working to draw attention to weight bias and develop strategies to address the issue with various groups including young people families teachers employers and health care professionals

3152604 i was trying to calm him down but he had a pop at me before the last dive
3152605 when we were sitting down i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call but tom went to me what are you on the phone for were in a competition and weve got another dive to do
3152606 that is just thomas being over nervous thats how it was today tom should not be worrying about what im doing today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that for me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform today
3152607 i agree its unusual and strange timing and it tells me they were under stress and pressure
3152608 lowen sign has its graphic and it people on hand allowing for a quicker response time to any problem or question we have
3152609 my agents have the ability to login to their account place an order and see exactly what they are getting before placing the order
3152610 first and foremost the turnaround time that complements the service that lowen sign offers is remarkable
3152611 one of the biggest benefits of working with lowen sign is that we get our signs within six to eight days after placing an order you cant get that kind of turnaround with local people
3152612 many of my agents still prefer the traditional yard signs but the banners are becoming popular as well
3152613 when we were first working out the terms of partnering with lowen sign todd made a point of traveling to omaha and sitting down with my agents and asking them what they needed as well as what he could get for them
3152614 lowen sign has given us great service as well as turnaround times and quality

3152698 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3152699 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience

3152712 is it really true that christopher walken was the first choice for han solo and tom selleck for indiana jones
3152713 its as good a way to start as any though
3152714 it was fun i was never so interested in the heroic part of it this guy is an extraordinary character with an active imagination thats just involved in a chain of events where some elements twist into something else
3152715 warped tour was great but we cant wait to get back into venues that actually have roofs over our heads and arent 110 degrees
3152716 touring with the roots was something weve wanted to do for a while and were real excited its finally happening and estelle opening things up its over tour of the year fans are in store for a real special treat who knows whats gonna happen out there
3152717 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us
3152718 we were talking to lars and he goes were going to take you guys on tour
3152719 nous avons tous la responsabilit de sauver notre pays du stade actuel
3152720 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3152721 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3152722 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3152723 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3152724 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3152725 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3152726 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3152727 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3152728 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3152729 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3152730 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3152731 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work

3152779 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3152780 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3152781 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3152782 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3152783 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3152784 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3152840 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3152841 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3152842 is that the founders of these disciplines envisioned the same thing that you have this broad dispersal of all of the organisms that each happened to be studying and that they would colonize the surface of the earth depending on whether the environment was suitable for them
3152843 before now all biologists could do was look at the biodiversity of microbes that could be cultured in a petri dish we now know that the vast majority of microbial life cannot be kept in captivity now we have the ability to grab dna from the environment and try to characterize different species or taxonomic groups using genetic material allowing our field to blast off
3152844 we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what these patterns look like
3152845 was that the diversity gradient more correlated with temperature than primary productivity

3152847 from our study we saw that environmental selection seemed to play a larger role and was more important for microbes than the plants
3152848 you have to be careful about the conclusions that you make
3152849 so on a 2 000 meter elevation gradient for example the spatial scale relative to the body size of a plant is much much larger when you consider what the universe looks like to a microbe
3152850 diversity patterns on mountainsides have been studied mostly on plants and animals for hundreds of years
3152851 yet microbes are the most diverse set of organisms on earth and they are really important for how ecosystems work our study establishes the first elevation gradient pattern for microbes we found that yes microbes do have a diversity pattern that is similar to what has been studied for plants and animals but the pattern is different than what you see for plants in the rockies and there is much to be done to understand why microbes might have a different biodiversity pattern
3152852 i dont think that microbes are fundamentally different from a biological standpoint from plants and animals i think that we havent figured out how to study them in an analogous way
3152853 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviors from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans rather than learned behaviour
3152854 these findings support evolutionary accounts that pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individuals social status

3152883 the american people rely on museums to preserve and interpret the worlds cultural heritage
3152884 in recent years however the public has come to expect that museums through their collecting activities do not contribute to the illicit trade in cultural property
3152885 the harder thing will be looking at existing collections which is a big job
3152886 the typical damage in this instance would be cracked interior or plaster or drywall glass and potentially even contents that are damaged as a result of shifting
3152887 its the impact of the explosion and then the resulting damage that comes from the impact
3152888 theres also the question of how much of the damage was insured apparently there are quite a few renters in the neighbourhood and many of them did not have tenants insurance
3152889 for as long as you cant operate and youre not making the money that you would normally make theres insurance coverage for that
3152890 its too late after the event to adjust your coverage to cover that sort of thing but the main thing is to get the claim in and hear what your personal situation is from your insurance company
3152891 in the meantime youve got to look after yourself as if you were not insured and youve got to make sure that any damages are mitigated by any actions you can take
3152892 a tie up with spielberg means more business more visibility and greater exposure on the international front

3152897 earlier in the summer we anticipated that she was going to appear in the show but those plans were postponed for personal reasons on ms spellings behalf
3152898 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humour they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3152899 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3152900 i think its important to show what kids really use
3152901 things can take a turn and you can get a big head or get jaded
3152902 the next two weeks were going to be unveiling more and more ads and everybody that we talk to is saying get ready get ready
3152903 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life
3152904 extrapolate these circumstances to the availability of medical services on the two sides and it is clear that even on the doorstep of the global core the medical landscape is anything but flat

3152906 i believe that releasing you now would pose a danger to the canadian public
3152907 i believe that you are involved in organized crime and specifically the head of a mafia organization
3152908 your use of an alias and possession of other documents that were not yours shows me that you are willing to deceive officers and others about what you are doing

3152915 i dont care that the rest of the body things god is leading them to ask me to serve in that role i have never been a and i know i couldnt do it i dont have the talents necessary
3152916 if those 10 families cant agree with the majority thats tough in this church the majority rules if they dont like what we are doing they can go somewhere else
3152917 since god has told me what his will is for this church all you have to do is listen to me anybody who doesnt agree with me is unspiritual and out of gods will

3152934 under glenn tiltons tenure united has gone from being the finest airline in the world with the best route structure and safety record to a shell of its former self he has had every opportunity to turn this company around and tap the abilities of its first class employees but instead he has run it into the ground we believe that with the intense challenges facing our industry united airlines will not be able to thrive as long as glenn tilton with his proven record of incompetence continues as ceo it is time for glenn tilton to go
3152935 this is an obvious and predictable attempt to deflect attention from alpas illegal activity cited in our lawsuit which details the organized and concerted effort to harm our customers our employees and our performance and is part of the unions ongoing two year campaign to intimidate united into reopening a contract that runs through december 2009
3152936 our approach to security software and optimization tools has been to offer consumers the flexibility to choose an appropriate solution whether it is a combination of standalone products or a comprehensive and fully integrated package to meet individual consumer needs

3152954 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3152955 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3152969 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3152970 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3153013 today we need to make more material make it more quickly and in more rapidly changing formats
3153014 we need to distribute it in more channels measure infinitely greater and more timely data streams negotiate with more partners for different kinds of inventory and support it all with an ever growing arsenal of technology and talent a failure in any part of the ecosystem will crash the entire process and its crucial that creative agencies and media agencies work in lockstep every step of the way

3153024 i think i have officially taken up residence on the other side of the looking glass
3153025 conyers could the president order a suspect buried alive yoo uh mr chairman i dont think ive ever given advice that the president could order someone buried alive conyers i didnt ask you if you ever gave him advice i asked you thought the president could order a suspect buried alive yoo well chairman my view right now is that i dont think a president no american president would ever have to order that or feel it necessary to order that conyers i think we understand the games that are being played
3153026 the lawyer who gives such legal advice is not treated as an accomplice it is as though he is the author the act
3153027 the most senior bush administration officials discussed and approved specific details of how high value al qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the central intelligence agency
3153028 well we started to connect the dots in order to protect the american people
3153029 and yes im aware our national security team met on this issue and i approved
3153030 these are questions moltke asked they are questions that the us led prosecution team in nuremberg asked they are questions that americans should be asking today about the conduct of government lawyers who have seriously wounded if not destroyed the geneva system for this issue one nuremberg case forms the key precedent united states v altstoetter also called the reich justice ministry case that case stands for some simple propositions one of them is that lawyers who dispense bad advice about law of armed conflict and whose advice predictably leads to the death or mistreatment of prisoners are war criminals chargeable with potentially capital offenses
3153031 no argument about what yoo did or didnt facilitate or about his special obligations as an attorney makes his conduct morally equivalent to that of his nominal clients secretary rumsfeld et al or comparable to the conduct of interrogators distant in time rank and place
3153032 i have less sympathy however for dean edleys assertion that
3153033 coercion doesnt work you get information that they want to give you that they think is going to stop the pain from happening
3153034 the results of a total of three minutes of severe interrogations of three of the worst terrorists were of immeasurable benefit to the american people a full 25 percent of the human intelligence weve received on al qaeda came from just three minutes worth of rarely used interrogation tactics
3153035 this must stop if it doesnt stop im going to reduce this into writing and im going to cause a big fuss
3153036 lets sort out the facts once weve sorted out the facts then it will be for others to decide what to do
3153037 look philippe september the 11th came the anniversary was coming we were getting information that there were going to be more attacks we had people that we were told had information that we need to do something about and we therefore felt in those circumstances it was right to use all means appropriate and necessarily to get the information but with the benefit of hindsight we realize we fell into error we made a mistake we accept responsibility for that we will learn from those mistakes well make damn sure it doesnt happen again
3153038 undermine d democratic accountability and respect for the rule of law he turns out to mean
3153039 the clinton administrations use of the military in several long term interventions has rendered the war powers resolution a dead letter its failure to obtain affirmative congressional authorization for its conduct is still open to constitutional question
3153040 the administration has used troops not to achieve total victory or to contain the spread of soviet influence but in order to achieve more limited goals whose long term benefits for american security are unclear
3153041 in kosovo american troops serve d under non american commanders such as british general michael jackson this threatens that basic principle of government accountability international or foreign officials have no obligation to pursue american policy nor do they take an oath to uphold the constitution
3153042 in questions of power let no more be said of confidence in man but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution
3153043 to make rules concerning captures on land and water to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces
3153044 we should not use this occasion to circumscribe much less to contract the lawful role of the president as commander in chief i should indulge the widest latitude of interpretation to sustain his exclusive function to command the instruments of national force at least when turned against the outside world for the security of our society but when it is turned inward not because of rebellion but because of a lawful economic struggle between industry and labor it should have no such indulgence
3153045 because many people who do not know us might perhaps assume that johns work is representative of our views as you well know he is as much of an outlier here
3153046 we are not afraid to let john say what he thinks because chris can say what he thinks and if i and many others are right history will show that chris has the better of it academic freedom in a nutshell
3153047 as we worked through the list of techniques myers became increasingly hesitant and troubled
3153048 haynes and rumsfeld had been able to run rings around him
3153049 we never authorised torture we just didnt not what we would do
3153050 he really had taken his eye off the ball he didnt ask too many questions and kept his distance from the decision making process
3153051 i do know that rumsfeld had neutralised the chairman myers in many significant ways the secretary did this by cutting myers out of important communications meetings deliberations and plans at the end of the day however dick myers was not a very powerful chairman in the first place one reason rumsfeld recommended him for the job
3153052 haynes feith yoo bybee gonzalez and at the apex addington should never travel outside the us except perhaps to saudi arabia and israel they broke the law they violated their professional ethical code in future some government may build the case necessary to prosecute them in a foreign court or in an international court
3153053 constitutionalists who disagree had better spend more of their time explaining to their fellow citizens what is wrong with torture
3153054 kindly explain to me how in a state founded by quakers and celebrated for its tolerance free negroes are not allowed to exercise their civil rights they pay their taxes is it not fair that they should have the vote
3153055 if you imagine that our legislators committed such a gross act of injustice and intolerance
3153056 thus the blacks possess the right to vote in this country
3153057 so how does it come about that at the polling booth this morning i did not notice a single negro in the crowd
3153058 it is true that the negroes have the right to participate in the elections but they voluntarily abstain from making an appearance
3153059 it is not that they are refusing to attend but they are afraid of being mistreated in this country it sometimes happens that the law lacks any force when the majority does not support it now the majority is imbued with the strongest of prejudices against the blacks and the magistrates feel they do not have enough strength to guarantee the rights which the legislator has conferred upon them
3153060 so you mean that the majority which has the privilege of enacting the laws also wishes to enjoy the privilege of disobeying them
3153061 the southern slaveholder aristocracy would never have ratified the constitution if they had thought that its proper interpretation would ever piss them off so the first principle of interpreting the constitution of 1789 must be to interpet it in a way that doesnt piss the southern slaveholder aristocracy off
3153062 never complained especially of the dred scott decision because it held that a negro could not be a citizen
3153063 dont care whether slavery is voted up or voted down
3153064 you work and toil and earn bread and ill eat it
3153065 there are only 100 gross of toothbrushes here but well say there are 144 gross because the original contract turns out to have been unfair
3153066 wrong to admit in the constitution the idea that there could be property in men
3153067 no state shall without its consent be affected in its internal police
3153068 this war has pushed georgia further away not just from europe but also complicates the nato council in december
3153069 italy maintains that we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe and on this point we are close to russian prime minister vladimir putins position
3153070 but this makes nato expansion much less likely the last thing the united states needs now is another front thats exactly what russia is taking advantage of
3153071 saakashvili is playing his media game for the conscience of the western world the price is high but he is very convincing
3153072 no one in nato wants to be dragged into a war in the caucasus because of saakashvilis miscalculation
3153073 tiffanys decision to appeal is the right thing to do
3153074 tiffany must ultimately bear the burden of protecting its trademark
3153075 the law is clear it is the trademark owners burden to police its mark and companies like ebay cannot be held liable for trademark infringement based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites
3153076 depending on the quality of the back up processes and the attention spans of storage admins its not unusual for tapes to be incorrectly wiped and placed back in the reuse pile
3153077 many companies find tapes and think theyre blank but need to be sure before putting them into operation they need to now what exists on them in case they need it
3153078 im happy to get the first race jitters sort of out
3153079 the first race is probably one of the most important ones to get it out of your system
3153080 ive seen it done but thats not something i need to learn im just stubborn enough to try it

3153094 to say that i am pleased with the performance of ats during the second quarter is an understatement
3153095 amidst the challenges of escalating fuel prices a softening economy and weaker market conditions atsers have risen to the challenge
3153096 last year presented many distractions for ats with a move to a new state of the art facility in toronto and several major customer initiatives occurring simultaneously however this year it is all about getting down to business re focusing on key operational processes actively pursuing new business opportunities to fulfill capacity and tightening the management of our costs

3153108 i guess thats what got these suspects interested in the area and weve tried to respond because we want to get them out of there
3153109 i was aware there were a couple of armed robberies and that raises grave concerns in my mind and everybody elses mind
3153110 we asked the police what are you doing what can you do
3153111 we dont like to show all our cards when were playing the game but weve been using our resources to address the problem in every way we can
3153112 he was in the process of robbing an individual but there was a shot fired and our officers heard that and were able to apprehend the suspect

3153127 this is the first time that weve been able to take an ancient retrovirus and analyze how it interacts with host defense mechanisms in the laboratory in the present day
3153128 but this is the first time its been shown for this ancient retrovirus
3153129 were looking at things that happened millions and millions of years ago
3153130 but these sorts of ancient interactions may have influenced how humans are able to combat these retroviruses today these proteins help protect us against current retroviruses
3153131 retroviruses are able to infect us and leave remnants in our dna and our dna also holds evidence of what weve done to them in return
3153132 its an illustration of the fight between host and virus
3153133 we gave hamilton four early chances simply by giving the ball away 20 yards from our goal i couldnt believe what i was seeing
3153134 we just didnt play until the final 20 minutes when we had four good chances but prior to that wed have been as well not turning up

3153154 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
3153155 im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
3153156 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
3153157 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
3153158 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
3153159 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
3153160 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
3153161 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
3153162 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts

3153174 the plant death was striking and occurred in most species
3153175 the occurrence of plant death was obvious to everyone living in that area
3153176 drought certainly stands out as a real likely explanation it is an extremely severe event

3153179 well that was a great strip heres ten more years of the same stuff again
3153180 oh i have to sleep with one girl and i like banging chicks
3153181 virtually all production has been shut down because of this
3153182 that was always identified as a huge potential risk for this project
3153183 it demonstrates what the worlds addiction to oil results in
3153184 in order to have the harry potter effect you just need to find the right materials for the visible wavelengths
3153185 and its absolutely thrilling to see were on the right track
3153186 i looked into mr putins eyes and i saw three things a k and a g and a b
3153187 i like to try new things theres just something about the feeling of ice on my nipples that turns me on its so cold and im so hot it gives me goosebumps and its just this super intense sensation that makes me wanna reach down and touch myself
3153188 yes i do and yes it does i like to do it when im masturbating cause sometimes my clit will get sensitive from rubbing it too much but i wont want to stop cumming so ill take a breather and put some ice on my button to cool it down and numb it a little when the ice melts i rub the cold water all over my spread pussy so it mixes with my juices and drips down my slit and into my ass crack it gives me shivers just thinking about it
3153189 first a guy has to lick my pussy lightly and stick his finger in a little bit building me up until im super horny and begging for more then when my pussy is tender and sticky even the lightest blow on my cunny will make me quiver and squirt
3153190 alone should secure his reputation forever but really if you listen to just about anything in the last quarter centurys worth of rap and r amp b you can still hear him
3153191 and i thought to myself just turn on the radio and listen to some of your hip hop stuff thats what ive done lately
3153192 the hippest edgiest track ever to win an academy award for best song
3153193 both the kings and knicks will have some eligible players to be assigned and thats what were here for the league is here for an nba team who wants to have a player get some valuable playing time whos not playing up with the parent club the league thats what it was set up for three years ago weve had great relationships so far and we just know that will continue we set a new record for number of assignments last year with 52 assignments our teams continue to cultivate very good relationships nba head coaches and general managers are feeling more comfortable with assigning their players to our teams
3153194 if you look at the rosters from last year its filled with very talented basketball players guys that have played in the nba that are trying to get back to the nba rookies guys like earl calloway that have a legitimate chance of making nba rosters coming up a lot of young talented players theres some big name players playing mateen cleaves justin reed its not just about the mateen cleaveses and the more well known players who have played in the nba but its identifying the players who may have not gotten as much exposure on the collegiate level whether they played at a smaller division 1 school or they played d ii or d iii naia ciaa junior college we leave no stone unturned when it comes to finding talent thats one of the biggest things that i do with my staff is we want to scout as many players as we possibly can we go international we were at the euro camp in italy about two months ago so we scout on a global level to try and find the best players not in the nba
3153195 tremendous story and nick fazekas and then we had kevinn pinkney in the league last year who did a great job mo charlo who was selected to be on our ambassadors team that played in utah who did a tremendous job great kid excellent defensive player hell get a chance to play in the nba we had gary hill thomas last year so weve had some good local players that have represented themselves well but ramon was a tremendous story he was assigned by the bucks to the tulsa 66ers worked extra hard while on assignment was the leader of that team was the point guard and then he gets recalled and low and behold he sets the franchise record for the bucks and gets 24 assists in a game and was the nba rookie of the month for april i truly believe a lot of that is attributed to the time he spent in our league
3153196 tournament style vote off day 7 nfl qbs up now m leinart vs j p losman pick the winner
3153197 and then there came this big boom and it took the bottom of the garage door right off a steel door
3153198 and the water was so deep i couldnt get my car out
3153199 the firemen picked my grandson up first and put him in the boat and put life jackets on us
3153200 and he carried me out i dont know how he did it
3153201 im a twenty seven year old man and im only five feet one inch tall
3153202 this is a high profile position that requires vast financial knowledge experience and vision
3153203 it also requires skill to manage several asset classes and collaborate with other professionals and our board and to craft articulate and implement a dynamic investment strategy
3153204 were looking for a team player who can direct and nurture investment officers and work hand in hand with our board
3153205 the candidate should also be an effective advocate for calpers and other institutional investors in corporate governance the finance industry and before regulatory and federal bodies
3153206 foi um baque terr vel rog rio uma pessoa querida e todos est o muito tristes o cavalo realmente n o havia se apresentado bem na inspe o de domingo e seria reavaliado hoje hoje ele estava muito melhor e tinha condi es de competir

3153208 o brasil nos deu uma aula de voleibol hoje elas jogaram com o dobro da nossa velocidade estavam concentradas e tecnicamente foram muito melhores
3153209 nosso time e o brasil tiveram experi ncias diferentes elas jogaram partidas de alto n vel internacional na copa do mundo no ano passado e no grand prix semanas atr s enquanto a gente n o conseguiu se classificar para estes torneios
3153210 ruim perder de novo mas jogamos melhor que na estr ia contra a it lia s posso dizer que o brasil um time muito forte e que tivemos maior concentra o que na ltima partida
3153211 apesar de termos jogado bem no primeiro tempo falhamos muito no passe s posso concluir que elas foram magn ficas e infelizmente dependemos de um lance no ltimo arremesso e em handebol tudo pode acontecer vamos aprimorar a nossa t cnica e continuar seguindo a nossa estrat gia disputando jogo a jogo

3153222 pl ne nach tiflis vorzudringen hatten wir nie und haben wir nicht
3153223 dies ist ein versuch georgien v llig zu erobern und zu zerst ren
3153224 kein neues argument in europas geschichte zur rechtfertigung von interventionen
3153225 dass die russischen truppen so schell mobilisiert wurden deutet ganz klar darauf hin dass das eine geplante invasion war
3153226 russland wolle die demokratisch gew hlte regierung in georgien absetzen und einen regimewechsel herbeif hren
3153227 diese situation ist mein schlimmster alptraum ich h tte nie gedacht dass russland so etwas tun k nnte
3153228 ich bereue nicht dass wir unsere armee in den letzten jahren so stark aufger stet haben heute bereue ich lediglich dass wir nicht mehr geld ausgegeben haben
3153229 do you know why its important to be quiet in church
3153230 woe to me i am ruined for i am a man of unclean lips living among a people of unclean lips and my eyes have seen the king the lord almighty

3153232 a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government it can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largess of the public treasury from that time on the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the results that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy which is always followed by a dictatorship the average age of the worlds greatest civilizations has been two hundred years these nations have progressed through this sequence from bondage to spiritual faith from spiritual faith to great courage from courage to liberty from liberty to abundance from abundance to selfishness from selfishness to complacency from complacency to apathy from apathy to dependence from dependency back again into bondage
3153233 earmark has become an pejorative word but what it means is that i go to my colleagues in congress and convince them that unh has the talent and ability to monitor airborne pollutants and needs this money
3153234 it gives us the essence of getting into what we need to know to make intelligent decisions about the environment
3153235 this facility sets us up as an international leader in air quality monitoring
3153236 it gives us the ability to understand the impact of air quality on this region
3153237 escapade johnson and the coffee shop of the living dead
3153238 they are the ones who make those coffee machines well have one to make hot chocolate for the kids
3153239 this will be its first public appearance i saw copies for the first time today with any luck it will be available within a couple days
3153240 it will cost money for both plans to do this thats money we wouldnt be otherwise spending
3153241 all under review we have 90 days and thats what were doing no decision has been made
3153242 the divestiture provisions of house bill 1516 conflict with article 36 a part i of the new hampshire constitution because it would require the board to make investment decisions for the purpose other than providing benefits to members and beneficiaries and divest assets in order to further the foreign policy objectives of the new hampshire legislature
3153243 shall not be encumbered for or diverted to any other purposes
3153244 my concern is that the legislature is stepping into the shoes of the trustees without the attendant fiduciary duties of the trustees
3153245 you dont want the legislature on a whim to do these kinds of things without a benchmark for how serious the thing is
3153246 but in real life theres acting and theres not acting we have real dollars blood money more or less going to the benefit of the public employees of the state
3153247 the ongoing atrocities in the darfur region of the sudan are disturbing and warrant the restrictions on sudan linked investments i encourage the state and the judicial retirement systems to make responsible efforts to comply with new hampshires divestment law i believe strongly it is the right thing and the moral thing to do and can be done without compromising the sound investment strategies adopted by the boards
3153248 i cant imagine the sudan investments are so far superior to anything else out there in the marketplace just like i cant imagine theyd invest in illegal drug sales which obviously would turn a huge profit
3153249 theres no law in the new hampshire constitution or new hampshire code that says you cannot replace poorly performing investments with financially superior alternatives that are not tied up in one of the worst human rights abuses of our time
3153250 the meeting will help the ratepayers to understand how the process works and what their rights are
3153251 in most instances the person has a very specific issue they want to raise
3153252 she is an amazing young lady and the people of iowa love her
3153253 when she goes to the olympics her smile is going to light up the world
3153254 ive never seen anybody like her i was so impressed by her
3153255 our initial involvement was to support an athlete and a fine young lady of our community
3153256 russell would not have wanted this to be a sad or over solemn occasion
3153257 yet we are all left still with a sense of shock at his sudden departure
3153258 he was looking forward to celebrating his 76th birthday he died the day before it and was entertaining on the subject of his bone cancer
3153259 i swallow 17 pills a day he said they dont cure it but they do control it and added with a chuckle only i had to sign a piece of paper promising not to have unprotected sex with anybody
3153260 who is like unto the lord our god who dwelleth on high

3153265 i think its a great idea i know how frustrating it can be to apply for a job and wait endlessly to hear from the company this system will be a big relief for job seekers
3153266 the market is very competitive with poor hr a company might take up to six months to fill a post with this system that can be reduced to about a month the longer a post is left unfilled the more the company loses
3153267 we are already using sniperhire we havent actually heard about this sms update system yet so far there have only been e mail updates but i think it is a very interesting option to consider for the future
3153268 on november 4th voters will change the face of politics and make history
3153269 i am glad that wachovia is at the table with us
3153270 fridays meeting was productive and we made progress toward an agreement that will ensure investors have access to their money
3153271 investors should be able to access their money as promised and i am committed to finding a solution that will make them whole as quickly as possible
3153272 we are meeting with regulators today in jefferson city and look forward to the discussions

3153279 it would be very synergistic if it were doable however we dont see that the regulatory environment has changed since the last time we made comments on the subject

3153298 ruud had an ironclad three year contract so we had to negotiate with him instead of just spitcanning him
3153299 with rudd moving on we believe that this is the right time to make more sweeping changes throughout the organization
3153300 our commitment continues to be focused on not only winning the mls cup this and every season but to build a club capable of competing at the international level this decision is the right one for the organization the right one for the players and the right one for our fans we thank alexi for the tremendous hard work and dedication he brought to his job each and every day

3153311 the 27 year old has made little secret of his desire to move to old trafford

3153314 the new players have come from big leagues croatia and holland and i think that these games are fairly easy for them
3153315 theres going to be a practice this afternoon therell be one tomorrow and well see how it goes ok
3153316 because of the rotation we have right now thats the way it is
3153317 no no decision has been made about the starter im confident we have three guys and were repping them

3153338 the housing market ground to a virtual standstill last month as the drought in the mortgage market helped to drive down the number of homes changing hands to levels not seen for four decades a key survey shows today in the latest symptom of dire housing market conditions the average number of property sales handled by surveyors across the country over the past three months tumbled to only 14 4 or fewer than five a month according to the royal institution of chartered surveyors rics blames the near freeze in housing transactions last month on the scarcity of home loans with would be buyers struggling to secure mortgages and forced to pay significantly more for the loans that can be had the institution also sounds a warning that the market is being further undercut as confused signals from the government over the possibility of future stamp duty concessions from the chancellor deter potential buyers todays rics findings underline the scale of the national housing slump after halifax figures last week showed house prices falling at an 11 per cent annual rate marking the first double digit decline since the end of the last recession in 1992

3153349 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3153350 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3153351 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3153352 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3153358 what made you decide to make minix based on a microkernel rather than a monolithic kernel
3153359 good software engineering principles dictate that your programs are modular you dont want a bug in one piece to bring down the whole thing if that can be avoided a microkernel is much better engineered and is more modular and easier to understand monolithic kernels are still too big and unreliable my metric is the tv set the system should run for 10 years with a total of zero failures for 99 9 of the users

3153469 agreements such as these are important to our students because theyre strong tools used in advising students the agreements allow those students who are interested in transferring to sfa after completing an associate of arts in teaching degree at gcc to be the most efficient in taking classes while they are here on our campus
3153470 the major advantage is that the sfa program is a program providing on line junior and senior level courses for elementary teacher certification the program especially benefits non traditional community college students and people who are changing careers and finding it difficult to attend a university to complete their degree so for gcc it facilitates student transfer to complete elementary education certification for sfa it demonstrates how they are able to pull off an extremely innovative distance education program increase access to higher education for community college students and partner effectively with community colleges

3153516 it now appears that an effort may be underway to depose georgias duly elected government
3153517 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict
3153518 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world
3153519 hola jorge oye que pasa con ese grupo que va delante de nosotros son un poquillo lentos no
3153520 perdieron la vista al intentar salvar de las llamas la sede de nuestro club el a o pasado y en compensaci n les dejamos jugar siempre gratis
3153521 wow look what we can do with graphics these days
3153522 after the wedding of kyrre and shona the mcneils and the s thers must try to set aside their differences and try to live together as one family but combining scottish customs with norwegian traditions and values proves to be anything but easy
3153523 you traded the bluesmobile for a microphone okay i can see that
3153524 but it is important to note that both are in the early stages of development
3153525 i saw a toyota corolla car stopped on the side of road
3153526 then seconds later three military vehicles of foreign troops were about to pass the small car when a strong explosion with dark smoke blackened the area
3153527 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3153528 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3153529 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything
3153530 it seems just unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3153531 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3153532 clearly elisabeth is a victim in this as well obviously she physically was unscathed having to deal with this has been hard for her she has shown incredible strength the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it
3153533 obviously its a lot of tears and a lot of hugs
3153534 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3153535 not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
3153536 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict
3153537 it now appears that an effort may be underway to depose georgias duly elected government
3153538 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3153539 demand a cease fire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3153540 continue efforts to bring a resolution before the u n security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate cease fire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3153541 to say that he slept with her but he wasnt in love with her thats not very chivalrous
3153542 it really surprises me shes not attracted to conventional guys and edwards with his haircut and all is a conventional guy
3153543 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3153544 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3153545 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3153546 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3153547 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3153548 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right
3153549 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3153550 if a contributor lies to campaigns thats outside the control of the campaign
3153551 weve previously found that a low risk lifestyle was very important in preventing coronary heart disease and diabetes and now weve also found that these healthy habits can lower your risk of stroke
3153552 a healthy lifestyle is associated with an 80 percent lower risk for ischemic stroke compared to people who have none of these lifestyle factors
3153553 more than half of ischemic strokes might have been prevented if everyone adhered to these healthy lifestyle factors
3153554 these things you can do yourself without your doctors intervention are very important in making you healthier this study tells us that were in the drivers seat and hopefully gets people more engaged in the process of trying to make themselves healthier
3153555 technological advances mean large ships can catch as many fish in two days as a small pacific nation can in a year with tuna stocks decreasing in other oceans more and more ships are moving into the pacific these practices are not sustainable
3153556 late on friday while attention was focused on the dfait cut the government quietly said it was also ending trade routes a 9 million program run by heritage canada to help artists take their work abroad
3153557 its hard to overstate how low a profile canada has abroad if thats the way the government wants it thats their decision
3153558 the government is committed to a more disciplined approach to managing spending
3153559 certainly we felt some of the groups were not necessarily ones we thought canadians would agree were the best choices to be representing them internationally
3153560 i dont even want to say it their name on the phone
3153561 some of the groups we felt had little to do with our foreign policy or how canadians would want us to be perceived abroad
3153562 abolishing this program is the equivalent of killing the entire culture market abroad
3153563 these all seem to indicate concerns that are based in personal taste and conservative ideology rather than in how to best reflect the diversity of culture in canada and how best to represent canadian cultural expression
3153564 it really does seem to play to the most right wing part of the conservative party
3153565 it doesnt strike me as a strong political strategy for a government that is facing re election and byelections
3153566 we are still supporting arts funding including international arts promotion
3153567 obviously the department is interested in continuing to support canadian artists and entrepreneurs abroad through our network of missions and cultural representatives

3153586 its such a peculiar thing happening so its probably the same person
3153587 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3153588 it must be so hard to be a candidate and have to be responsible for what like 200 people say and do
3153589 i think the one last push movement is a republican fantasy i never see it on liberal websites
3153590 were already a long way down the operational separation route the industry is investing and theyre investing over 1 billion a year in a market thats worth around 6 billion
3153591 so to lay a whole new level of change and even more uncertainty for the business i think would be a real challenge for telecom and could in fact increase costs with perhaps some rather uncertain benefits
3153592 that cant intrinsically be good value for long term holders of a telecommunications stock
3153593 there is not a wider concerted offer behind what we have put together today so far
3153594 without a full scale shareholder revolt it appears an uphill battle to turn around the company
3153595 telecom has carefully considered the implications of structural separation and does not believe that separating our retail and network businesses would be in the best interest of shareholders at this time
3153596 it appears to have started by a lightning strike and they tend to kind of lay there and smolder for quite a while and it just takes the right conditions the right day with a little bit of wind
3153597 and we have had some wind the last few days and that gets it active on the surface and spreads it
3153598 the relative story continues today with markets searching out the positive usd stories and focusing on falling commodity prices this is likely to add to recent weakness in both the nzd and aud throughout asian trading today
3153599 so it was very important that the deq make a ruling on this
3153600 so the ruling is that the deq would require a separate application for the humboldt processing plant and then kennecott would have to file two amendments to the current application for the electric and any hall roads they develop
3153601 once we get to the point where those designs are appropriate we would then go through the appropriate approval process
3153602 if this had been a part of the original application we would have had an opportunity to review their plans review their design and review whether or not we thought it was a good idea or not and that needs to happen
3153603 weve got about 10 million dollars worth of brand new mining equipment sitting out here at the local cat dealership weve got a handful of local civil contractors that have bid and preparing to being work this year on the project
3153604 she has not provided that evidence and it is disappointing that she has chosen to breach the rules relating to dogs and behave in a confrontational manner toward staff
3153605 it makes me feel like im a genius or something like i can do anything
3153606 everybody knew what was going on so it was like you were under the gun so weve got to do what weve got to do
3153607 we stayed focused on our plan those things we saw as distractions even though they were real
3153608 we knew that if we could pump up the eighth graders up to a point where they believed in themselves that could filter over to the seventh and sixth graders
3153609 you could see that pride building back up and once they heard that we made it you could see the sparkle in their eyes
3153610 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3153611 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3153612 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3153613 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3153614 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act

3153618 i saw a lot of yellow ribbons at the church and i was touched by it i asked everyone to pray for my friends
3153619 i was pretty shocked when i heard about it because theres a lot of people that we know on that bus
3153620 so im thinking that could have been us and it made me realize that life is really short and precious and you never know when you know it might can happen to you

3153667 the choice is between the right change and the wrong change
3153668 yderligere i vejret for at bryde vores afh ngighed af olien
3153669 because we find no evidence for a major change in vegetation and or fire dynamics and because the megafauna had relatively low reproductive rates we favour the hypothesis that human hunting led to a rapid population collapse
3153670 in tasmania weve got as good evidence as anywhere that it was a very quick extinction
3153671 if humans had not arrived in australia the megafauna would still be here now thats what i believe
3153672 i think in tasmania the whole show could have been over within a thousand years or so
3153673 the broader picture is the megafauna survived all of those environmental fluctuations in tact but its the arrival of people that is the key factor
3153674 the results show that megafauna persisted in tasmania until at least 41 000 years ago which is similar to or slightly later than the time of extinction on the australian mainland
3153675 importantly that time postdates the establishment of a land bridge across the bass straight and is statistically concordant with the minimum age for the earliest evidence of humans in tasmania
3153676 the evidence that humans cause the extinction of giant ice age mammals in australia by over hunting them is now much stronger
3153677 the big picture that is now much clearer is that when people arrive other animals disappear
3153678 this is a sad and it seems almost inevitable feature of our species impact on nature
3153679 supporters of the rival theory that climate change killed off the megafauna have run out of places to hide
3153680 even more surprisingly his editor should they bother to employ one did not immediately dispatch a swift kick to charlies tea bag

3153684 where matters to be raised are merely embarrassing for the government
3153685 the power could be used to undermine a basic fundamental principle of english law that of open justice
3153686 the government has so far failed to make the case for handing it the power to appoint the coroner disband the jury and hold inquests in secret
3153687 these proposals are completely wrong they allow the secretary of state to remove a case from a jury on the vague ground that it is in the public interest the whole thing is an appalling violation of the separation of powers
3153688 very small number of cases a change to the law may be required to enable inquests to go ahead where highly sensitive material is relevant
3153689 these proposed changes will ensure inquests are as thorough as possible by ensuring that the coroner can always examine all material central to the inquests even if the material cannot be disclosed publicly they will ensure families can have absolute confidence in the conclusion the coroner reaches because the coroner will have had access to all the evidence

3153721 je respectais bien mon contrats cest a dire etre vraiment en cr eation dentreprise
3153722 todos tenemos una motivaci n especial para esta temporada los que repetimos la tenemos a n m s derivada de que el sentimiento de no ganar ning n t tulo doli y siempre del dolor parece que se saca m s motivaci n
3153723 estoy seguro de que no hay ning n equipo que tenga trece jugadores en los juegos pero eso tiene algo de positivo y es que vamos a tener a trece jugadores que van a venir de una competici n de un nivel muy alto y eso les puede ayudar a empezar bien lo complicado ser despu s cuando les llegue el baj n
3153724 una de las dificultades que debemos afrontar es que cuando lleguen los jugadores que ahora est n en los juegos el 2 de septiembre nos quedar una semana para jugar la supercopa ante el ciudad real el d a 7 y dos semanas para el comienzo de la liga asobal el d a 13 y veremos c mo podemos ensamblar al m ximo un equipo en el que cada jugador ha estado compitiendo con distintas selecciones y s lo cuatro han empezado la pretemporada aqu adem s cuando lleguen aqu deber n adaptarse y habituarse a un juego muy distinto del que hacen con sus selecciones y para ello hemos debemos hacer un trabajo en el que estemos todos muy metidos muy atentos y muy concentrado para conocer los principios b sicos de lo que queremos que sea nuestro juego
3153725 tenemos una plantilla amplia con diecisiete jugadores tres de ellos refuerzos de calidad y en ese aspecto tenemos que estar satisfechos aun as la competici n y la competitividad del propio equipo tiene que hacer que en cualquier momento en que haya necesidad o posibilidad de mejorar la plantilla tenemos que estar abiertos a ello
3153726 que hubiese alg n cambio o incorporaci n antes de comenzar la temporada porque hay algunas situaciones de jugadores jerome fern ndez y eric gull que est n en el aire y si las cosas salen bien o ellos encuentran una soluci n a gusto de todos podr a hacerse alg n cambio
3153727 laszlo nagy tuvo que asumir en la temporada pasada quiz s demasiada responsabilidad y eso para cualquier jugador es algo muy complicado por la cantidad de competiciones que se disputan y por su concurso con la selecci n h ngara este a o creo que hay alg n diestro como boldlsen o hansen que puede aportar cosas ah y darle minutos de calidad a la primera l nea y eso tiene que liberar un poco a laszlo
3153728 no tenemos nada que perder no me gustar a que mis jugadores perdiesen contra el escudo contra la grandeza de del bar a podemos perder eso s contra el equipo porque esto es f tbol
3153729 jugaremos contra un equipo que tambi n se equivoca que tiene presi n mucha m s que nosotros y contra un rival que est en medio de muchos cambios seguro que tendr momentos de debilidad si los aprovechamos

3153734 gi la nostra scuola nel suo piccolo ha iniziato a godere i benefici di tali scelte infatti probabilmente siamo lunica scuola della sicilia o almeno una delle pochissime ad avere unaula computer da 16 postazioni funzionante completamente ed esclusivamente col software libero ovvero linux in versione debian ubuntu 7 10 stiamo per istallare la nuova versione 8 04 openoffice amp co quali sono i vantaggi vi narro per iniziare un piccolo aneddoto verso oaula multimediale con linuxttobre del 2007 sono venuto a conoscenza che la nostra scuola era in procinto di ricevere una fornitura di computer per la nuova aula dinformatica il nuovo dirigente scolastico prof vito parisi venuto a conoscenza delle mie competenze nel settore mi chiese di dare unocchiata al contratto di fornitura erano previsti un totale di otto computer con relativo software a pagamento troppo pochi per avere unaula in grado di ospitare una classe sapete com finita con gli stessi soldi grazie anche al vincitore della gara sig barone di gela i computer sono diventati ben 16 dico sedici in grado di soddisfare appieno i bisogni di unintera classe vi chiederete come abbiamo fatto semplice abbiamo sostituito tutto il software a pagamento previsto dalla fornitura che poi non era neppure molto sempre per questioni economiche con software libero e gratuito

3153746 it doesnt look good perhaps we are not going to get a deal
3153747 the major hold up is the refusal by mugabe to cede his executive powers he is only agreeing to a nominal prime minister post for morgan tsvangirai
3153748 they zanu pf are also insisting that mutambara becomes one of the deputy prime ministers obviously that is not acceptable to us
3153749 theres a test system that a particular air force airplane depends on its an electronic system that when youve done maintenance on an airplane you can hook up the test set and run through a set of standard tests to functionally test the plane
3153750 it wasnt the fault of the people who made the system at the beginning the customer didnt require it to be managed
3153751 traditionally the way systems are made and supported is that the organization buys the system and then pays someone like lockheed martin then they turn around and cut a separate contract to lockheed martin to support the plane because of that there has not been a really strong motivation for the maker of the system to make it particularly sustainable in the long term they gladly sell the customer very expensive refreshes to keep the system running thats what they do
3153752 in aviation this concept has been around for a long time its called power by the hour

3153771 i swallow 17 pills a day he said they dont cure it but they do control it and added with a chuckle only i had to sign a piece of paper promising not to have unprotected sex with anybody
3153772 over 70 percent of total global emissions are generated from cities and if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
3153773 argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined
3153774 it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3153775 accounts for 18 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions
3153776 we actually didnt talk much about swimming over the phone
3153777 i just wanted to know when shes returning because im planning to welcome her back
3153778 the whole group of us swimmers richard chng mylene ong sean yap and koh tingting will probably meet tomorrow to discuss where to go with her for a little celebration perhaps dinner and movie
3153779 tao li was happy with her performance although she felt her first 50m was not as good as shed have liked it to be
3153780 i am very proud of tao li who gave an incredible performance
3153781 she is the first singaporean swimmer to make it to an olympic final and to emerge fifth from this very very strong field is a great result
3153782 the noise was just unbearable it went from sounding like a drag queens party to a rock concert the music was just non stop
3153783 i didnt play the music that loudly and it wasnt just cher i used to play heavy metal as well

3153790 resource issues definitely look like theyre oversold but i would say the market sentiment is still very negative so i think they still have room to go down
3153791 commodities are a lot more to do with global growth and i think the worry is that the global economy is actually slowing down and people are fearful that china will definitely slow down after the olympics
3153792 we think pressure is building for the bank to buy back retail clients holdings similar to agreements announced by citigroup ubs and merrill lynch

3153830 we were in the gymnasium and i asked him bryant if i could have my photograph taken with him
3153831 he replied by asking about my hamstring injury and said that i was in his heart i didnt know what to expect from approaching him
3153832 i was so excited that i rang my mother and said kobe asked me about my leg
3153833 i mean wow hes a superstar over here the other night at the opening ceremony there were all these people chanting kobe kobe and i said to one of the coaches i want to get closer to him so i will be on television and he said dont worry about it kid
3153834 thats crazy and he said hes coming to the track to see how i go
3153835 our society has changed women have so many more opportunities now and if we dont change the stereotyped gender roles then the opportunity costs for women will be too high theyre not going to have children or even if they do theyre not going to have very many
3153836 so beyond just money and schemes whats really needed is a mindset and attitudinal change and a significant shift in the relationship if we dont do our fair share of parenting and domestic duties some things are going to give and in our society its going to mean fewer children
3153837 we comment on issues the pope comments on issues its normal for us to have an ethical interpretation
3153838 any increased emission from production of these products in china would likely be outweighed by the positive impacts of their use
3153839 the exporting industry may be more efficient than the national average due to greater foreign investment and newer technology
3153840 china has a very strict regulation for energy intensity for trade products so they actually discourage exports of energy intensive carbon intensive products no matter if this product is consumed in china or abroad
3153841 we still need tremendous efforts to achieve the 20 percent goal
3153842 it has come true now and im going to the major leagues its ridiculous im at a loss for words i really dont know what to say about it ill be smiling forever now this is just awesome awesome
3153843 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion obamas legislative actions in 2003 denying effective protection even to babies born alive during abortions were contrary to the position taken on the same language by even the most liberal members of congress the bill obama killed was virtually identical to the federal bill that even naral ultimately did not oppose
3153844 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
3153845 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
3153846 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade
3153847 said he had opposed the bill because it was poorly drafted and would have threatened the supreme court decision in roe v
3153848 if an abortion is performed or a natural birth occurred at any age even three months and the product of that was living outside the mother and somebody came and shot him i dont think theres any doubt that person would be prosecuted for murder
3153849 it was unbelievable jason finished the race better than we could have asked for
3153850 in the last 50 i was like this is going to be a really close race
3153851 at the end as you could see i was pretty excited i was very emotional
3153852 jasons the most phenomenal closer i have ever seen in my life
3153853 hes been able to get his hand on the wall from behind and also from the front
3153854 i knew it was going to come down to the end and i was hoping to be ahead but i never lost hope
3153855 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50m
3153856 i knew i had to swim my mind out i think i wanted it more than anybody
3153857 someone out there was banging his or her head against the wall
3153858 i went out very fast in the first 50m as i tried to keep up with the leaders pace in the last 50m i really died today i had no energy left
3153859 to make the finals in your first olympics is a wonderful achievement and she tao li has a bright future obviously she knows how to handle pressure well
3153860 i would say london 2012 is looking good for her
3153861 she needs more experience and to put in more hard work she needs to swim among these guys more to stop looking up to them in awe
3153862 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3153863 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3153864 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3153865 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3153866 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3153867 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3153868 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3153869 i had some great winners and got some good balls back
3153870 i really felt i was playing very solid and im really happy with the result because i knew the danger from dmitry
3153871 i had a break against me in the second set and a lot of opportunities to break back but i couldnt so that was tough
3153872 he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me a lot of confidence finally i got the break and match
3153873 it was unwarranted i felt like i should have today off but it was a good practice
3153874 and i have the rest of the day off before i play tomorrow i wanted to go to the market today but we have to play so many matches its rough
3153875 it was a bit of bad luck that i was getting my suit zipped up just before the race and the zip broke so i had to do a quick change
3153876 the racers arent the easiest things to get into so i was a bit stressed out from the nerves
3153877 i used to be a mobile phone salesman but i switched to selling jade three years ago
3153878 the margin on mobile phones is fixed at about 1 50 4 to 2 with jade there is no fixed price i can sell the best pieces for an almost unlimited amount
3153879 our customers are the rich chinese from beijing shanghai guangzhou and shenzen as well as overseas chinese
3153880 the very best stones go for up to a million yuan 205 000
3153881 the people who find those pieces stop working and do the haj to mecca
3153882 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3153883 im deeply concerned about the situation in georgia the united states takes this matter very seriously
3153884 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered
3153885 the united states is working with our european partners to launch international mediation and with the parties to restart their dialogue russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible
3153886 laura and i were also saddened by the attack on an american family and their chinese tour guide today in beijing our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
3153887 master cpl doyle was killed while he was protecting his position and his fellow soldiers

3153891 if you leave that stuff behind i could go with you
3153892 what we need to be very aware of is that there will be a moderation in growth our objective is to avoid slipping into a fundamental economic slowdown that results in increased unemployment
3153893 malaysia may have to brace itself for a more challenging macroeconomic environment in the second half the concern of an economic slowdown seems to preoccupy policy makers slightly more than risks of runaway inflation

3153898 i was set on breastfeeding but my in laws had some misconceptions about it this caused some friction in the family during the early months
3153899 start breastfeeding exclusively as soon as the baby is born for at least six months and after as long as mutually desired
3153900 the mothers who did not breastfeed their babies were not as well educated about breastfeeding with the lack of family support and education they didnt think that breastfeeding was a lifestyle that was possible for them
3153901 i tell them to try but their in laws or husbands may tell them otherwise many mothers start out with the best intentions and then give up after two months
3153902 those on certain strong and toxic medication like cancer drugs or drugs that affect the immune system and brain function should also not breastfeed

3153908 before nato makes any decisions it needs to consult with russia

3153915 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to
3153916 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3153917 in a lot of instances we have this picture of private security as blackwater types ex navy seals but a lot of the contracts in afghanistan as i understand them are with local afghan companies
3153918 what youre really concerned about here is whos got guns and where they are
3153919 dnd should have a single point to co ordinate all of the dnd let contracts and it should probably be the same person who is co ordinating all government of canada let contracts in afghanistan
3153920 private security contractors are used for defensive roles primarily such as perimeter security at designated sites
3153921 clearly state that any use of force must be in accordance with applicable law

3154157 we love golf and unless the game totally breaks down and kills my wii on the next course i would expect my final review to be very positive
3154158 people who take god seriously will not remain silent about their faith they will often disagree about doctrine or policy but they wont be quiet they cant be theyll act on what they believe sometimes at the cost of their reputations and careers obviously the common good demands a respect for other people with different beliefs and a willingness to compromise whenever possible but for catholics the common good can never mean muting themselves in public debate on foundational issues of human dignity christian faith is always personal but never private this is why any notion of tolerance that tries to reduce faith to private idiosyncrasy or a set of opinions that we can indulge at home but need to be quiet about in public will always fail
3154159 how we act works backward on our convictions making them stronger or smothering them under a snowfall of alibis
3154160 are you too deeply occupied to say if my verse is alive
3154161 when giving those things they dont need any more without requesting anything back not only the participants exercise their generosity they strengthen their community ties and promote sustainability and reuse
3154162 i must thank him for explaining his views publicly the brazilian judiciary is not very accountable for its acts so i greatly welcome the judges willingness to debate
3154163 ive been pregnant three times by way of bloggers ive never been pregnant in my life and anything that happens in my personal life is personal i never actually put anything out there nobodys really known who ive dated
3154164 however the resulting glut of imagery data presents a real challenge for limited network bandwidth and memory capacities
3154165 in a sense our technology can be seen as orthogonal to traditional image compression such as jpeg while jpeg looks for correlation at a local scale in the image such as areas of constant color we look for correlation of features at large scales we think that this an exciting technological direction that will enable the representation of complicated 3 d environments on affordable devices
3154166 this is my kind of town libertyville you name it and well have it

3154172 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3154173 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3154174 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3154175 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3154176 the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3154177 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation
3154178 but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3154179 you never know what youre going to get a little lightning a little thunder a little rain thats the way i like to see it because you never know what youre going to get out of the group
3154180 all of the sudden a guy gets in a groove and a good thing is going
3154181 if you got a good thing going instead of worrying about the rotation at that time you feed him until you wear him out and then you go to the next guy
3154182 when theres an opportunity for the guys up front to come off the ball and be physically dominant then you have an opportunity to do a lot of things on offense
3154183 hell move better hell do all sorts of things differently based on not just a number on a scale but on the maturity of his body
3154184 i think the biggest thing is the knowledge of the playbook
3154185 last year it was pretty tough even coming early i really didnt know every single thing about the playbook all my reads all my sights all my hotspots stuff like that
3154186 i felt in the spring time he looked kind of sluggish
3154187 too many times receivers think that getting bigger is better but in his case i thought that he needed to knock off some weight and be leaner
3154188 he has very good hands that at times have been inconsistent
3154189 it would be one thing if you didnt have good hands but if you have good hands and you drop the ball sometimes then that just becomes a level of consistency not about whether you have good hands
3154190 besides being tired it was great because i knew everything and now going into training camp i know so much more than ive ever known

3154195 during the second quarter of 2008 we generated cash flow that allowed us to not only maintain our capital program at forecasted levels but also to reduce our outstanding debt balance by 10 million we currently anticipate drilling 27 to 29 wells for the year with estimated capital expenditures of approximately 66 million we expect to produce between 17 2 to 18 0 bcfe for the year cash settlements on our derivative contracts significantly affected our second quarter results but have subsequently declined with the recent drop in commodity prices july natural gas settlements totaled 4 9 million however our august natural gas settlements were 95 lower totaling only 0 2 million we anticipate our august oil settlement will also be lower when that contract is settled at the end of the month
3154196 at the wish of universal music years of refusal has been put back to a february 2 release there is also at this stage still no us label for the album since morrissey withdrew from decca us after their poor promotion for the greatest hits release
3154197 you piece of shit car youre a piece of shit
3154198 australians dont have much respect for the music press it runs counter to their culture australian rock is all about good on ya mate well done for getting up on stage and switching that amplifier on
3154199 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy everyone is treated equally which means no knocking anyone back however great the temptation thatll be why australian rock is best known to the outside world for such musical abominations as silverchair the vines and savage garden
3154200 its a really poor piece of journalism from a music writer who once had relevance and influence but now hes living in australia he doesnt really have the knowledge or experience of the local industry to back up his opinions
3154201 its just a shame he gets to hide under the masthead of the guardian which gives him credence where none is due
3154202 i think there are parts of the british press that seem to enjoy denigrating their subjects

3154207 who wants to go listen to some carefully hand picked panel discussion where there are exactly equal numbers of right wing left wing girls boys religious secular sephardi ashkenazi theres no end to that kind of madness
3154208 i have the sense the organizers of the conference were going for pro israel pro aliyah bloggers who also get lots of traffic unfortunately that demographic seems to skew somewhat right wing religious just as the actual aliyah statistics do
3154209 at first glance the conference seems stacked in favor of orthodox bloggers with right wing political leanings
3154210 i think what nefesh bnefesh is doing is deceitful a true jewish bloggers conference would be both open to all jewish bloggers and far more balanced
3154211 the first international jewish bloggers convention is open to the entire jewish world
3154212 all official bloggers are welcome and invited to join we dont have a prerequisite if youre orthodox or not if you are on the right or left wing it doesnt matter

3154219 they analyzed data from the national health and nutrition examination survey on 12 000 people aged 20 and older between 1999 and 2004
3154220 more than 33 percent were nearsighted and 36 percent had astigmatism which causes fuzzy vision the team reported another 3 6 percent were farsighted meaning they can see at a distance but not up close
3154221 our estimated prevalence of myopia was higher than the 25 percent reported in previous u s studies and similar in persons under 40 years to that of ethnic chinese persons in singapore
3154222 the first national estimate of its kind bolsters the argument that you can be hefty but still healthy or at least healthier than has been believed

3154227 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3154228 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3154229 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited

3154238 sometimes she cries when she meets or talks with someone close to her especially to her family or to the consulate
3154239 because we find no evidence for a major change in vegetation and or fire dynamics and because the megafauna had relatively low reproductive rates we favour the hypothesis that human hunting led to a rapid population collapse
3154240 in tasmania weve got as good evidence as anywhere that it was a very quick extinction
3154241 if humans had not arrived in australia the megafauna would still be here now thats what i believe
3154242 i think in tasmania the whole show could have been over within a thousand years or so
3154243 the broader picture is the megafauna survived all of those environmental fluctuations in tact but its the arrival of people that is the key factor
3154244 the results show that megafauna persisted in tasmania until at least 41 000 years ago which is similar to or slightly later than the time of extinction on the australian mainland
3154245 importantly that time postdates the establishment of a land bridge across the bass straight and is statistically concordant with the minimum age for the earliest evidence of humans in tasmania
3154246 the evidence that humans cause the extinction of giant ice age mammals in australia by over hunting them is now much stronger
3154247 the big picture that is now much clearer is that when people arrive other animals disappear
3154248 this is a sad and it seems almost inevitable feature of our species impact on nature
3154249 supporters of the rival theory that climate change killed off the megafauna have run out of places to hide

3154281 in his situation hes finally maturing at age 35 actually 34 sometimes its you sometimes its me t o thought for so long it was someone else but at some point maybe it dawns on you that its not everyone elses fault i think once bill parcells left t o realized that jerry jones truly loved him and now he has a quarterback that he feels comfortable with hes listening sometimes you have to understand the reality of the whole situation and i think he did that
3154282 what did we have 30 tds you dont see that type of combination very often thats like marvin harrison we wouldve been up there
3154283 last year was a grind but the injury actually helped acclimate me to being the type of quarterback that ive wanted to be its helped me in certain areas

3154285 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous

3154308 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3154309 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3154310 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3154311 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3154312 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3154313 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3154314 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3154315 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff

3154334 while the governors proposed cuts in local aid may be admirably intended to spread the pain broadly the cbcs proposals to eliminate ineffective economic development programs and close unneeded prisons would save far more money with no harm to public services
3154335 we applaud the governor for coming forward with a set of options that encourages debate on how to curb spending the governor is right to keep pressure on the state legislature and to insist that tax increases be considered only as a last resort

3154344 che cosa ha fatto di male quella donna per essere messa in una cella
3154345 e una indesiderata unemarginata una donna che forse vittima di una tratta e che cerca di vivere o sopravvivere con il proprio corpo e questo in una italia sempre pi intollerante diventata una colpa
3154346 essere poveri sta diventando un crimine e in questa fascia di nuovi perseguitati i pi deboli sono gli immigrati e le donne ci sono troppe lucciole che sono schiave e si vendono sui marciapiedi perch minacciate da chi le ha fatte arrivare in italia
3154347 le retate anti prostituzione continua servono solo a fare impazzire le lucciole che scappano da una citt allaltra o da un quartiere allaltro in cerca di un clima pi tollerante la ragazza fotografata chieder mai aiuto a chi lha trattenuta in quella cella si fider mai delle forze dellordine anche se vittima della tratta non glielo dir e se insieme alle sue colleghe sar cacciata in un cono dombra ancora maggiore ad esempio se sar costretta a prostituirsi in un appartamento non incontrer neppure volontari in grado di spiegargli che pu entrare in un percorso di protezione i sindaci sceriffo stanno cavalcando il tema della prostituzione ottenendo come unico effetto quello di criminalizzare chi avrebbe bisogno di protezione
3154348 trovo vergognoso continua corso riferendosi alla foto quel corpo abbandonato a terra in un comando di polizia municipale trovo vergognoso che i nostri poliziotti carabinieri e vigili urbani controllino gli immigrati senza informarli dei loro diritti e che si scambi la prostituzione per un problema di sicurezza
3154349 siamo scettici nei confronti delle ordinanze dei sindaci nati sulla scia della carta di parma e delle retate anti prostituzione le forze dellordine dovrebbero essere inviate in strada non a fare multe ma a capire i meccanismi che soggiacciono a certi fenomeni dovrebbero essere preparati per leggere i segnali capire se di fronte hanno donne vittime dello sfruttamento o meno sarebbe necessario guardare in faccia la realt e trovare soluzioni pragmatiche ad esempio zone in cui la prostituzione possa avvenire alla luce del sole invece di alimentare o cavalcare politicamente la percezione dinsicurezza dei cittadini
3154350 almeno voi clienti di parma siate onesti voi che siete sempre riusciti a eludere chiss come mai i controlli della municipale e dei carabinieri unitevi per aiutare le donne che stuprate comprategli un appartamento collettivo cos almeno il sindaco sar contento sotto il tappeto della malavita la polvere del degrado non si muove e parma risplender pi che mai
3154351 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3154352 given that mccain by his own admission cant use the internet its a bit of an ironic situation though perhaps it counts as progress of some sort
3154353 i know his grandmother lives in hawaii and i know hawaii is a state but it has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place he should be in myrtle beach
3154354 mccain calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook

3154386 non stato facile trovare laccordo con il napoli perch ero legato con il club per altri 2 anni ma ora tutto risolto ed ho voglia di iniziare questa esperienza nel calcio argentino
3154387 io e roberto siamo buoni amici siamo rimasti in contatto anche quando non ho giocato a napoli quando fece la festa daddio al san paolo mi chiam per invitarmi in quella occasione mi parl del gimnasia e mi chiese se mi fosse piaciuto giocare in argentina la mia risposta fu affermativa e nelle prossime ore quella che era solo un pensiero diventer realt sono contento e mi sento bene fisicamente anche se non sono al 100 con il napoli mi sono allenato lultima settimana ed ho anche giocato a quelli che saranno i miei nuovi tifosi posso solo dire che dar sempre tutto in campo cosi come ho sempre fatto nelle squadre dove ho avuto la fortuna di giocare so che mi aspetta una stagione lunga e complicata anche per lattuale situazione del club ma questo non mi preoccupa anzi sono sicuro che tutto andr bene

3154432 this is wonderful news for the people of louisiana and the governor has done a great job of holding the federal government to its promise of helping louisiana rebuild
3154433 a workable 30 year payment timetable will allow funding to go to other critical priorities especially restoring the coastal wetlands
3154434 our coastal wetlands are louisianas natural hurricane protection systems we must protect these critical natural areas along with strengthening levees
3154435 now we need to make sure that all the available funding is focused on bold projects that build land and restore the wetlands that keep south louisiana safe
3154436 levees alone will never be enough to protect the people of louisiana
3154437 we need to work with mother nature not against her we need to make sure that the funding freed up by this decision goes towards louisianas most urgent priority
3154438 the av companies are getting tens of thousands of new attack samples a week
3154439 and a lot of these samples have to be broken down by their security labs and you can only process so much at a time
3154440 today the threat environment has transformed to a more complex supply chain where players are highly specialized and consequently more productive
3154441 vulnerabilities are sold to software developers who create packaged malware generation software that can then be used by multiple types of attackers and are capable of generating multiple unique targeted attacks and are continuously updated with new exploits
3154442 that will take you to the full page where the show is going on live

3154446 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
3154447 kind of felt violated in a way nobody is prepared to see that so yeah it was pretty scary
3154448 theres a lot of pedophiles in this area and thats what really scares me
3154449 i spend my whole entire fatherhood protecting my children and somebody comes behind me and puts my daughters picture on the internet free for anyone to see that doesnt work for me

3154458 were here today not to really make a suggestion that we change the programs rather we just need more money which of course is the hardest part
3154459 it is very frustrating as a financial aid advisor that you see students who have the need but we dont have the funding for them because our goal is to always give grant money before we give loan money
3154460 i always tell a student i wouldnt let a loan stop me from attending college
3154461 the very things that got it the ppp and also nawaz sharif so many votes are the very things that it is disincentivized from moving on
3154462 it does not want to restore the judges it really does not want to impeach musharraf because it made deals with musharraf and the national reconciliation order of course is the basis that absolves zardari from so much from the alleged and probably likely wrongdoing
3154463 if there were a deal in which zardari got to be president and nawaz got to be prime minister again how would that work you know on one level it sounds like the basis for a concordat
3154464 the army is in kind of a pickle it does not want to defend musharraf
3154465 but it also does not want its institutional equity to be drug dragged through the mud when it is already down and out so i seriously doubt that they are the government going to get the numbers for an impeachment and i think that that is probably going to be communicated to them the government one way or the other and i think the army is going to be pretty active in subverting an impeachment
3154466 i have felt for some time that the army did not want to stick its neck out any more on musharrafs behalf
3154467 and of course musharraf does not control the instruments of government he cannot snap his fingers and have 2 000 people arrested like he used to be able to at what point and with what combination of provocations have things reached a point where the military leadership will say you know what this is not working we are going to have to go back to our old way of doing things
3154468 oh my god what the hell is that coming towards me oh holy crap oh fu
3154469 are you familiar with any studies proving detrimental health effects of either short or long term exposure to wi fi
3154470 i dont feel that i should have to jeopardize my health to secure or maintain employment but allowing oneself to be irradiated is fast becoming a condition of employment for librarians i just said no
3154471 low power has been shown to have numerous biological effects which can lead to serious health consequences including neurological cardiological and hormonal disorders breakdown of the blood brain barrier dna damage cancers diabetes and asthma
3154472 probably not but lets investigate it just to make sure
3154473 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3154474 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3154475 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3154476 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3154477 he certainly picked the wrong time to move this way
3154478 he was upset because the russians were violating georgian airspace i think he thought maybe this was the best time to move he certainly provoked the russians i think the russians were really looking for an excuse and he provided it to them
3154479 no longer is it merely to restore peace and stability in south ossetia
3154480 i think it is to destroy georgian influence in south ossetia and indeed for the most part in abkhazia itself and prepare the way if the russians chose to go in that direction for annexing south ossetia itself and in the case of abkhazia recognize the independence of abkhazia and then work out a different relationship with it
3154481 in part because theyve become very dependent on russian oil and gas particularly gas for example in the case of germany russia provides 42 percent of germanys natural gas so the germans who were probably expected to take the leading role here have been neutralized
3154482 the georgians are blaming the united states and the russians are blaming the united states
3154483 the idea that just giving them a lot of information is going to solve it i think is kind of naive
3154484 certainly its more of a societal problem than it is a school problem
3154485 the anti jesus lies of communists and their scientist running dogs
3154486 i wonder what common force ties all those disparate ideas together
3154487 in any case yes parents dont do a good enough job themselves and that makes me think that perhaps some of the sex education needs to be aimed at parents
3154488 i suppose the murder of a child makes a woman forget all about her attack typical left thinking out of mind out of mind
3154489 if she is a christian she will love with all her heart what the lord has given her
3154490 the anti jesus lies of communists and their scientist running dogs
3154491 if you know someone is against evolution you can pretty much predict their positions on abortion stem cells the death penalty education gw bush and homosexuality
3154492 i guess even they expect a certain level of competence and integrity in the highest office in the land
3154493 maybe if humanity gets dumb enough we wont be able to trash the planet any more

3154495 den russen ist wohl ganz einfach der kragen geplatzt sie sind ohnehin schon durch die pl ne der usa gereizt raketen in polen zu stationieren mit dem einmarsch georgischer truppen nach s dossetien hat der westen aus russischer sicht die rote linie berschritten im umgekehrten fall h tten die usa nicht anders gehandelt wenn die russen bis an ihre grenze vorger ckt w ren
3154496 nach unseren informationen k mpfen bis zu 3000 s ldner die von us milit rexperten gelenkt werden auf georgischer seite gegen russische friedenssoldaten
3154497 bekurow in l ndern wie deutschland und frankreich scheinen sich die medien m he zu geben den konflikt zu verstehen und ausgewogen zu berichten das sagen auch meine kollegen aber vor allem ber cnn und auch ber die bbc bin ich schockiert da sind im bild ganz klar georgische kampfjets zu sehen im text wird von russischen gesprochen und wenn im bild ossetische tote sind spricht der reporter von georgischen opfern wenn ich das sehe f hle ich mich hilflos
3154498 it s a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are trying to get in the way
3154499 el grupo est muy bien nos toc perder contra un gran equipo como lo es lituania en un partido muy parejo que se nos escap sobre el final y que estaba para cualquiera de los dos son cosas que pasan
3154500 es cierto que recibimos un golpe duro pero ya es parte del pasado y ahora hay que salir con todo en todos los partidos que faltan para poder so ar con el podio otra vez
3154501 quiero volver a festejar falta una buena alegr a que ojal sea poder ganar ante australia y despu s volver a casa con una medalla colgada
3154502 ojala que podamos pelear por una medalla el objetivo es muy dif cil pero vamos a luchar hasta el final ganar una medalla es algo nico en los juegos por eso todos tienen el sue o de estar en un podio ol mpico de eso no hay dudas
3154503 vamos creciendo cada d a mejoramos un poco m s yo dir a que hoy estamos mucho mejor que hace una semana y tenemos que seguir por este camino
3154504 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3154505 visit left me even more deeply convinced that we not only have a moral obligation to help displaced iraqi families but also a serious long term national security interest in ending this crisis what we cannot afford in my view is to squander the progress that has been made
3154506 i think he got the better looking side of the gene pool
3154507 has there been one moment on this trail where someone has inspired you to perhaps change your stance on an issue
3154508 we expect monthly sell through to increase by as many as 300 000 units per month beginning in august
3154509 a partir dali acreditei que seria um ator s de cinema viveria disso

3154511 foi um presente esse personagem que o person me deu nunca mais tive um momento t o forte como aquele
3154512 uma situa o esquisita para o artista pois ser lembrado pelo que ele n o fez no passado em vez de ser lembrado pelo que faz no presente
3154513 imagine o que era para um ing nuo ator ir ao festival de acapulco e receber a aten o de luis bu uel cineasta espanhol que me ensinou a tomar cerveja com sal na lata acreditei mesmo naquele glamour todo

3154517 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3154518 they the beastly wicked people shall make war with the saints and conquer them
3154519 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3154520 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3154521 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3154522 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3154523 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
3154524 the need to feel secure the quest for purity and more gentleness in seduction
3154525 a dichotomy emphasized by the pollution alerts on air water and food of theses past few years
3154526 spirituality has been a systematically popular value since the late 90s
3154527 it calms me down and gives me joy its magical
3154528 this workshop allowed them to reflect on their identity an enriching inner exercise that allowed them to transcend a demeaning universe
3154529 i have heard little comments like a rose smells like a toilet or cheese or bread stinks or thyme smells like my daddys car in fact children refer to what they eat when they smell
3154530 seeing their faces light up giving them a moment of escape to alleviate their pain is a wonderful thing it creates real ties between us we send each other postcards and when they can make it to the museum with their parents they always ask to see me

3154534 se eu tiver disponibilidade de escalar for a m xima vou escalar agora se l na frente eu sentir que vai apertar em raz o de uma disputa de t tulo do brasileiro a posso mudar um pouco a nossa filosofia tudo vai depender do momento
3154535 n o vou confirmar a equipe prefiro passar para jogadores primeiro temos que ter um pouco de cuidado pois um jogo bastante dif cil e numa hora como essa temos que trabalhar muito para n o ficarmos dois jogos seguidos sem pontuar
3154536 estou me sentindo muito bem e agora estou ansioso para voltar a disputar uma corrida acredito que n o terei problemas o acidente aconteceu a mais de sete semanas por isso espero n o ter nenhuma surpresa negativa
3154537 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on
3154538 but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3154539 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3154540 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3154541 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3154542 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3154543 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3154544 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3154545 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3154546 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3154547 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3154548 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3154549 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3154550 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3154551 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3154571 we want to change people s ideas of what immigrants are like
3154572 one of our mantras is to build homes for people so that your neighbours are like minded
3154573 at the end of the day homes are a commodity and one home is not that different from another there s only so much you can do to differentiate the product
3154574 we don t want to be competing on price so we had to bring something a little extra to the table
3154575 they re much more educated as to what they re purchasing and i do think a lot of them out there want stuff that s different
3154576 the people that want the stuff that s different they have the money to back it up
3154577 really it s about people who share common lifestyle values and have common interests
3154578 there s greater acknowledgment that as we grow older we often draw back and want to be with people who have shared a similar life experience
3154579 no one wants to have to be one of a kind within a larger group
3154580 if you retire from winterpeg you re probably not going to stay there
3154581 i think the climate s an absolute huge huge factor
3154582 i ve lived in neighbourhoods where it s car grass house car grass house and everybody drives into their garage and nobody talks to anybody i ve gotten rather tired of that
3154583 finding somewhere where people are actively looking to be involved with each other is very appealing at this stage
3154584 people are starting to realize that suburbia can t fulfill their needs for community connection
3154585 what the developers are on to is that people are sorting themselves by their interests
3154586 what we re seeing now is this very very homogeneous sorting that worries me
3154587 i don t want to live around people just like me
3154588 that s a terrible loss if you do that to yourself and to the society
3154589 when you re out in rural property you don t know who s next to you

3154595 this is a voting block that has never been open before and it has opened up at such a time as this
3154596 the majority of people to get their rights restored are democrats and if we get them registered we might overtake the state
3154597 could certainly swing an election but there are millions and millions of voters
3154598 there s also the perception for some reason that they are all black and all democrats and that s certainly not the case
3154599 for those who appreciate dude speak and bozo humour this is a very funny film
3154600 the film is a sleek artistic piece of craftsmanship particularly notable for franz f planers haunting photography and henry mancinis memorably moody score

3154611 standard virtualization allows for power reduction and we knew we could reduce power even more
3154612 the concept of being able to extend the life of the data center by consolidating and driving out operation costs by actively managing power are extremely powerful as customers go green mainly to save green
3154613 i do see livepower and products like it being heavily experimented with by customers today
3154614 i see it as experimental which means most companies are testing it on dev test equipment before they move it into production and if they do move it into production it will be with nonmission critical assets
3154615 california statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education
3154616 has acted as though home schooling is in fact permitted in california
3154617 the most logical interpretation of subsequent legislative enactments and regulatory provisions supports the conclusion that a home school can in fact fall within the private school exception to the general compulsory education law
3154618 we therefore conclude that home schools may constitute private schools
3154619 the statutory permission to home school may constitutionally be overridden in order to protect the safety of a child who has been declared dependent
3154620 i am pleased to inform you that this report is false it is merely a rumor started by someone who obviously is miserable in their own skin that they would even have the notion to attack a child rest assured reginae is tucked away in her bed at this very moment trying to get past the hurt this ugliness has caused her and our family

3154631 we have some ideas and we plan to realise them after this tour
3154632 i was like we have our own reality show we have our own reality show even though it was just one half an hour show on mtv it lasted for us a whole week but we only had a half an hour window on mtv
3154633 we like blaqstarr we dont relate with them very much actually we should do more we do when were in america i think blaqstarr is the one that we relate most we always meet him when were in america but ive never seen boy 8 bit
3154634 it sort of works were the same attitude i suppose for css and for us its all about the party and fun its all about the party and i guess thats where we can relate with css and we dont mind because theyre really big friends of ours
3154635 we were part of the story behind it a lot of songs are about our ex manager which was our ex manager and their ex manager
3154636 we speak english but its different when youre writing songs in english and youre not a native speaker its a really hard job to make something thats not empty
3154637 i know everywhere in the world you can have trash stuff you have the whole white trash thing in america going on but we have our own special kind of thing of white trash which is very dear to me i just love it i absolutely love it its so amazing i wish i could we tried to share it with the rest of the world with bonde do rol its really hard to share its a very unique thing i wish everyone could understand it
3154638 i made all the contact through myspace i havent actually met him my memory is really bad i remember i was going to meet him his first name was sang
3154639 dammit bastard tricked me cause it sounded like a name to me
3154640 the whole blog house scene much of it sounds the same but the thing that he had done that really caught my attention was that he did the glitch like you know when you take the vocal pitches and you chop them he had taken one track of audio of voices and he had overlaid it with another one and he made a chord with it i think its really good that hes getting big now
3154641 that one was so much fun we did that one actually back in brazil it was one of the first remixes we ever did and i really like it the way its chopped up
3154642 he was trying to do an ep with remixes of lightspeed champion cause he really likes lightspeed champion
3154643 he tried to make this brazilian ep out of it but it didnt work out which is a pity cause the remixes are really good
3154644 we played a party for him to help the kids in the favelas and it was super funny we were in canada doing something for the kids in favelas in brazil
3154645 im listening to a lot of dance tracks from the 90s the cheesy ones from kriss kross to the vengaboys im kind of lost song wise im really bored actually
3154646 theyre not blog house and theyre not maximal i really like this idea that we can be an alternative for people that cannot listen to maximal anymore without getting bored its a pity cause i really like it i really do but its everywhere
3154647 we have this idea for a song its sort of like dancehall we thought he would be the right guy to develop it
3154648 the suitable age at which a child should learn about politics is from the moment he or she can talk
3154649 there are a lot of older people who do not vote responsibly as well
3154650 therere schoolchildren who say to me hey i voted for you i said no you didnt youre just 5
3154651 then the child said no no its my family who voted for you
3154652 thats how involved they are you know you cant wait until people are 16 to 18 to talk to them
3154653 but i dont think they should teach partisan politics i think politicians in each constituency should be doing what they can do to ensure that the children are involved

3154656 competition where listeners call in and just rip the cheating dirt bag a new one
3154657 youre running for president and you have your wife go out and do campaign speeches for you i think you cross the line into eternal damnation
3154658 i didnt expect to hit hot buttons on the atheist side as much i expected it on the religious side
3154659 but so far ive had no critical feedback at all from anybody who is religious feeling that we were misrepresenting religion or it was bad to represent religion in the game it was really the atheists
3154660 we have a number of team members that are pretty religious and so in design on the team in our small little microcosm of players out there we tried our best to make sure we werent overtly offending any religious people but yet we wanted to include the idea the concept of religion in the game
3154661 we didnt want to go too far down that path we leave the whole creation of the universe question open obviously as the player youre coming in and playing something like a god directing the evolution of a species but we never really state who you the player are

3154663 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict in south ossetia attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3154664 evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital
3154665 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3154666 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3154667 it is imperative that we move forward and demand that the soviets leave georgia immediately and not burn the bridge to democracy i would like to close by saying citation needed
3154668 whether a presidential candidate should base policy speeches on material from wikipedia is another question entirely
3154669 one of the first countries in the world to adopt christianity as an official religion wikipedia

3154672 the extent of the impact fuel prices are having on our business was underlined when we announced a loss of 663 million hong kong us dollars a95 95 million in our interim results last week
3154673 we have to maximise our earnings during this difficult period which is why we are moving our capacity
3154674 its related to the forward expectation we have of wobbly growth in europe weak growth in the uk indifferent growth in japan and we have a us fed discussing when it will tighten not if

3154676 arbitration means instituting a private jurisdiction by which litigations are withdrawn from the public jurisdictions in order to be resolved by individuals vested for a given case with the powers to judge such litigations
3154677 although deriving its effectiveness from the agreement of the parties as set out in the arbitration agreement it arbitration has a jurisdictional nature involving the application of the rules of procedure
3154678 the validity of arbitral adjudication is directly dependent upon the recognition by the legal system that the arbitral process responds to the felt needs of society
3154679 core legal body within the united nations system in the field of international law with a mandate to coordinate legal activities in this field in order to avoid duplication of effort and to promote efficiency consistency and coherence in the unification and harmonization of international trade law

3154686 the deal gives us access to some of the best minds in the world in the commodities sector
3154687 todays announcement is a testament to our success to date and offers huge promise for the future
3154688 for now its being used for the physical delivery but its failing to attract the liquidity from speculators
3154689 not only offers strong potential from an investment perspective but also constitutes a strategic partnership that will develop our footprint in the middle east
3154690 we continue to expand our product offerings and to invest in our existing products
3154691 we believe we can continue to grow through this economic downturn it would be shortsighted of us to stop development of new projects instead we remain focused on growing dealertrack by providing our customers with the solutions they need to be more efficient
3154692 this visit will open a new page in relations between the two countries which will help to maintain the stability and security in iraq and all the region

3154701 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3154702 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3154703 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3154704 the uighurs are driving cars and motorcycles they have shops but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3154705 if you are a muslim you are already a criminal suspect in the eyes of the chinese
3154706 there may be just a rising sense of resentment and disgruntlement that have led to these attacks on the police
3154707 this is the best period in history in terms of education medical care and religion
3154708 the maoists still have the rebel army confined in camps and weapons in containers and the peace process is yet to be taken to a logical conclusion

3154747 the curtain that supposedly hides the underrepresentation of african americans in dance music is the bullshit illusion that dance music has no race no gender that its about the celebration of some sort of utopian concept
3154748 w hen i play and look out at the white kids in the clubs i hate it may says with pained expression
3154749 race matters everywhere and there are racial matters everywhere but i dont hear many people arguing otherwise in fact im imagining some hippy dippy 90s strawman when i hear it suggested that white people eulogise about how race doesnt matter in dance music ive never heard this argument expanded on much
3154750 i am so tired of hearing that my music is only for white people
3154751 its just complete arrogance for derrick may to say these things just because i have nondistorted kick drums and clear elements instead of dirty sounds in my music doesnt make it white it doesnt mean its not soulful and from the heart

3154998 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tiblisi
3154999 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3155000 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3155001 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a government elected by its people
3155002 an immediate cease fire the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict a return to the military status quo as of aug 6 and a commitment to refrain from the use of force
3155003 russias government must reverse the course that it appears to be on as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3155004 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region

3155095 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3155096 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3155097 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3155098 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3155099 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3155100 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3155101 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3155102 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3155106 this advice on demos is almost a verbatim lift from a piece i wrote over 10 years ago
3155107 our original tips were in a slightly different order the first tip was the same we put the taboo about powerpoint in at 2 etc but we covered every one of these points in the written piece which was on the demo web site for three years in our coaching sessions for demo demonstrators and in articles published in a range of magazines of the 2 200 or so words you included in your blog 1 893 were directly lifted from our piece
3155108 her comment here represents her own opinion and claims not that of demo
3155109 the accusations were made in demos name from a former partner of the event at the very least release the document in question

3155130 for some time now it has been customary to use the word ministries not only for the officia officies and non ordained functions munera exercised by pastors in virtue of the sacrament of orders but also for those exercised by the lay faithful in virtue of their baptismal priesthood the terminological question becomes even more complex and delicate when all the faithful are recognized as having the possibility of supplying by official deputation given by the pastors certain functions more proper to clerics which nevertheless do not require the character of orders it must be admitted that the language becomes doubtful confused and hence not helpful for expressing the doctrine of the faith whenever the difference of essence and not merely of degree between the baptismal priesthood and the ordained priesthood is in any way obscured

3155167 he has had every opportunity to turn this company around and tap the abilities of its first class employees but instead he has run it into the ground
3155168 these dismal numbers speak for themselves they are a reflection of his inability to lead his incompetence as a manager and his failure in virtually every category that can be measured we have tried every conceivable way to convince him to invest in and maximize the goodwill of his employees he has failed miserably
3155169 shrinking the airline to achieve profitability has been demonstrated to be a failed business practice

3155196 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3155197 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3155198 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3155199 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3155200 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3155201 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3155202 we want them to know theyre not in it alone we all have made mistakes in our lives but the child is a responsibility now

3155246 did you know that your great great great great great grandpa had his foot shot off in the revolutionary war and that while he was fighting he once saw george washington himself
3155247 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3155248 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3155249 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3155250 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3155251 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3155252 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3155258 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3155259 traditional media are facing a secular shift as a result of changes in consumer behavior and the migration of advertisers to new platforms
3155260 this has created a challenging environment for our print and tv businesses which has been compounded by the current macro economic climate
3155261 however we believe that the changing media business model also creates a number of opportunities for us both because of our globally recognized brand and our profitable existing digital businesses
3155262 after athens it was hard for me to take the plunge but i decided to i worked hard
3155263 theres not much to say you just have to be at it be at it
3155264 its alright but i sincerely hope it will change the face of olympic sport in india that is not a priority in india
3155265 in truth it has proved a lot more difficult than i anticipated for my family to settle in the area and the club has been very supportive and understanding of my decision
3155266 i would like to thank the players and the fans for their fantastic support and i wish the la galaxy much success in the future
3155267 with ruud moving on we believe that this is the right time to make more sweeping changes throughout the organization
3155268 in the qualification men shoot 60 shots in 105 minutes and women shoot 40 shots in 75 minutes the shots are fired in the standing position at 10m from a target with a 10 ring target of only 0 5 mm the finals consist of 10 shots from the standing position in a time limit of 75 seconds per shot
3155269 i was just waiting for this id have cried if he hadnt won if there was anyone capable of winning gold it was abhinav and watching him win it four years after wed sat there despondent in athens it was just a fantastic feeling he had to do it
3155270 you know he had treated athens like the opportunity of his lifetime which hed missed a technical problem gave him 7th place and i remember him saying he simply wanted to quit because so much effort had come to nothing it was very very difficult to pick up his rifle again but it was a passing phase and it only made him stronger and its only his passion for shooting that pushed him along
3155271 if he wanted his elbow to be positioned in a certain way hed go to great lengths to find out about the exercises thatll help him get it right
3155272 in training he was never satisfied even the 10s had to be the higher 10s 10 5 at least his last shot in the final at beijing was near perfect 10 8 in that pressure situation its something only champions can manage
3155273 it is an amazing feeling to be in a place that is buzzing with world class athletes and everyone soaking up the experience but yet all there with one big purpose the ever elusive gold medal
3155274 its definitely motivating rubbing shoulders with your peers who are all well established in their fields and also with your countrymen a lot of whom you meet for the first time there is a camaraderie in your designated housing blocks which is an experience that one only feels at the games
3155275 today is my day off and so i am going to spend some time soaking in the village and actually getting my mind to do something it has never done before not think about shooting instead of thinking about perfect bulls eyes today i am going to think of the pretty women in the village the weather the great city of beijing and whatever else pops into my mind will be allowed to stay as long it doesnt involve the words rifle shooting in it it is a great time to be an athlete and this event is what we all live for
3155276 the food at these athletes villages is in abundance so much choice that you sometimes get there and spend a good amount of time being confused whether you are really hungry or not
3155277 coppa del monda world cup may 22 may 30 2008
3155278 hes been travelling for the past three months and it was after the world cup in coppa del mondo that he stayed with us for three days then he went to south africa for fitness sessions and to germany for practice before he flew to beijing
3155279 we still remember how he missed his chance during the athens olympics this win has washed away memories of that loss
3155280 abhinav was five years old when he used to practice with his maid he would put a water balloon on her head and aim with the small air gun diana i noticed it one day when i came home after practice and realised that abhinav had talent we straightaway stopped this habit of his and enrolled him with col j s dhillon
3155281 it was in 1995 that we came to chandigarh from dehradun and in the early days abhinav used to go to the patiala ki rao range in chandigarh and later practised at dhillons home but soon we realised that he needed a specialised range i shifted all my export import business from dehradun to chandigarh and when we shifted to this farmhouse we constructed an olympic standard range which has all the necessities
3155282 i always wanted abhinav to train in the best facilities we had some help in the form of mittal champions trust but apart from that all his expenses have been paid by us the government has never supported abhinav and he is very particular about not begging for sponsorship
3155283 i am delighted but now i have a lot of work ahead
3155284 basta operazioni di facciata il governo dovrebbe fare ben altro a cominciare dallapplicazione del testo unico sulla sicurezza
3155285 in risposta allappello del presidente napolitano per le morti bianche dice la russa intendo irrobustire il controllo sui cantieri sempre da parte dei carabinieri con ispezioni a tappeto ma anche a campione

3155287 the city seems to be making every plan it can to limit access to downtown for anyone who wants to protest the rnc or the war

3155291 don loved getting out and meeting the characters who make st paul such a unique place
3155292 an excellent reporter and one of the greatest storytellers about st paul and its people
3155293 he took the stories of the common man and made them come alive for the readers he had a grasp of city history its past and its present that was reflected in what he wrote
3155294 boxmeyer understood there is no such thing as a little person they are the people who do the heavy lifting but they dont have clout or money or influence he was their agent their representative and many times a call from don to a bureaucrat would miraculously solve a problem for some little person
3155295 most of the people i wrote about came away feeling pretty good about it and they became my best sources for other stories i was the amway salesman of columnists
3155296 he understood the city well and was a very fair and good honest reporter people like to criticize the press but you couldnt criticize dons reporting he was fair and even
3155297 for every story he wrote be brought a tip or two for other reporters to follow he welcomed every newcomer and even took new publishers on tours around the city so they could learn the geography and become familiar with some of the overlooked places in town
3155298 i remember how his spirit was so strong even when he was so sick every time i saw him recently he was always outward looking never down or depressed
3155299 a knack for knowing things stories from st paul neighborhoods and beyond
3155300 what royko is for chicago don boxmeyer is for st paul rich or poor wise or weird don boxmeyer has a way of getting to the heart of people
3155301 it was really a tribute to don that so many people showed up that night
3155302 there were people from all walks of life it showed how much people admired and respected him

3155317 with a total of five over 285 after the final round i could have kissed anybody to be in the top ten

3155319 i had a couple of fine months where i regained the kind of form i showed in 2006 the knee still hurts but i guess for me playing for at least 36 weeks per year is the most important and i am going to concentrate on that

3155324 rest assured reginae is tucked away in her bed at this very moment trying to get past the hurt this ugliness has caused her and our family
3155325 i dont think i am beautiful i can look good and i can look ugly whats funny is that when i was younger i wanted everyone to look at me now i like to watch other people because you can learn a lot of interesting things
3155326 the set was very crowded that day and im not sure everyone had a reason to be there
3155327 trying to get her into a sleep induced coma so that they could then give her drugs to heal her brain
3155328 sam said he once dragged britney out of cocaine party
3155329 she was doing so many lines she didnt even know where she was she was stripping in the living room while doing lines with three guys who had sex on their minds
3155330 sam also said that after britney went to court for driving without a license and couldnt drive her children around anymore she went into a rage
3155331 she broke almost every piece of glass in her home and said she wanted to cut herself
3155332 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning
3155333 id wear a v neck shift and a two inch heel even if the president were taller i would keep them low otherwise it gets a little too sexy
3155334 in the end the first lady should be her mans rock and his boulder and his mountain and she should be calling about 50 percent of the shots
3155335 i started calling all these people and everybody was talking to me like i was crazy theyre like well he hasnt won yet but im like yes he has because hes gotten this far i think he gives everybody so much hope
3155336 what gives me tears is if barack obama wins kids are going to say a black man can be president too
3155337 i am not going to realistically be the policy expert on every opinion and position that barack has because i dont have the time to do it quite frankly and i have to be okay with that

3155352 our master has never promised us success he demands obedience he expects faithfulness results are his concern not ours and our reputation is of no consequence at all
3155353 faith isnt the ability to believe long and far into the misty future its simply taking god at his word and taking the next step

3155356 four things to learn in life to think clearly without hurry or confusion to love everybody sincerely to act in everything with the highest motives to trust god unhesitatingly
3155357 be kind for everyone you meet is fighting the hard battle
3155358 our sanctification does not depend as much on changing our activities as it does on doing them for god rather than for ourselves
3155359 friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another what you too i thought i was the only one
3155360 when a poor person dies of hunger it has not happened because god did not take care of him or her it has happened because neither you nor i wanted to give that person what he or she needed
3155361 we can offer up much in the large but to make sacrifices in little things is what we are seldom equal to
3155362 i have found the paradox that if i love until it hurts then there is no hurt but only more love
3155363 nationalists conveniently forget that in ten out of the eleven scottish industry sectors trade with the rest of the uk is a bigger market than all our trade with the rest of the world combined
3155364 im in politics for one reason and that is to break up the uk and so any suggestion of a strengthening of a link between scotland and england is what im opposed to
3155365 the doctrine of the covenant lies at the root of all true theology it has been said that he who well understands the distinction between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace is a master of divinity i am persuaded that most of the mistakes which men make concerning the doctrines of scripture are based upon fundamental errors with regard to the covenant of law and of grace may god grant us the power to instruct and to receive instruction on this vital subject
3155366 our master has never promised us success he demands obedience he expects faithfulness results are his concern not ours and our reputation is of no consequence at all

3155376 my children all swam here since they were little it s a unique pleasure for people who live here i think maybe the city posts the advisories for liability sake so they can t get sued if someone says they came down sick from swimming another resident gordon kelly took this reporter for a swim from the secret access point we picked our way over the small boulders on the bottom and waded into the murky water before swimming in the choppy cove these old timers are tough as nails
3155377 and it s true that the saltwater is good for you cleans out all the toxins
3155378 yeah i could see her doing that i wont say who it is but her name rhymes with seth box
3155379 they georgian troops gathered the girls like cattle locked them up in a building and burnt them alive
3155380 we personally saw how a georgian tank ran over an old woman who was running away with two children they knifed down a year and a half old kid
3155381 a tank with a banner georgian special forces on its front leveled a memorial cemetery in the yard of secondary school 5
3155382 there is no other name but that of genocide to describe the forms the georgian forces action has taken because these acts have become mass scale in nature and have been directed against specific people against the civilian population and against peacekeepers who were carrying out their duties to maintain peace the information we are receiving attests to the fact that crimes of the most serious kind have been committed people have been murdered burned crushed by tanks and had their throats cut
3155383 saddam hussein of course needed to be hanged for destroying several shiite villages but not the current georgian leadership which in less than an hour drove tanks through children and old people and burned people alive in their homes these leaders need to be protected
3155384 it is very clear that the us is reaping in georgia what it sowed in kosovo let us review what happened in that conflict the us attacked a sovereign state and one that happened to be an ally of russia for actions that took place entirely within its own borders and could in no way able construed as aggression against another state it devastated the infrastructure of serbia seized a piece of its territory and then elevated kosovo to the status of an independent puppet state
3155385 i urge every american to call their senators congressmen and the white house and tell them that america needs to stop supporting georgia what saakashvili is doing is no better than what saddam hussein did georgians cut off the water supply a month ago so people have been without water georgian tanks are running over graves
3155386 argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined
3155387 it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3155388 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3155389 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3155390 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3155391 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government
3155392 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3155393 does highlight a trend with other studies linking shortages of vitamin d to increased rates of breast cancer and depression in the elderly
3155394 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3155395 if mr obama wins the presidential election then louis farrakhan rev jeremiah wright and rev michael pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america

3155398 uniting sunni shiite and kurdish political powers is the only way to build a unified and sovereign iraq that would be capable of serving its people and the arab nation
3155399 iraqi and jordanian officials should exchange visits after this trip to discuss mechanisms for boosting bilateral relations in various fields and serve the interests of jordan and iraq
3155400 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3155401 first you have evaluated the priority and necessity of expenditures and reduced some accounts less or not at all and others to a greater extent than the average reduction
3155402 in the process you have weighed the relative necessity of judicial branch expenditures against those in the executive branch and have chosen to assign the highest percentage cut to the judiciary
3155403 second our capacity to reduce expenditures while providing constitutionally mandated judicial services to the citizens of vermont is limited t he organizational structure of the judiciary is largely established by the constitution and acts of the legislature and any of our expenditures are required by law irrespective of funding levels
3155404 its hard to ascertain what they can achieve or cant achieve because there was really no detail provided
3155405 as an independent branch of government we are prepared to accept the average reduction percentage and not more

3155434 doing so causes a number of non optimal things to happen including 1 the compilation of asp net pages takes longer since some batch optimizations are disabled 2 code can execute slower since some additional debug paths are enabled 3 much more memory is used within the application at runtime 4 scripts and images downloaded from the webresources axd handler are not cached
3155435 excessive memory consumption is caused by an unusually large number of loaded assemblies note that if the is set to true batch compilation is disabled

3155439 the style of this book is completely different from the last one
3155440 its brighter but much more twisted the thing that i wanted to bring out is that in testosterone everything was dark but a true man who is uninhibited can do the same thing out in bright daylight
3155441 creating uncensored was an extremely personal intimate mind expanding and learning experience for me
3155442 testosterone was great because it got people from places around the world to see the kind of work i did uncensored takes everything from testosterone and amps it up 150 its personal work not editorial so i did whatever i wanted and had no one directing me i want the reader to open up the first page as if hes getting on a roller coaster for a ride when the roller coaster goes up your stomach starts to get into knots when you see the top of that first hill youre about to drop down on its all over youre hooked i am extremely proud of this book its like disney on crack so get ready
3155443 so the scrutiny turns to girardi to at least ensure that the yankees dont peter out here that they keep grinding so that even if they ultimately miss out on the playoffs for the first time since 1993 they dont embarrass themselves

3155448 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3155449 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3155450 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3155451 the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3155452 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation
3155453 but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3155454 notwithstanding this coming together of the countrys main political parties it is regrettable that our detractors continue to impose sanctions the hideous double standard of western powers exhibits interference in our domestic affairs
3155455 each case takes as long as the panel needs but it is going to be at least another couple of years before all the cases have gone through
3155456 even now some people treated by dr holton are coming forward people have until they are 21 to make a potential claim after that they will be out of time

3155460 everyone has a right to wholesome water and in england we have some of the best tap water in the world with over 99 per cent of public water supplies meeting drinking water standards
3155461 for private supplies though water quality varies much more widely and typically around 50 per cent of private supplies meet the standards
3155462 these proposals will help to ensure that water from private supplies is clean and safe and that people can consume it with confidence and without risk to their health
3155463 we were behind it because she had kids we didnt want to punish her kids for her mistake we gave her a chance we gave her a second chance to do right
3155464 wed like to see her get the remainder of her probation in prison time
3155465 i think thats what its going to take for her to have a wake up call its obvious she has little regard for other peoples safety

3155467 the cynic is humbled the man that laughed sees and is frightened not at prison bars but at his own soul
3155468 it means that well likely see vegetation shift a lot faster than we might think
3155469 the plant death was striking and occurred in most species
3155470 the occurrence of plant death was obvious to everyone living in that area
3155471 drought certainly stands out as a real likely explanation it is an extremely severe event
3155472 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3155473 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3155474 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3155475 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3155476 we are committed to delivering value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner possible

3155482 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3155483 i think we can look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3155484 most people in the u s dont understand the conditions under which the flowers they buy are produced
3155485 it was difficult to campaign against that production until we had an alternative
3155486 one of the effects of the fair trade system is that youre empowering people by not only giving them extra money they also take classes in rudimentary finance accounting project management to manage the extra money they make
3155487 i think were part of a global trend from al gore to the yoga mom going to whole foods to buy organic vegetables
3155488 were all part of something bigger and were finally realizing there are finite resources we need to take care of those and the planet

3155491 what you see before you my friend is the result of a lifetime of chocolate
3155492 think about all of the hungry children in the world
3155493 the red of the fabric burned a fierce impression on my eyes
3155494 these grandmothers were so highly skilled they should be given the chance to do work that matched their skills and be paid for it

3155496 i always warned my children not to work where they have to commit sacrilege to make profit
3155497 i tried to escape but ended up stepping on a landmine both my horses were killed and i was badly injured
3155498 everyone drinks it they all love it even the mullahs
3155499 there is no difference between lors and kurds and others why the kurds always think they are different
3155500 we do not know them as long as they mingle with ordinary people its difficult to tell them apart
3155501 for hundreds of years the region had been an independent kingdom but thailand took direct control of the area in 1902 since then a separatist struggle has simmered
3155502 theres not a single country in the world that is targeting its own people like pakistan
3155503 ive been telling people that this is like a flood if you dont stand up today youll be taken away tomorrow
3155504 then conquer we must when our cause it is just and this be our motto in god is our trust
3155505 i hope frontlines presenting this story helps to speed up the distribution of funds from the philippine government to the people who need them
3155506 cataracts are the leading cause of blindness in the world
3155507 they are great i am very unhappy when i cant see them and very excited about tomorrow
3155508 the operating room looks like something out of a penal colony on devils island
3155509 she can now do a perfect cataract operation in 15 minutes and she trains other surgeons
3155510 life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away
3155511 the decisions that will change our country will not come from above with political decisions they will come from below working with the people
3155512 sometimes its not possible to go by the book in practicing medicine here
3155513 we have to improvise and try to do what we can with what we have
3155514 everything is worse when youre not healthy theres no way to work no way to earn anything at all
3155515 call tom ridge to washington from wherever hes vacationing and put him to work
3155516 mobile living up to its potential is the next big thing and the iphone is really delivering on that promise
3155517 our goal was to show an honest portrayal of what the men and women in the military are really like
3155518 we wanted to tell the story of the war in iraq from outside iraq
3155519 this is my own personal concert before i go back to hell
3155520 it was calos idea to give the camera to sources break down the wall between reporter and producer and talk to real people
3155521 he pushed us to leave polemics about the military out of our stories and to not sit in judgment of the people we talked to
3155522 i am shocked at how much the security has deteriorated
3155523 kirkuk is a crippled city with shortages of water electricity and fuel
3155524 at the moment the kurds are the main force to keep iraq together and build a democratic government
3155525 iraqs oil import and export business seems to be very inefficient

3155533 in the absence of a free press the arts have become a space through which people can observe and debate the social issues of the day
3155534 the first time someone asked us how much our artwork cost we didnt know what to respond
3155535 we didnt have a price because we didnt even know someone could buy something like that
3155536 cuban art has been in such high demand because its so hard to get
3155537 people from abroad want to buy this art because its politically charged and exotic
3155538 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3155539 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3155540 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3155541 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3155542 its jews who believe that christ is the risen savior
3155543 and theyd let us look in through the window they were incredible i really miss that

3155559 post conflict countries that do not respond to the needs of their people can go back into conflict and were very aware of that
3155560 i began to think that liberia which was founded by ex slaves from the united states has a chance to once again live up to its name land of the free
3155561 people may pay more attention to the news but when the news is over when the dam is finished how will the villagers live
3155562 the news wont care anymore what kind of problems do the villagers face how do they live what do they eat how do they breathe these things are what movies portray best
3155563 all the trees have been replaced with cranes theres no more trees theyre all yellow
3155564 you have to recognize that its necessary to adjust and to have people leaving the company as well
3155565 you dont like it but this is part of the economic life
3155566 the people who give us advice by saying the world changes it is necessary to adapt they are of a quiet generation who had a quiet life they are very comfortable
3155567 its easy to preach lessons when you were educated at a time when things were prosperous and stable
3155568 they have no future in their social system and no one to support it
3155569 france has the best health care system in the world
3155570 i love being a barber but its not what i want to do
3155571 the players are not demanding for money to play baseball
3155572 no just put some trophy down lets fight over it thats all

3155575 a child on the street is what we call a roofless and rootless kid hes an unprotected child
3155576 there are people who have become very rich with the advancement of information technology and computers
3155577 but there are also a lot of people who are becoming more and more marginalized
3155578 i feel terribly down when i think of all the children we couldnt help
3155579 i am very proud that our brothers on the street can reach that goal anytime they intentionally want to do it
3155580 were likely to agree that the games are about more than merely medals and marketing
3155581 they dont want the lead up and they dont want the analysis they just want the video and im optimistic that nbc is doing delivering this better than they have before although to watch the mens freestyle swimming relay this morning i still had to download 11 minutes of video and fast forward through the first 6 minutes to get to the race
3155582 i stood up against the brutal baath regime and fought as a peshmerga for my freedom
3155583 i am not going to give up now because of this
3155584 they believe if they can make the coalition forces fail in kirkuk they can make them fail in all iraq the shiites kill sunnis and the sunnis kill shiites but
3155585 you want my daughter to marry your son well so does my neighbor what price are you going to pay me for having a daughter in law
3155586 once upon a time there was a girl whose name was sabina timilsina
3155587 my first trip to nepal was in 1998 when i had been working for microsoft for seven years
3155588 i was burned out i was working the 24 7 full on commando lifestyle always being on call always being on email and i wanted to get away
3155589 not only a country of absolutely spectacular beauty but also a place of crushing poverty
3155590 when wood told me he wanted to out carnegie carnegie i was impressed but skeptical
3155591 with so many problems facing developing countries like nepal could books and libraries alone make a lasting impact

3155595 my haitian adventure the masochistic delight of shooting a documentary about a chaotic first time festival during rainy season in a country where nothing works
3155596 dont let the servants eat until they finish work because if they eat they will feel lazy and wont work
3155597 their dearest one is arrested in the night in the dark and hes been taken somewhere people are very scared and they are very much terrorized
3155598 but if you see such a situation how can you write about development we need to let people know what is the real situation in the country
3155599 your only problem is worrying once you stop you will get pregnant
3155600 will the key to our future actually lie in our fast retreating past
3155601 right now theres nothing running through my head about it there should be but theres not
3155602 im pretty sure im not going to force my kids to do what im supposed to do
3155603 but for me this is what i was taught to do so im going to do it this way
3155604 i am thinking of tony the tiger frosted flakes then lucky charms
3155605 for me the nine days i spent with the asghar family in pakistan
3155606 watching tabriz adjust to the culture and customs was life changing hes just as american as i am
3155607 uganda is gradually removing condoms from its hiv aids strategy and the consequences could be fatal
3155608 delaying sex is a healthy choice for young ugandans but youth have a right to know that there are other effective means of hiv prevention
3155609 recently staged a virginity march in kampala and on world aids day in 2004 called for a national census of virgins
3155610 the western perspective toward aids prevention is largely a result of the 60s faith is a very low value
3155611 in africa 80 percent of the people are peasants theyre largely traditional theyre largely religious and the model that supports them to fight hiv aids is different but theres this one size fits all thats being put on us more condoms more condoms more condoms
3155612 in the first two years since the u s funded focus on abstinence
3155613 and if they knew everybody in the city i mean its impossible that the local police would not but thats that nobody does anything at either end of this problem
3155614 if you educate a boy you educate a person if you educate a girl you educate a family and the next generation
3155615 remittances make up more than a quarter of moldovas gdp a figure exceeded worldwide only in haiti and tonga
3155616 its for my son that i want to stay in the united states
3155617 i cannot see that anyone who breaks the law can demand any rights america is really bankrupt
3155618 this government republican and democratic administrations opened the borders for people to come across
3155619 and they let them work because it was good for the nation if a nation is going to be healthy it has to take responsibility for the families that were formed here and the children that were born here
3155620 i have this kind of image that in america chicago is a boat in the ocean
3155621 not only me they let millions of other families make their lives here
3155622 do you know what they do in mexico to an illegal immigrant
3155623 why carry that flag if you were in that country would you be better off if you love it so much then why are you here why is ins not here checking ids
3155624 give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free

3155626 do you think spelling was in the right for pulling out after getting the shaft
3155627 didnt she open that inn because she suddenly didnt get the inheritance she expected
3155628 if my dad was worth 200 billion or what ever crazy amount he was worth certainly 100s of millions and left me only 800k i would be pissed too sorry if that makes me shallow or matrialistic but so be it
3155629 but she did stick with the show until the end
3155630 mate ive been living with that other blokes name for years it doesnt worry me at all
3155631 if we look at the last world cup two years ago they finished sixth and i would expect a similar finish or indeed better
3155632 in my opinion theyre somewhere between 3 and 6 in the world so a bronze medal is certainly within question
3155633 in previous years theyve been a very defensive oriented team
3155634 and now theyre extremely aggressive in how they play arguably theyre the best pressing side in the world
3155635 if she turns it on and scores a few goals then theyre going to go a long way
3155636 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water
3155637 athletes love the form taste and effectiveness of clif shot bloks but they wanted it wrapped in a package thats easier to use during activity
3155638 as athletes ourselves we appreciate the feedback and designed our new package to be easy to use during training or competition we also care about protecting the places where we all run swim bike snowboard and ski reducing the amount of packaging for shot bloks is an important step in lessening our impact on those outdoor playgrounds

3155678 no hay dudas de que debemos tener el objetivo de limitar los cambios en la temperatura superficial media global de 2 c por encima del nivel preindustrial
3155679 pero dado que ste es un objetivo ambicioso y no sabemos en detalles como limitar las emisiones de gases invernadero para conseguir el objetivo de los dos grados deber amos estar preparados para adaptarnos a 4 c

3155703 la scelta di dedicare un film alla nona sinfonia di beethoven legata principalmente alla mia formazione musicale avrei potuto occuparmi della recherche di proust o del partenone che ha alle spalle una storia straordinaria ma in questo caso avrei dovuto studiare di pi documentarmi su una materia che conosco solo superficialmente spiare le debolezze delle opere darte dei grandi monumenti o dei romanzi antichi un modo per riscoprirne la bellezza pi viva pi reale perch consapevole anche delle imperfezioni in questo senso ho voluto costruire un monumento a beethoven rimettendo in movimento la discussione sul suo lavoro attraverso lo sguardo critico dei personaggi che in un primo momento genera uno shock ma poi dona nuovo dinamismo alla materia ho sempre trovato gli aneddoti legati al ritorno sulle scene di beethoven ormai anziano estremamente affascinanti da narrare perci volevo far conoscere al pubblico la realt dei fatti almeno per quanto ne sappiamo noi cos ho immaginato il musicista come un vecchio pistolero impegnato nel suo ultimo duello e ho scritto la storia sotto forma di sceneggiatura alla fine mi stato proposto anche di dirigerla perch sarebbe stato molto complicato trovare un altro regista pronto ad accostarsi a un lavoro cos anomalo
3155704 quello di locarno un festival internazionale qui c il clima giusto per presentare un lavoro di questo tipo che differisce dalla produzione cinematografica tradizionale in quanto ha una collocazione astratta a cavallo tra cinema e musica inoltre locarno privo di quellisteria tipica di altri festival e una grande fortuna per noi essere qui e siamo fiduciosi che verr data la giusta attenzione al nostro lavoro facciamo volentieri a meno della competizione per goderci lemozione dellanteprima in piazza grande

3155706 su defensa de la cultura y del patrimonio de los pueblos ind genas
3155707 a partir de esta experiencia realiz punalka lo que le permiti hacerse conocida fuera del pa s particip en varios festivales de europa y gan el primer premio festival de las primeras naciones en canad su ltimo trabajo se llama wallmapu es un documental de investigaci n centrado en la lucha por la recuperaci n de las tierras frente a madereras el trabajo recoge varios registros realizados en distintas pocas y formatos que muestran entre otras realidades los enfrentamientos entre mapuches y carabineros
3155708 le escrib a la agrupaci n lulul mawidha porque el premio es a un proyecto no es individual tiene que ver con esta agrupaci n con la situaci n mapuche porque se ha agravado de tal manera que ha traspasado fronteras y ha llegado a europa de cierto modo ellos dicen que est n enterados de lo que ocurre hoy en chile es decir sabemos lo que pasa sabemos que hay comunicadores mapuche que trabajan en dificultades extremas que hay comunicadores ind genas mujeres ind genas que no est n al margen de la lucha mapuche
3155709 yo soy de nueva imperial pero desde muy peque a me traslad a santiago hay ciertas culturas entre las que est la mapuche con fuertes tradiciones las familias mapuches son de cierta manera muy conservadoras y la cultura siempre se mantiene el hecho de vivir en santiago es como vivir en el extranjero de alg n modo comienzas a vivir una vida ajena que no te pertenece de alg n modo eres un extranjero como estar en espa a en europa te puedes dar cuenta de una discriminaci n un poco solapada de alg n modo te das cuenta que no perteneces a ese lugar pese a ello claro te adaptas porque es propio del ser humano la vinculaci n con la cultura mapuche siempre estuvo el otro fen meno de que est s perdiendo parte de tu cultura es m s complejo de entender entiendes que hay cosas que perdiste que son irrecuperables y que hay otras que debes mantener creo que ah hay una conciencia m s pol tica
3155710 en principio en los inicios yo no s lo pretend a denunciar yo quer a informar que la gente supiera lo que estaba sucediendo pero todo es m s complejo que esto la idea m a era ser imparcial pero uno se va involucrando y entra la idea de denuncia de optar por un punto de vista desde el pueblo mapuche mi trabajo se enfocaba hacia all que construy ramos nuestro propio mensaje
3155711 creo que he comenzado otra etapa ahora desde fuera puedo ver de otra forma las cosas creo que el pueblo mapuche est en un proceso distinto o yo lo veo distinto las comunidades saben situar muy bien la problem tica mapuche por lo que mi trabajo creo que ir de otra forma estoy en una b squeda usar el cine solo como denuncia es desperdiciarlo se pueden hacer muchas m s cosas quiero construir o empujar hacia un cine mapuche

3155720 in its private sector absence the iraqi government has been sustaining the economy the way it always has by putting citizens on its payroll since 2005 according to federal budgets the number of government employees has nearly doubled to 2 3 million from 1 2 million some economic advisers and members of parliament worried that a raise for government workers could be a nightmare for others when a sudden flood of cash poured into the market they argued that the raises should be phased in gradually to prevent a spike in inflation which at around 14 percent a sea change from two years ago when it neared 70 percent has largely been tamed by a disciplined fiscal policy robust oil revenues and an influx of low cost imports but iraqi citizens were desperate for the money and lawmakers were thinking about elections

3155813 we received the patient aboard the ship and immediately took the proper steps to take care of her the medical team aboard the mercy took action based on the training they have received and their professional expertise all the hard work paid off because the patient is responding positively to the treatment we are providing
3155814 i couldnt be happier i am very happy because i was quite sick and i am glad i am here
3155815 having three of the four operational virginia class boats and pcu new hampshire at sea is a reflection of the hard work dedication and team work that is our submarine force
3155816 this will become a common occurrence in the future but today its the crowning achievement of a huge cast of people who made it possible
3155817 its a real feather in the cap of the submarine force to be able to take a new design from concept through real employment in such a short time and in such an efficient and effective manner
3155818 without these gifts the children wouldnt have the chance to finish this year and over time the school may be forced to close
3155819 i saw the impact oic donations had on the children in iraq
3155820 i see so many children here who have the same need so i decided to contact them oic and ask for the school supplies
3155821 what we do for them today will have a direct impact on their future and its important they see that people care enough about them and their education to provide them with these things they need to keep going to school
3155822 this is the perfect training opportunity for the militarys humanitarian missions
3155823 we equip and set up just the same way we would going into a disaster site with displaced populations in need of basic health care and the extra benefit is we can help veterans who once served in uniform
3155824 the experience of giving and servicing the community feels good and seeing the look on the vets faces makes me feel good
3155825 these facilities are similar to what we have on ships or overseas facilities so it gives our sailors great training
3155826 many humanitarian missions overseas provide only oral surgery but here we are able to deliver more services and increase oral health which increases a patients overall health
3155827 its been great to be able to integrate with naval forces towards a mutual goal of caring for our nations veterans
3155828 i appreciate the vets and it breaks my heart when they say we thought people forgot about us
3155829 i hope they come here every year we love the navy
3155830 getting that information firsthand from professionals from headquarters gives us an idea of the whys and we have opportunity to ask reasons for change
3155831 this conference is the perfect opportunity for me to network with my counterparts and various people that work in family life programs
3155832 i came from 17 years in marine corps family programs and the navy is very different the services perspective has improved making it more beneficial to families individual augmentees had a lot to do with the navys wider perspective on family dynamics we are now much better equipped
3155833 some of the field staff are unaware of the process they think its a pass fail inspection
3155834 but everything is out in the open these are reviews these are findings with the opportunity to achieve full compliance and be accredited
3155835 our mission is to get military personnel to teach in schools that service low income families and to teach high needs subjects math science and special education its a two fold mission as it also benefits military people in transition
3155836 is hearing the best practices used by other bases to promote military saves and make it successful
3155837 you have joined a very distinguished group of recipients that have demonstrated a commitment to achieving operational excellence we are proud to add your facility to that elite group of recipients
3155838 this is a baseline training so when a submariner goes back to the ship they will be following the same procedures as sailors around the fleet
3155839 some of these guys are electronics technicians and sonar technicians for a lot of them this is the initial medical training they have ever received
3155840 emat team members learn these basic medical emergency skills because there is usually just one hm on board a submarine
3155841 if there were to be a situation which causes multiple casualties on the ship they would be extra hands to give care
3155842 this was somewhat of a refresher but there was a lot of information put out i was really interested in the course and my ship decided it was necessary for me to come
3155843 it was very challenging yet very relevant to what i have and what others may face on board their ships
3155844 navsea as well as its warfare centers and shipyards strives to protect the environment by reducing sources of pollution purchasing environmentally preferable products reducing the use of hazardous materials recycling and ensuring that navy activities do not adversely impact the nations air water and land resources
3155845 norfolk naval shipyard earned a blue award by implementing a department of energy program energy saving performance contract
3155846 its an important program for sailors who are far away from home and want to show some face time with their spouses and children
3155847 the family is able to watch the dvd over and over again and it can be a learning experience for the child at home
3155848 the military program keeps military families strong and connected during deployments through the read aloud experience
3155849 with the dvd they can see us whenever they want to
3155850 i am at peace knowing that they can see me whenever they want by simply turning on a tv set and pressing play
3155851 i like to read to the kids while my husband just takes the time to talk with them
3155852 its a great program because it lets you do whatever you want during the time you are given
3155853 united through reading is a good alternative to e mail or writing a letter because it allows whoever is watching to see the smiles and laughter as they are reading along

3155896 in an interview pierce notes that roth disclosed in a report on may 7 three weeks before the article that it makes a market buys and sells shares for third parties in bidz shares and expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking or other services
3155897 its in our disclosure she says whether he picks up on it or not

3155946 but in high school no one ever talked about college to me high school counselors for the most part dont know who you are dont think you can do it
3155947 there are so many people who have lived here for 20 years and are not citizens
3155948 theyre in the middle not from here and not from there a lot of them dont go to college because of the cost
3155949 the work they mifn do is important because they help people become more educated about the immigration issues and what its like to be an immigrant

3155951 everybodys eating salsa not only eating it but dancing it immigrants have revived lake street we make sure everythings running we cook in the kitchens and clean and work in the yards
3155952 we dont want people to get caught up in the myopic conversation about how we are a nation of laws those are harmful ideologies that are not about bringing people together
3155953 one of the primary reasons people want to immigrate here is that we are a nation of laws
3155954 unlike many areas of the world our legal systems have a high degree of integrity we cannot maintain a generous legal immigration system by excusing widespread illegal immigration
3155955 we do talk about immigration but i really think its more about the organization reaching out to youth and getting people engaged in their communities
3155956 the activities are all about trying to get students to talk about issues at the school and in their lives what their dreams were
3155957 this kind of work is not just some altruistic thing it makes their the students own lives richer
3155958 it takes away fear a lot of my students were afraid to go to lake street opens doors expands their world vision radically changes their lives
3155959 you want to get them to understand that the immigration story relates to all of us but mostly you tell them whatever you have to share share

3156038 walter is a player with tremendous work ethic and showed last year that he is a player that can contribute to this team
3156039 this young man named barack obama got one of those tickets and came over to this country he met this woman whose great great great great grandfather had owned slaves but she had a good idea there was some craziness going on because they looked at each other and they decided that we know that in the world as it had been it might not be possible for us to get together and have a child
3156040 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born so dont tell me i dont have a claim on selma alabama dont tell me im not coming home to selma alabama im here because somebody marched im here because you all sacrificed for me i stand on the shoulders of giants

3156042 every cable and satellite operator compresses network signals according to their bandwidth needs it can vary from market to market household to household
3156043 there are many variables that may affect a transmission signal the transmission to the satellites alone causes some distortion also viewers tv sets cable connections and locations vary widely
3156044 we are rolling out amc hd in some markets but it is not yet widely carried were hoping to expand carriage significantly throughout the year
3156045 you have to give up part of what you thought you were
3156046 thats hard to re invent yourself but its exciting too its existential you are what you make of your life
3156047 i watched a few minutes and i was so confused
3156048 an ultimate story thats being told but also a show that you dont have to watch episodes 1 2 and 3 to tune in to episode 4
3156049 that weird place where medicine and science meets real life
3156050 our intent is that every episode will have a beginning a middle and end in a very standalone type fashion and simultaneously within each episode we will be telling a much larger story throughout
3156051 not necessarily when its going to end but knowing exactly what were driving towards allows us to design these early episodes in such a way that by the time we get to the ending it will be very much the story we set out and intended to tell the whole time
3156052 one of us had an idea about someone getting interrogated in a dream
3156053 the question the question we always ask ourselves is who are the most unlikely characters that you can put into a situation
3156054 in a classic procedural youre characters are there because theyre assigned to be
3156055 in this one they have to choose each other peter has to want to stay his father has to continue to behave and theyre choosing each other every week and thats actually a great loaded character thing you dont have in a regular procedural
3156056 however hes always unpredictable so at any moment he can always snap back to the place that he was at
3156057 ill get emails from j j or one of the other writers did you read this a guy lost the tip of his finger they were developing a powder and he rubbed it on there and it grew back after four and a half months this is not something im reading on some tabloid its on cnn com or whatever
3156058 i keep saying somewhere in the world someone may have one of your hairs and in a garage and theyre cloning you and whos doing that
3156059 people who have the ability to do these things are not necessarily coming from benevolent backgrounds
3156060 what cable offers is the idea that they have more time to tell stories than you do on network television
3156061 the fact that fox is trying this new thing more content and less commercials not just behooves the viewer but really behooves us as storytellers it allows us not just to tell more story but to ramp up more and have more content
3156062 the attention that the show is getting we cant hide behind oh they didnt promote it nobody knew about it its no one but us its our fault if it doesnt work
3156063 i think a match like that deserves the fans emotional investment its way too soon its just an attraction match and i think its more valuable than that i think its been wasted a little bit

3156066 the irritating ignorance political insensitivity double standards and patronizing arrogance that characterize western diplomacy with respect to our country
3156067 as we finalize the political settlement to the impasse in our country we have heard sentiments from the west indicating that they will look at the agreement and decide whether it is acceptable to them who are they to superintend judge and grade a collective decision by africans it is not the place for western governments or their institutions to determine whether the agreement is right or wrong it is strictly none of their business

3156069 the mbta will reserve comment on the substance of the presentation until staff has had a sufficient period of time to thoroughly review the information and meet with the students and their professor
3156070 this is not simply saying we did it arent we inventive its also providing a tool to help accomplish this our understanding is that these would likely be software tools that would make it easier to analyze the cards
3156071 you plug the car into an outlet and that charges all the batteries

3156082 wilma epitomized the definition of the complete catholic layperson who is both prayerful and charitable
3156083 she was very ecumenical in her concerns and interests and spread the good news in every direction
3156084 she had a passion for telling good stories a passion for people and a passion for understanding how religion works in the lives of people
3156085 though an avid roman catholic it was always clear she had great respect for other parts of the christian church and for people of other faiths
3156086 i dont know what possessed her to ask to start writing the column
3156087 she got myriad phone calls every day from people who wanted to talk with her about their religious experiences and how the column revitalized their spirituality
3156088 along the way as i tell people the record baptized me my faith life has been shaped and enriched by christians and jews i interviewed for columns and features
3156089 it has been wisely said that the only gifts we ever keep are those we give away and the gift of my faith grows as i share an awareness of gods presence in the lives of all people at times patients fill my empty hands with their own deep faith
3156090 we were talking and reminiscing and wilma said are you going to say a prayer with me
3156091 the prayer was a thanksgiving for her life and the gift that she was to us
3156092 my aunt was totally devoted to her nieces and nephews and even more so to her grandnieces and grandnephews
3156093 her two favorite places were a baseball field and the new jersey shore her favorite colors were green for the baseball field and blue for the ocean she was very at ease at the ocean and drew her energy from there

3156122 many useful comparisons involve only the order of magnitude of lines of code in a project
3156123 i built this application that interacts with a whole slew of online photo services and migrates all your photos and does all this neat stuff and it was only 5 000 lines
3156124 its only one line so it must have fewer bugs than a 50 line solution

3156133 we present logically qualified data types abbreviated to liquid types a system that combines hindley milner type inference with predicate abstraction to automatically infer dependent types precise enough to prove a variety of safety properties
3156134 save and close the text editor and now reboot this disadvantage could be there to method of compiling we used i am not sure but the problem is that usually when you suspend to disk and turn on the machine again grub directly boots opensuse but now the grub prompt will show up and ask you which os you want to boot along with which kernel for that os as well for example if you have opensuse 11 0 kernel 2 6 26 opensuse 11 0 kernel 2 6 25 you will have to choose the kernel version you actually suspended to disk this may not be that big of a deal though cause it doesnt really bother me since the first option is the kernel i use anyway how to delete a manually compiled kernel using the method posted here lets say you compiled kernel 2 6 26 using this method and now you have even compiled kernel 2 6 27 now you feel like deleting kernel 2 6 26 so how do you that gnome users type in gnomesu nautilus boot

3156145 we are encouraged by the strength of our financial results to date and see substantial opportunity for the balance of the year
3156146 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3156147 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
3156148 this is not an easy thing to do think about trying to drink water through a narrow 350 foot long straw it takes a lot of suction
3156149 higher and higher in the tree the valves are able to withstand more pulling force from the long heavy column of water before air bubbles can be sucked through
3156150 but the problem is that the valves become less efficient at letting water pass the height at which no water would pass at all according to our models coincides the tallest records for douglas fir about 350 to 400 feet
3156151 as you go higher and higher in a douglas fir tree its almost like experiencing a drought
3156152 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviours from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity
3156153 anecdotal evidence mentioned in the paper suggests that yes the human pride and shame displays are very similar to non human displays of dominance and submission seen in a wide range of animals
3156154 pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individuals social status
3156155 for these wild chillies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3156156 both the fungus and the birds eat chillies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3156157 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3156158 having such a specific defence one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant
3156159 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defence levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3156160 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3156161 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chillies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3156162 it came out to most cases anywhere from 12 13 some went up maybe 21 percent just kinda depends on the newness of the property
3156163 because i didnt do any improvements that would cause my property to be assessed at another lever thats the only reason i hope they dont come up with another one laughs

3156176 the experience was very positive because most shows are too technical for the public
3156177 with the live algae we can explain to children and families how algae grow and how we extract the oil and convert it to jet fuel
3156178 however they expressed great interest in the growing algae and the potential it has for production of oil that can be used for transportation fuel especially since using algae eliminates the problem associated with converting crop foods to fuel
3156179 the critical issue is the biomass feedstock not oil conversion
3156180 to bring the cost down we need much more breakthroughs and innovations bioreactors are expensive at this stage we need a cost efficient way to sustain high growth
3156181 our effort will be geared to developing a pilot scale facility that will enable us to integrate various components of oil production and evaluate the economics of the process
3156182 since asu is a leader in developing approaches to sustainability it could for example incorporate the use of algae produced biofuels on some of its vehicles over the next several years as our production increases
3156183 these kinds of trips give me a lot of fodder for class discussions
3156184 im a historian of the southwest and im always interested in ways of making history accessible to the general audience
3156185 murder at sleepy lagoon zoot suits race and riot in world war ii l a
3156186 most people dont seem to be aware of the fact that the history of phoenix as a site of human civilization stretches all the way back in time to before the fall of rome
3156187 although this particular collection of historic photographs does not cover the pre mexican and anglo occupation of the area i did try to provide that sense of antiquity in my introductory chapters
3156188 the coffee table book in my opinion must serve a difficult double role it must be both visually stunning and editorially engaging it employs high resolution digital photographs that require nearly as much qualitative text to thoroughly engage the reader the judges and the abpa believe dr pag n and turner publishing skillfully achieved both of these goals
3156189 the present is a direct result of the past so understanding the past helps us better understand the present
3156190 but i fear that we in the valley generally do not appreciate our history and in fact have actively disregarded it in important ways
3156191 its hard to separate the growth of the valley from the growth of phoenix which has been nothing less than phenomenal when i was born in 1960 the population of phoenix was about 400 000 and now it is well over 1 5 million when i was young there were clear delineations between phoenix and mesa tempe chandler gilbert litchfield park peoria and so on you knew when you left one town and entered another because towns in the valley were separated by space and each had a different look and feel now those geographical delineations are all but gone and although there are still differences between many of the towns in the valley those differences are quite subtle now most of the valley in my mind at least has become a part of greater phoenix
3156192 the arizona book awards are meant to help to promote and support quality work created in or about arizona and to recognize excellence in craft and creation in the arizona book industry
3156193 we are thrilled to be spreading the word about the arizona publishing front
3156194 by including teachers for the first time in our internship program we are helping them introduce more students to potential bioscience careers than ever before with a potential impact on more than 4 000 arizona high school students in the coming academic year
3156195 the timing couldnt have been better as more arizona high schools develop biotechnology programs teachers can use their biodesign experience to bolster their expertise and curriculum development
3156196 introducing science concepts to students this early will reap a lot of rewards for building a brain based industry like biotechnology
3156197 ive always loved science although sometimes the work can be a little difficult to explain to my parents
3156198 we didnt even extract dna when i was in college so this is all new to me
3156199 the biodesign institute is a very stimulating environment where everyone encourages you to think out of the box

3156202 a central premise of this guidebook is that gang problems are local and solutions must be based on improving understanding of the nature of those problems and the immediate underlying conditions that give rise to them
3156203 widely regarded in the field for his research on gang activity dr decker offers sensible information for local agencies to use in developing responses to their specific gang problem
3156204 the reality is that most responses to problems such as gang crime do not succeed at least in their first design
3156205 it is therefore important to document the process of designing and implementing a response so that the responding jurisdiction and others can be more successful in the future
3156206 all four components of sara are critical the model requires careful analysis before creating interventions
3156207 the gang problem is highly dynamic its important to avoid developing a fixed image of a problem that does not change as the problem changes
3156208 growing evidence shows that sustained application of the sara model greatly improves the law enforcement response to gangs and leads to safer communities
3156209 the good news is that many police departments are improving their effectiveness at developing and implementing problem solving strategies
3156210 we are seeing more organizations using data based strategic responses to issues like gang crime rather than simply putting the same fire out over and over

3156389 in het begin sloeg ik de kinderen met mijn hand maar nu gebruik ik de roede ook in de bijbel spreekt men van roedes
3156390 in de bijbel staat dat kinderen hun ouders moeten gehoorzamen maar kinderen doen dat niet automatisch je moet hen dat aanleren

3156398 what did you do to get your players to kill their own super egos
3156399 we have a saying that you play for the name on the front of the guernsey not the back of guernsey all our players play for the front of the guernsey
3156400 they are heroes for some of our players this makes things psychologically difficult
3156401 when you start a sport it is always a dream to go to the olympics or be a pro athlete so it has always been a dream and an aspiration but i definitely never imagined it would happen this early
3156402 the team left two weeks ago to go to singapore and adapt to all the time differences
3156403 while they were out there one of the players reinjured her knee and they had to bring one of the alternates in i was just hanging out in washington and got a phone call from the team manager saying that i needed to be prepared to go and get ready in case a call up happens

3156406 she helped me make decisions with the team and she helped me choose what i was going to do with vanderbilt either way she said she was going to be there for me shes been really helpful with the whole decision process and she helped me get through some of the hard times
3156407 for her to be representing canada at the olympics and then again at the u 20 world cup is such a tremendous honor
3156408 i think that we are going to have an incredibly exciting player to watch in
3156409 with her being on our field for four years she has a chance to change vanderbilt soccer because of her international experience and her overall commitment and excitement about attending vanderbilt she loves to play soccer and she has an infectious personality

3156482 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3156483 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3156484 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3156485 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3156486 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3156487 we said that we would challenge the faa decision in a court of law and we are doing just that
3156488 today we have started the process to protect our members rights
3156489 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3156490 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3156491 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3156492 there is a message here for both publishers and networks about being better partners and indications going forward for how to best manage inventory and sales relationships
3156493 this study is an opportunity to begin to understand some very complex marketplace dynamics
3156494 online publishers are producing more inventory than the market demands and risk devaluing the premium nature of their brands particularly in light of ad networks growth and their dramatically lower pricing
3156495 building more effective relationships between publishers and ad networks is critical in the longer term both parties will benefit from gains in ad network cpms

3156520 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3156521 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3156522 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government
3156523 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3156524 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3156525 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3156526 as you may know if a candidate fails to get at least 15 at a precinct caucus their supporters can switch and choose to caucus with those backing other candidates or declare themselves uncommitted
3156527 if the presidential caucus in iowa were held today please tell me which of the following people would be your second choice
3156528 what the church is for rather than what it is against
3156529 drive the issue of abortion like a wedge into the soul of the nation
3156530 2 3 billion people in the world claim to be followers of jesus
3156531 the old paradigm was you pay you pray you get out of the way
3156532 theres a church in every village in the world the potential sits there like a sleeping giant
3156533 the new testament says the church is the body of christ but for the last 100 years the hands and feet have been amputated and the church has just been a mouth and mostly its been known for what its against
3156534 im so tired of christians being known for what theyre against
3156535 one of my goals is to take evangelicals back a century to the 19th century
3156536 that was a time of muscular christianity that cared about every aspect of life
3156537 im worried that evangelicals be identified too much with one party or the other when that happens you lose your prophetic role of speaking truth to power
3156538 and you have to defend stupid things that leaders do
3156539 politics is always downstream from culture i place less confidence in it than a lot of folks i dont think thats the answer politics is not the right tool to change the culture
3156540 what the church is for rather than what it is against
3156541 drive the issue of abortion like a wedge into the soul of the nation
3156542 zanu pf and its allies are still committing violent abuses undermining the partys credibility as a political partner
3156543 instead of focusing on quick political fixes president thabo mbeki and other sadc leaders should look for a durable solution and that means first of all an immediate end to human rights violations
3156544 i am an old woman and they beat me like a dog no a wild animal they insulted me they beat me on the back and in the ribs my only crime was that my son was an mdc councilor i am in great pain now my son is in the mortuary i am unable to bury him i will not be there when he is buried if he is buried i regret being alive my life is ruined my home is destroyed and my sons life was taken in cold blood
3156545 there can be no trade off between the political process and the need for justice and an end to human rights abuses said gagnon
3156546 the zimbabwean governments refusal to account for serious crimes will only damage the prospects for political stability in zimbabwe sadc leaders can make a difference by insisting that abusers be held to account under any political deal

3156575 some of the successful clubs play dull boring football its all about kick chase and field position
3156576 but the raiders take a more positive attitude and they are prepared to chance their hand
3156577 they know they dont have the best playing roster and that doesnt allow them to play grafting grinding footy

3156621 just because you love someone doesnt mean you have to be involved with them
3156622 love david love do you love her does the thought of her the smell of her the touch of her make you quiver when shes away from you do you wish she were in your arms making love to you when you see her after not seeing her for a whole day does she make everything better

3156768 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3156769 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

3156772 congress shouldnt have left on recess without dealing with our energy policy
3156773 lets dont leave without taking a rational step for a broad based energy plan
3156774 its very rare that people get to come down and sit in a members chair on the house floor
3156775 its a broad based plan but it does include drilling
3156776 the drilling industry today is far more environmentally responsible today we need to exploit our resources and we need to continue to power and drive our economy
3156777 were not going to be able to offset all that oil but every barrel we produce is a barrel we dont have to buy from hugo chavez and other nations
3156778 but we have to do this thoughtfully and in a way we can afford and in a way thats responsible to our grandchildren and the environment theyre going to live in

3156781 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3156782 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3156783 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3156784 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3156785 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3156786 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3156787 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3156788 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3156789 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3156790 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3156791 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3156792 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3156793 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3156794 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3156795 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3156796 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3156797 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3156798 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3156799 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3156800 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3156801 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3156802 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3156803 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3156804 who are open to doing something on the production side
3156805 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3156806 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3156807 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3156808 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3156809 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3156810 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3156811 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3156812 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3156813 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3156814 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3156815 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3156816 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3156817 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3156818 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3156819 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3156820 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3156821 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3156822 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3156823 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3156824 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3156825 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3156826 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3156827 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3156828 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3156829 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3156830 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3156831 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3156832 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3156833 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3156834 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3156835 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3156836 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3156837 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3156838 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3156839 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3156840 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3156841 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3156842 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3156843 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3156844 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3156845 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3156846 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3156847 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3156848 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3156849 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3156850 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

3156852 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3156853 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3156854 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3156855 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3156856 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3156857 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3156858 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3156859 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3156871 its very rare that an apartment that was purchased with this crystal ball price analysis turns out to be a good long term purchase
3156872 during these periods real estate agents immobiliers give the impression that inventory is limited so psychologically buyers tend to make offers recklessly
3156873 people try to do a little more than they are capable of
3156874 it generally means the system here ends up costing them more
3156875 i see it more and more they always seem angry frustrated and appear embarrassed that the situation about the
3156876 m d g f r a n c e has a neighborhood by neighborhood network throughout paris and france of agencies that work exclusively with us they know we bring them qualified buyers who are ready to purchase
3156877 in most cases when we can put out the buyers requirements size budget etc to our network in a specified area it takes just one day and we will have lined up and pre qualified ten to fifteen possible properties your typical agency just doesnt have access to that kind of information
3156878 people come here thinking about all the gains they have made somewhere else in a different system and neglect the fact that here it is completely different culture language law and market and there is a lot more to the details in navigating the process
3156879 the key to purchasing here in france is preparation and following a fairly explicit critical path to acquisition getting your requirements and needs defined early on your financing with a french financial institution if you are seeking a mortgage in place prior to your first offer and having the patience to wait until the right property is presented to you or even a property that might have been on the market for a few months its possible although most desirable apartments go reasonably fast an experienced professional would have the capability to track this for you m d g f r a n c e ensures that you are not seduced along the way

3157167 at that time antony fortuny still suspected that part of the boys mental deficiencies were due to his diet which was far too influenced by his mothers french cooking it was a well known fact that the richness of buttery foods led to moral ruin and confusion of the intellect
3157168 i felt like thats where i wanted to go i didnt feel like there was a need to drag out the process if i already knew where i wanted to be its a dream come true im very excited
3157169 with the rate of employment growth expected to remain below that of the working age population the unemployment rate is expected to rise
3157170 because we find no evidence for a major change in vegetation and or fire dynamics and because the megafauna had relatively low reproductive rates we favour the hypothesis that human hunting led to a rapid population collapse
3157171 in tasmania weve got as good evidence as anywhere that it was a very quick extinction
3157172 if humans had not arrived in australia the megafauna would still be here now thats what i believe
3157173 i think in tasmania the whole show could have been over within a thousand years or so
3157174 the broader picture is the megafauna survived all of those environmental fluctuations in tact but its the arrival of people that is the key factor
3157175 the results show that megafauna persisted in tasmania until at least 41 000 years ago which is similar to or slightly later than the time of extinction on the australian mainland
3157176 importantly that time postdates the establishment of a land bridge across the bass straight and is statistically concordant with the minimum age for the earliest evidence of humans in tasmania
3157177 the evidence that humans cause the extinction of giant ice age mammals in australia by over hunting them is now much stronger
3157178 the big picture that is now much clearer is that when people arrive other animals disappear
3157179 this is a sad and it seems almost inevitable feature of our species impact on nature
3157180 supporters of the rival theory that climate change killed off the megafauna have run out of places to hide

3157232 youve got to be careful because its gotten to the point now where i dont know how much benefit there is to having two practices in a day
3157233 wed much rather have just one really good practice with our team thats why we went light this morning and i thought we had a good practice i think it really helped us from a special teams perspective after having a day off yesterday it was probably good to get them back in the flow before we had our pad practice
3157234 weve been working so many people we have got to start thinking about developing a two deep and just working those guys
3157235 we have so many guys in right now both offensively and defensively and we dont know how many of them will actually carry into the season were really trying to get a lot in so were getting too many mental mistakes right now probably by thursday when we have our scrimmage we will pretty much decide what the two deep is and go from there to get those guys ready to play
3157236 im very fortunate to have two experienced veteran players in
3157237 theyve played a lot of football here they were both starters all last year and the year before that as redshirt freshmen they played a lot they have a lot of experience theyre savvy veterans both are bigger stronger and faster than they have ever been before im really excited about both of those kids
3157238 michaels a redshirt sophomore and he also got some experience last year as a redshirt freshman were counting on him to significantly contribute this fall hell be a key key guy for us
3157239 we have three different young men who are battling for the fourth slot in michael and ted are both older more experienced players as redshirt juniors however they havent seen a lot of game action some special teams for ted and a little bit of game time for michael they have a lot to prove and dennis is still only a redshirt freshman both ted and dennis moved from tight end well see who shines during two a days to get the most playing time out of that threesome
3157240 were hopefully going to redshirt him this season and were really excited about him he had a ton of offers and he chose to come with us hes from the pipeline that tommy elrod has developed down at nease high school in jacksonville
3157241 it seems clear weve come to a natural balancing point
3157242 we have to determine whether we hold or find a way to reach new audiences it wont be by adding shows or venues though

3157257 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3157258 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3157259 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3157260 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3157261 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3157262 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3157263 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3157264 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3157277 developed a novel method for locating and harvesting the feces in the ocean
3157278 our right whale researchers have collected hundreds of samples of whale feces since 2003 laboratory tests performed on whale poop can reveal stress levels parasites illness and whether the whale had been exposed to biotoxins associated with red tides we also run laboratory tests to determine whether a whale is sexually mature and if females are pregnant or nursing this methodology has already been replicated by non aquarium researchers working with other animals
3157279 prepare the feces in three or four different recipes and just eat it for hours
3157280 hey whats up you guys should check out my bands instrumental its really rockin

3157283 wed like to have c j help us down the stretch but he knows his elbow better than anyone else and he didnt feel he could help the club
3157284 just last week i got a call from a manager who said with gas going up id like to let my employees know that im open to more telework
3157285 i thought that was wonderful because it came from the manager now i can use that as an example for other managers
3157286 you have quality of life flexibility environmental awareness and gas prices translate that into communities where you have high numbers of federal workers and others and i think it begins to have a significant impact
3157287 you get less pollution going into the air you get less traffic and congestion
3157288 effective performance management is the same whether or not an employee teleworks
3157289 managers should measure employee performance by results not physical presence
3157290 by emphasizing managing for results and coming up with well known and agreed upon standards for performance which you need to do for telework you introduce a culture of results based management and performance standards
3157291 i think the administration has too often approached this performance based approach in a kind of heavy handed quota driven way you have to approach it differently you have to create a supportive culture inside an organization that invites people to focus more on certain performance standards
3157292 we had about 2 800 people logged on teleworking we tested our continuity of operations sites we brought up our communication links
3157293 we were able to maintain connectivity with those employees much better than we would have been able to do had we not done that one of the lessons we got out of it was we clearly have to check our networks more often and were doing that on a more than monthly basis to make sure that if people do telework they can get the access they need
3157294 we have the single largest number of users on one network we have the security advances
3157295 the government is on the leading edge theyre trying to find ways to stretch that budget further the private sector is catching up but they havent seen it as much of a productivity tool as the federal government has
3157296 i think one of the things the federal sector can continue to teach the private sector is that telework is an essential tool for a continuity of operations plans
3157297 our director obviously was the first coop critical person so he filled out a telework agreement and i was able to publicize that fact
3157298 the director has a telework agreement so you dont have to be afraid to ask for one
3157299 its really interesting where the federal government stands in terms of do people think the federal government is sexy is it appealing
3157300 federal agencies have a great opportunity to be the no 1 appealing organization to work for to show how diverse they are and how they can compete with the private sector
3157301 we expect to see improved retention rates and be viewed more favorably as an employer of choice
3157302 the literature suggests that individuals with flexible work schedules look more favorably on their employers telework is the civilized way to work in the 21st century
3157303 in 25 years of doing this work ive never seen a union waive their right to file grievances
3157304 what i would hope though is that other locals of federal labor unions who are representing federal employees wont have to make those concessions now
3157305 i hope people see that we took the risk and the result was positive so they wont have to take that risk i dont think they should be afraid of grievances over it if people arent being treated equitably management should want to know that and rectify it
3157306 i deal with the managers behind the scenes but the union is working from the employees perspective and encouraging them to apply and telling them the way the system works and what is expected
3157307 the opportunities with this telework concept are tremendous and i think multi dimensional
3157308 im very excited about it because weve got a whole set of factors coming together that are making people take a harder look
3157309 we dont know but there may have been possible maltreatment
3157310 im going to be looking into the deaths of the four children and the past practices by dcfs
3157311 id like to give them more money and more staff but im afraid itll just become a bigger ball of chaos
3157312 there is obviously a significant focus on the space coast
3157313 as you indicated both presidential candidates have been here and will be here again but its very important to this administration regardless of party that has nothing to do with what were focused on were focused on jobs

3157336 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty
3157337 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3157338 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3157339 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3157340 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3157341 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3157342 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3157343 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3157344 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3157345 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3157346 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3157347 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3157348 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests

3157412 these changes are designed to reduce the number of unnecessary consultations under the esa so that more time and resources can be devoted to the protection of the most vulnerable species
3157413 the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
3157414 draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species
3157415 as a result it is inappropriate to consult on a remote agency action involving the contribution of emissions to global warming because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3157416 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3157417 the new rules take decision making on endangered species listings out of the hands of scientists and wildlife professionals at agencies such as the u s fish and wildlife services and instead put those decisions in the hands of agencies working on projects that may be adversely affected by a listing
3157418 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3157419 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3157420 when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3157421 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3157422 ive said all along that experience while being very important i mean weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that playing well its as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic
3157423 its nice to be known for something good like that
3157424 and to be part of a winning ryder cup team thats the last memory i have of it personally so hopefully i can bring some of that into the locker room and have a positive influence on the event
3157425 hes got that kind of demeanor that you need on the ryder cup team
3157426 you need a bunch of different type of personalities for a ryder cup team to blend and ben curtis a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality hes that type of guy thats going to put his head down and barrel on
3157427 im really happy that i dont have to pick four players this morning

3157430 he liked everything from head coach travis ford to recruiting coordinator steve middleton to the academic support they have he liked the whole environment its a high major program
3157431 travis recruited him for the last two years when he was at umass and now
3157432 just having some other people there that he knew that was a big plus
3157433 if he needs to blow his own trumpet well fine
3157434 but my mother who was a simple housewife she showed me the snake when i was a child
3157435 how dare this man come in here and name a snake after his wife
3157436 it gives the impression that people here depend on people from abroad to come and show us things in our own backyard
3157437 probably people have overreacted its nationalism going a bit awry
3157438 these properties harbor criminals have substantial drug activity squatters and have dangerous conditions for our children

3157456 hay muchos medios que prestan el aire a los sectores populares o a las organizaciones comunitarias y se definen como comunicaci n popular pero creo que a eso le falta una pata porque me parece que los sectores populares no s lo tienen que estar en el aire sino tambi n en la direcci n y en la producci n de sus medios
3157457 la concientizaci n popular la hacen los sectores populares por eso la radio pasa y reivindica la cumbia villera hay quienes preguntan y hay quienes afirman que la cumbia villera nivela para abajo que es m sica de segunda pasamos cumbia villera por una cuesti n de identidad porque es la m sica que refleja lo que pasa en el barrio y en los sectores populares si no pas ramos esa m sica no ser amos ni una radio popular ser amos una radio para minor as

3157491 to our mind the efforts undertaken by this defendant to avoid conclusive identification are simply too extensive for us to take anything at face value wark said
3157492 any identification we make must be checked double checked supported and verified by every means possible those efforts remain ongoing at this hour
3157493 what it means is that were asking anybody who knew him or was associated with him between 1985 and 1988 to come forward

3157495 i think that the reason the movie works so well is because the violence is so well balanced with the comedy on my first day i got to take a blow torch to a mans genitals which was only funny when i saw it onscreen but i mean how often do you get to play something as dark as that and still make it funny so for me it was just a dream to get this job and to be able to work with this phenomenal cast

3157582 wed like to have c j help us down the stretch but he knows his elbow better than anyone else and he didnt feel he could help the club
3157583 when i used to play against him you just couldnt throw the ball in the middle of the field because he was always around it now that im playing with him its the same thing in practice
3157584 so if they need me to go over there with those guys i can
3157585 everybody always tells me you better watch your back cause ed will take your candy
3157586 ed can sneak up you we were out there today and my man was on a comeback pattern im breaking up on the ball and i see ed fly by where you come from man hes everywhere i always heard stories about how ed reed makes plays and now im out here witnessing it
3157587 its day to day right now i cant really explain it to this point because im still researching it myself
3157588 i figure it might be all right if not well deal with it then
3157589 having coached the secondary you have a good idea of the picture you look for back there
3157590 ed is good enough to change the picture just a little bit he doesnt have to be quite as deep or quite as wide or quite as tight as another guy to still be in position to make the play you see why hes made so many plays over the years by baiting quarterbacks a little bit hes got a real knack for that
3157591 he is the best free safety in the game hands down theres nobody better than him nobody roams the field better than him nobody catches the ball better in that back end

3157600 this groundbreaking decision in support of the congress right to enforce its subpoenas is a victory for our democracy
3157601 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law in fact there is supreme court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity the court therefore rejects the executives claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential aides

3157620 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city said mr bush

3157626 we are concerned that investment proposals do not match consumer priorities and believe that the work they are proposing will push prices up beyond what customers are willing to pay
3157627 thames customers have enjoyed the lowest bills in the industry for many years but we now need to make essential investment to secure their services for the future
3157628 i said we would bring a freshness to the spl and we did that
3157629 but we have to keep doing that week in week out and now we have to focus on the game at inverness who had a great win at the weekend
3157630 were in with the big boys now and we are determined to enjoy it
3157631 i thought it was an entertaining game and we were great
3157632 to go a goal down in the manner we did and to bounce back against a very good side says a lot about the players
3157633 ive said to the players enjoy it because there will be a few hits along the way
3157634 in the case of the three men you shot them with a sub machinegun as some form of execution because of a prior drug deal where you were dissatisfied none of the three were armed you lured them to the cowells residence to kill those responsible and to compensate yourself by taking a further kilo of cocaine you failed to kill ian jennings who escaped into the back garden

3157637 lost everything my job my health years of what should have been a happy retirement
3157638 i was given a misdiagnosis ive lost my lung and i lost my job for those reasons i feel that at the very least an explanation should be given to me by the grampian health board who should sit down and discuss financial compensation for my loss of earnings
3157639 i have lost everything my job my health and i have had years of what should have been a happy retirement stolen from me to say that i was shocked doesnt really do it justice i was exhilarated to have survived the operation and then to be told that i didnt have cancer
3157640 tackling knife crime is a top priority for the met with enforcement taking place across the capital every day under operation blunt 2 as a result more people are being arrested and charged for carrying knives
3157641 what came out of the meeting was a desire to make sure the festival flourishes an overwhelming vote in favour of the review process we have established
3157642 it is of sufficient importance for us to ensure that the answers we give are seen to be objective and not seen as the fringe society protecting itself if there is any fault within the society we dont want to hide that in any way we want that to be transparent
3157643 this is not about whitewashing anything but other factors have to be taken into account
3157644 hotel bookings are down this year there are fewer tourist from the states we are only a third of the way through the festival and you cant begin to measure any potential impact until after the festival
3157645 there are many factors apart from the box office which affect how a show may or may not do and it would be unrealistic to quantify these now
3157646 that test is done over and done with its part of history
3157647 nothing of that test will come back to help us or come back to haunt us on saturday
3157648 there are a lot of other things that you have to take into consideration and we did just that last week on our own and we started considering those now with the senior players and the rest of the coaching staff so we are buying into what we want to do against new zealand and i hope its going to work
3157649 i know their defensive structure is one of the best
3157650 now they have richie mccaw back and he is combining well with the other loose forwards

3157655 russias aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states
3157656 the implications go beyond their threat to a democratic georgia russia is using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbours such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west

3157688 what russia has been doing against georgia for the last two days represents an open aggression unprecedented in modern times
3157689 it is a direct challenge for the whole world if russia is not stopped today by the whole world tomorrow russian tanks might reach any european capital i think everyone has understood this by now
3157690 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
3157691 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6
3157692 saakashvili has been trying to internationalize the conflicts in georgia since he has come to office
3157693 it has been very much his strategy to make this an international conflict between the traditional west and russia speaking in language of the cold war and saying that this is really the last frontier hes been racking up those kind of expressions in the past few days but this is really nothing new
3157694 why precisely now what made saakashvili decide that this was the right moment politically in my opinion one of the reasons is that mikheil saakashvili believes the current us administration has certain obligations toward him and the next presidential administration particularly if this is a democratic administration wont feel it has any of these obligations and may modify the overall stance on georgia
3157695 i really think he saakashvili has taken it a step too far because if we were really going to push back the russians you would need something like a military intervention and that is not going to happen
3157696 russia has been trying increase its international legitimacy as a defender of international law not only in the caucasus but also weve been seeing this in the balkans as well with the positions russia has been taking on kosovo it is going to be more difficult for them to stand in front of the security council as the big defender of international law while theyre bombing civilian targets and georgian cities
3157697 if former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic should be put on trial the opinion here is so too should saakashvili
3157698 once the bombing stops i believe saakashvili will not survive
3157699 what did matter was that the new nativism was stronger and more virulent than any anti immigration forces or groups of the early nineteenth century and that these groups were determined either to drive from the shores those who were different or to isolate them so that they could not contaminate society

3157724 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3157725 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3157726 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3157727 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a government elected by its people
3157728 an immediate cease fire withdrawal of forces from the conflict zone a return to the military status quo as of aug 6 and a commitment to refrain from the use of force
3157729 russias government must reverse the course that it appears to be on as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3157730 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3157731 dogs with behavioral issues separation anxiety or who dont like other dogs are likely to experience a lot of stress if kenneled
3157732 likewise older dogs who have never experienced a kennel may not adjust well
3157733 the main thing were trying to do is keep them mentally and physically exercised we find theyre happier all around
3157734 there are no tears when the dog is left here
3157735 kids get involved in selecting which suite the dog will use and everyone feels good
3157736 in most cases i see dogs being much calmer than when theyre kenneled they know where their toys are where their dish is their yard is just a few steps away
3157737 they need to know what should be done in an emergency who the vet is what the pets habits are the favorite toys things like where theres a circuit breaker box in case of a storm
3157738 people from the city really like it because there arent a lot of places you can swim off leash with your dog
3157739 we participate at concerts weddings funerals birthdays and most any event where we are invited our music is in english or spanish and has a new twist on the latin beat we are known for harmonics and a progressive contemporary sound

3157741 i read a book about his obamas rise a poor simple black who became a senator my aim too is to get to the top the presidency
3157742 it was a marketing ploy the idea stuck it was on peoples minds
3157743 it wasnt a marketing strategy but this idea has brought a positive effect among people
3157744 the launch of best buy express is another way for best buy to provide consumers with the products they need from a brand they trust even while theyre on the go
3157745 this could cause some problems for two or three days yet
3157746 but at night i dont think theres any way for them to know where it is
3157747 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3157748 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3157749 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3157750 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
3157751 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
3157752 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
3157753 i reiterate my call for russia to stop its bombing campaign to stop flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and to withdraw its ground forces from georgia the georgian government has proposed a cease fire and the russian government should accept it there is also an urgent need for humanitarian assistance to reach the people of georgia and casualties on both sides
3157754 the united states europe and all other concerned countries must stand united in condemning this aggression and seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence this is a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia the un must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3157755 going forward the united states and europe must support the people of georgia beyond immediate humanitarian assistance we must provide economic assistance and help rebuild what has been destroyed i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and transatlantic institutions including a membership action plan for nato and we must continue to press for that deeper relationship
3157756 the relationship between russia and the west is long and complicated there have been many turning points for good and ill this is another turning point let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past

3157777 i think the strength of real discipleship is not just needingnew information but transformation that comes through relationships
3157778 they put me through some tests they wanted me to become as fit as i could to show that i was committed and i did that
3157779 they just wanted me to realize that they wanted to become winners and i think im a winner and im going to help them do that
3157780 they really wanted me to know that their pick at number two was very important to them that they were going to build their franchise around me so i really had to work as hard as i could
3157781 i knew how important it was and how much theyre putting on me to become a very good player in their organization
3157782 i love the game of hockey and ill do anything to become the best player i can be
3157783 one setback was my fitness and ive worked really hard at that im going to continue to become more and more fit and work on a lot of things on the ice i think i can do that now that ive lost the weight i feel so much quicker a lot more mobile every aspect of my skating feels a lot faster and better
3157784 i really was dreaming of this since i was a little kid right before i kind of had the gut feeling i was going to go but then i saw calgarys gm and lombardi shaking hands and i thought oh no i didnt think i was going to go there so i was a little worried
3157785 i wouldve been glad to go anywhere but just because i loved la so much when i was a little kid its just unbelievable to be here
3157786 wayne gretzky was my idol growing up not only was he my favorite player on the ice but i thought off ice he also dealt with the media very well so i just loved him growing up i just loved wayne gretzky when i was a kid and thats what made me follow the kings
3157787 i think everybody back there has a pretty good handle of what type of player he is and how special he could become but the rub was when people looked at comparisons between doughty and bogosian was zachs toughness and competitiveness i think we got that in teubert if you could put them all together it would be great i think that element was really lacking in our group
3157788 i still believe strongly in what this type of kid brings with his leadership his toughness his commitment
3157789 he has some work to do theres no doubt about it but he has a presence about him if all goes well that could be a special group back there i just think thats critical if youre ever going to win something that matters
3157790 thats why when we did the deal we had to get up into a certain area
3157791 we werent just going to trade cammalleri unless we were sure we could get this guy we set a target from eleven to thirteen this is where we had to be to ensure ourselves that we were getting him i was dealing with three or four teams i was offered some good players who couldve helped us now but they didnt fit within what were trying to do in terms of the core were trying to put together
3157792 cammalleri was a good player but it was clear that he was probably a one year asset for us going forward
3157793 it was very clear that ownership wants to get a young nucleus together that can stay together and our chances of keeping cammalleri in that nucleus didnt look very good on the heels of last years salary demands
3157794 our chances of moving him and maximizing value werent looking very good
3157795 we went through the entire market this week and prior to it and i got a pretty good handle on what the league thought of him in terms of my ability to get a return
3157796 what was clear to me was i couldnt get into where i needed to not only that teubert was the guy we really wanted there were some pretty good players in that layer but to give up cammalleri we thought we had to be in that layer hopefully with teubert being there
3157797 it was clear to me that i couldnt get in there by trading him outright
3157798 those teams thought that was too high once it was clear to me that i couldnt get in there then i tried to start working on sprucing it up so to speak by using the 28th overall pick or our second round picks in combinations when that didnt work i tried to find another partner and that was calgary
3157799 i told flames general manager darryl sutter last night that i was fine on our part that he was going to give me the 17th overall pick for cammalleri the second round pick flopping was ok with me because i want to move some picks into next year anyway but like i told him 17 is not enough for me to get what i want
3157800 i didnt feel teubert would be there i was thinking hed be gone in that 13 15 range
3157801 i had to go to all those teams picking 11 14 and say ok would you take 17 and 32
3157802 we paid a big price with the 28th overall pick but i was prepared to pay it to get a player with these elements
3157803 there was a chance that i couldve traded that pick and moved down two if i wanted to get cute thinking that teubert would fall a couple of spots it was an opportunity to move back maybe two or three spots and take a chance that my guy would be there but i wasnt too enamored with doing that but it was a thought
3157804 when buffalo called i told them i wont trade with the other team if you tell me who youre taking as long as youre not taking my guy
3157805 i dont have to take the risk you dont have to take the risk that somebody else is going to slide move into that slot so we go off to the side and im going to write down the guy im taking and you write down who youre taking if we dont match then its a third round pick in 2009 if we do nobodys at a loss for wares
3157806 i think obviously on the front end it again trended towards defensemen
3157807 i think were pretty happy with the guys we got
3157808 particularly with defenseman andrew campbell selected in the third round 74th overall after a trade with buffalo and voinov we add two more kids who are good prospects to our system
3157809 as i said yesterday the defense part of our reserve list has become stronger the key right now is to develop them as men and develop them as players if we dont do that this is not going to be a great day
3157810 i think weve taken a huge jump when you match us up now
3157811 if you look at nashvilles back end so much of what theyre building there with suter hamhuis weber they added blum last year there are some similarities where their emphasis is there and the strength of that reserve list
3157812 i just think weve taken a huge step with those four guys jack johnson thomas hickey and now doughty and teubert and dont forget that kid alec martinez
3157813 this kids going to challenge for a job too and weve got a couple of other kids in the minors and theyre not going to give up either weve got a lot to look forward to and get some players out of there
3157814 i think we finally got something we really liked and were pretty happy back here
3157815 i got pressure put on me by my owner who said i want the best kings draft in history lombardi explained
3157816 so i went back and looked at the history and i think the best draft was larry murphy bernie nicholls daryl evans and jim fox that was the pressure put on to try and beat that
3157817 unfortunately the kings traded larry murphy a year later so that didnt work out

3158042 shes worried youre going to pull something to hurt her pops so she wanted me to find out what it was
3158043 i dont have an appointment but if youre busy i could come back another time
3158044 i suppose youre wondering why im here to tell you the truth im not really sure myself but id heard you were the man for finding out things that people want under the rug and i cant go to the cops
3158045 pietro doesnt seem to be taking it too well see and hes been making threats against my father round town him and his brother theyre planning something big something thats going to cause a lot of grief for the people of this town not just daddy or me i dont know just what it is so i came here hoping
3158046 seems to me your father could use that information better than me goldie
3158047 i cant tell daddy about this or hell just have pietro killed and i cant be a part of that i just cant
3158048 i was thinking if you could find something solid on what theyre up to you could pass it on to the cops downtown and just leave my name from the write up that way daddy is safe and pietro gets whats coming to him plus youd get a civil commendation im sure
3158049 so you want me to sniff around the mob find out about some big job theyre planning pass on any leads to the cops and walk away with a commendation and a target on my back if your father doesnt know about this i dont see you paying what that would cost with just your allowance
3158050 i have my means mr bennet perhaps this could help settle the final account
3158051 then ill leave this in your capable hands if you need money for expenses you can leave a card with my doorman im sure you can find the address on your own time
3158052 at the rate you wind that watch time will never run out
3158053 as am i although id enjoy it considerably more if our esteemed landlady would get around to fixing my windows i cant close them for the life of me my rooms are starting to feel like a cold store by the time i wake up and its slowing down the development of my agar cultures considerably
3158054 you know you are welcome to use my rooms for your experiments doctor ive yet to become accustomed to the noise at night so ive painted the windows shut the temperature should be more consistent if that is agreeable to you
3158055 party tonight at the corinthian need someone to take the socials other guys sick be there 7 sharp and dress like you know how would you
3158056 so break em less you dont need the money anymore
3158057 jaysis mary and joseph dooya have any idea what toime it is now
3158058 not all of us are in bed by sundown parkman
3158059 bennet me boy well not all of you are at work before sunrise to what do i owe the pleasure
3158060 since youre up anyways mickey i was hoping to get your help with something
3158061 russias end game is to reassert its sphere of influence
3158062 medvedevs personnel resource is extraordinarily limited for now he can count on a small group of officials with whom he had worked in the government previously but in the main he is surrounded by putinite cadres
3158063 let the west denigrate our military let them call us retrograde
3158064 as the world turns these are the days of our lives
3158065 the typical damage in this instance would be cracked interior or plaster or drywall glass and potentially even contents that are damaged as a result of shifting
3158066 its the impact of the explosion and then the resulting damage that comes from the impact
3158067 theres also the question of how much of the damage was insured apparently there are quite a few renters in the neighbourhood and many of them did not have tenants insurance
3158068 for as long as you cant operate and youre not making the money that you would normally make theres insurance coverage for that
3158069 its too late after the event to adjust your coverage to cover that sort of thing but the main thing is to get the claim in and hear what your personal situation is from your insurance company
3158070 in the meantime youve got to look after yourself as if you were not insured and youve got to make sure that any damages are mitigated by any actions you can take
3158071 what we are seeing are youngsters a community that is in revolt because they dont like the way they are being treated
3158072 i think the biggest problem is not the young people its squarely the police
3158073 i think its important we have this sentiment of security and the only way we can have it is by being very transparent in the investigation that will be put forward by the minister of public security
3158074 i was very clear with him this morning that this has to be done as soon as possible and the information will be made public
3158075 were there to listen to understand what happened yesterday sunday night and to avoid these kinds of situations
3158076 if they dont change their tactics they run risk of instigating a significant rupture with the community
3158077 the youngsters of the neighbourhood will feel under surveillance more so than they already are
3158078 i feel very upset and im not going to tolerate what happened on the weekend
3158079 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
3158080 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit more
3158081 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3158082 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3158083 this committee as envisioned was to provide parliamentary and independent advice to the prime minister
3158084 if its cabinet people on it the suspicion has to be that theyre not there providing independent advice theyre just there as mouthpieces for the prime ministers office
3158085 we have to respect the separation between judicial power and the government
3158086 i hope the government will realize they made a terrible mistake
3158087 ultimately the appointment of a supreme court justice is a function of the executive
3158088 weve put this process in place and we have the right to name some individuals were not providing a veto to the bloc or the ndp on these things
3158089 its hard to put that kind of race behind you but it sets me up for something good tomorrow
3158090 butterflies going my hands are sweating my heart is pounding but i try to look very calm on the outside
3158091 the feeling it gave us was an older brother who was lighting the flame
3158092 it was very exciting and moreover it was on our home soil
3158093 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3158094 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3158095 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3158096 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3158097 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3158098 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3158099 this committee as envisioned was to provide parliamentary and independent advice to the prime minister
3158100 if its cabinet people on it the suspicion has to be that theyre not there providing independent advice theyre just there as mouthpieces for the prime ministers office
3158101 we have to respect the separation between judicial power and the government
3158102 i hope the government will realize they made a terrible mistake
3158103 ultimately the appointment of a supreme court justice is a function of the executive
3158104 weve put this process in place and we have the right to name some individuals were not providing a veto to the bloc or the ndp on these things
3158105 it is rare for an opera to include a string quartet and choir one of our goals for the performance is to redefine what opera is
3158106 as soon as i read some of the words it went right to my creative mind
3158107 i realized that i could never make a work of art without words
3158108 her language is parallel to music because you can have so much complexity in just one word
3158109 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3158110 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3158111 it is wonderful to bring an expert of franks caliber to event innovation
3158112 in an organization with so many divergent demands its critical that we place the most knowledgeable experienced and capable individuals possible in charge of our divisions and when it comes to business development frank has a unique capability to apply his past experience to event innovations cutting edge technologies
3158113 kent is exactly the right person for event innovation bringing a wealth of commerce implementation experience to the sports and entertainment industry
3158114 kents ability to manage successful implementations of similar technologies within organizations directly applies to the success of event innovations customer base and we are excited to add him to the team
3158115 this project has been a chance for many of us to discover how amazingly true barack obamas concept of how we are the people we need is at this fiercely urgent moment at our generations now as our country and world has endured huge struggles and missteps in our recent history this dedicated group of supporters has climbed onto the platform obama has constructed to unify us all and are taking the message to heart by teaming up and using our strengths to leap toward solutions that make a difference to citizens now
3158116 we want our music to help amplify the struggles faced by katrina victims from one of our countrys largest disasters raise money for their efforts to rebuild and help show the power of obamas message when enthusiastically and diligently executed

3158127 normally people shoplift medications for their children in the winter when they are out of work now theyre doing it in the summertime its unprecedented
3158128 our politicians are out there making decisions but they dont come here to see the impact
3158129 our politicians are out there making decisions but they dont come here to see the impact
3158130 it would help people earn a bit more money by taking odd jobs and still keep their benefits
3158131 providing people with more incentives to work is important because it keeps money circulating in the community
3158132 is there a field of actors formal organizations and or networks who are trying to mobilize people for collective action to challenge and change social political and economic inequalities of course sometimes they work in coalitions and sometimes they work independently do they always work together harmoniously with a common strategy of course not but that doesnt make them less of a progressive movement
3158133 but i would agree that there are movement elements within progressive politics today
3158134 still while referring to a progressive movement does give people a feeling of being part of something bigger its important that progressives have a sense of our own history and that we not throw around the term movement too loosely
3158135 i do feel connected to people and organizations that are working on particular issues on a local state or national level but that feels very different than being part of an overarching national movement
3158136 its a wish more than an accomplished fact to say that there is a single progressive movement there are movements plural some moving more vigorously than others insofar as there is a single movement its a reaction to the depredations of the bush years
3158137 the most important thing you need to do is to have big chunks of time during the day when all youre doing is thinking
3158138 the truth is that weve got a bunch of smart people i think who know 10 times more than we do about the specifics of the topics
3158139 and so if what youre trying to do is micromanage and solve everything then you end up being a dilettante but you have to have enough knowledge to make good judgments about the choices that are presented to you

3158143 we were conscious that whilst we would rather be more specific this is at a point in time when the audit review has not yet completed
3158144 we havent gone through the audit risk management committee with this but recognising our disclosure obligations it was incumbent on us to put it out as soon as possible

3158163 then go to his interaction editor add an interaction under the appropriate event and add the script there
3158164 the usual menu buttons well the easiest way to do it if you want non interactive buttons is to draw them as part of the starting rooms usually

3158174 original content there are few online places doing original reporting this is our opportunity to seize
3158175 one of the best things about the new media is that its not a zero sum game the more sites there are offering smart compelling content the more people will get their news opinion and entertainment online
3158176 were very excited about the opportunity that the web has presented us at a time when newspapers are struggling

3158204 has a remarkable number of ties some previously unreported to republicans generally and john mccains campaign specifically and it has run attack ads against barack obama
3158205 its sic essential for the american people to know the facts about what is happening in iraq some media outlets and certain politicians still fail to assess the situation objectively so vets for freedom is heading back to iraq to let them know what has been accomplished what still needs to be done and how we should proceed in order to attain sustainable security in iraq
3158206 if essentially you have reporters who are the founders and the activists in the organization then getting credentialed and going with preconceptions and then going out and campaigning thats highly questionable and that deserves scrutiny it seems to me that to some extent the question is is there any chance that any of them change their views or is it simply a kind of a fraud

3158234 durante dos a os estudiamos todos los casos de ni os que hab an ingresado al servicio de pediatr a por intento de suicidio lo que complementamos con un grupo de ni os control observamos que el 88 por ciento de los casos correspond a a ni as con un promedio de edad de 13 1 a os
3158235 un c ctel de medicamentos lo que encontraron en la casa y en este punto hay que estar atentos a dos cosas primero la necesidad de que los adultos tomen conciencia de la importancia del manejo seguro de los f rmacos en las casas de modo que no queden al alcance de los ni os segundo que cuando un ni o diga que se va a tomar un medicamento porque quiere matarse no hay que deso r esa advertencia no se puede descalificar porque sea un ni o
3158236 la sociedad tiene que preocuparse tenemos que hacernos cargo de nuestros ni os y de nuestros adolescentes antes de que los ni os sean dados de alta nosotros tomamos contacto con los equipos de salud mental de los consultorios se pide un estudio social un informe social y si hay alguien que est m s capacitado para acoger al ni o lo sugerimos
3158237 escrib un art culo respecto de un ni o que estuvo esposado aqu en el servicio un ni o delincuente fue un caso realmente impactante hubo colegas que se acercaron a comentar esta situaci n inclusive un sacerdote me dijo que hab a le do el art culo y se preguntaba lo mismo que yo qu esta pasando con los ni os con los adolescentes hay un serio problema de violencia y delincuencia
3158238 la situaci n es m s grave si agregamos este aumento de los intentos de suicidio esto lleva a pensar que el ni o o el adolescente se ve sometido a un ambiente tan opresivo que no tiene otra forma de reaccionar que intentando suicidarse ya sea porque realmente quiere matarse o porque busca llamar la atenci n porque tiene problemas no resueltos la conclusi n para m es clara la sociedad chilena tiene que tener alg n grado de preocupaci n mayor respecto a la protecci n de los adolescentes creo que hay un problema de la sociedad y tambi n de la familia uno ve la desintegraci n de la familia aqu todos los d as vemos casos de hogares mal constituidos de ausencia de la figura paterna en forma muy importante y son las mujeres las madres o las abuelas las que se hacen cargo de los ni os se requiere mayor preocupaci n de la sociedad

3158594 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government he said
3158595 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city said mr bush

3158602 id read that flaxseed oil helped so i started giving him a couple of drops
3158603 ive been very successful at getting my product on the shelf
3158604 if im doing a demonstration they love the taste and buy it but when im not there to say buy it for all of these great reasons it doesnt move
3158605 but the average consumer doesnt realize that refined oil is as bad as refined sugar
3158606 i need advice on effective ways to create buzz around a product without a lot of money
3158607 so she needs to find other things people can do with this product
3158608 nothing stands out the most important words are certified organic and unrefined but if youre in her target demographic a 40 year old female youre not going to see that without putting your glasses on
3158609 thatll give her a place to also share her story and she can include recipes and explain the product too
3158610 i believe her that its better for me but its something that needs to be better explained
3158611 its not just about promoting the product its also about promoting herself
3158612 a good way to do that is to set herself up as an authority to the media
3158613 what would be best for her is to send a sample with a handwritten note as opposed to a big press release
3158614 all she needs is a couple of champions out there who believe in what shes doing
3158615 how can you write about a product if you havent tasted it
3158616 the home page is filled with a bunch of bottles that you cant click on
3158617 the customer wants to get what they can see and if they cant they get very frustrated

3158644 there is no such thing as credit repair its a scam
3158645 no one can legally remove accurate and timely negative information from a credit report
3158646 more on the idea that disputing bad credit is like pleading not guilty
3158647 every derogatory credit item on your credit history will be disputed from all three major credit bureaus
3158648 send dispute letters to the credit bureaus disputing the debts that you owe
3158649 everything a credit repair clinic can do for you you can do for yourself
3158650 below are the results of your request for equifax to reinvestigate certain elements of your equifax credit file
3158651 out clauses and escape routes deliberately engineered to help out only a select few privileged enough to know about them
3158652 you get 10 000 if i fail to eliminate your debts or repair or enhance or improve your credit or fico score
3158653 a lot of my affiliates have outdated versions of my website
3158654 in no way shape or form are we saying we can remove accurate information
3158655 we have an updated application which defines our guarantee clearly
3158656 we also give full disclosure of client rights on the first page of the application to the exact website you have posted on your blog
3158657 this is payment in full and services will be rendered until file is completely finished you have a 3 day right to cancel services with no penalty for a full refund application with instructions will be available immediately after payment
3158658 the laws that you say we are breaking only apply to actual credit repair agencies on paper
3158659 credit repair organization means any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails to sell provide or perform or represent that such person can or will sell provide or perform any service in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration for the express or implied purpose of i improving any consumers credit record credit history or credit rating or ii providing advice or assistance to any consumer with regard to any activity or service described in clause i
3158660 requiring advance payment for credit repair services and misrepresenting the credit repair services that would be performed
3158661 oh you should probably go with him because we cant do what he does
3158662 but then it is stated in the comment above that when your client was talking to lexington law the client was able to give the representative your partners name how was this possible
3158663 lexington law actually found out who my partner was and wanted to use us to do all their credit repair
3158664 i understand you are attacking the marketing aspect of this but there is one thing you have to remember the ftc nor the credit bureaus want you to do credit repair at all this hurts them so they have many scare tactics to try and keep as many people from doing credit repair as possible
3158665 we realize we are disobeying the law when it comes to our marketing but our excuse is that we have a good reason for doing so
3158666 second if you really look at those laws you claim to know so well you will see that some of that information only applies to certain states every state has different laws on credit repair
3158667 i do the best i can to deliver accurate information to all my affiliates but it is their job to publish it also the internet exempts them from individual state laws

3158670 in a few months you will have realized you have wasted your time and money
3158671 my package works i guarantee it i dont know what else to tell you
3158672 he said i couldnt breast feed because breast milk is a bodily fluid and i could contaminate the park and he would have to shut the park down
3158673 i dont think anyone should have to feel bad or gross about giving their child the best nourishment i was no threat
3158674 he basically told me if i didnt leave the park he would close it down
3158675 when other women wanted to know why he had shut down the park he told them to go ask me
3158676 people should not be harrassed they should be patted on the back for breast feeding
3158677 first let me says the city has no plans to limit breast feeding and we encourage it this has been the only incident at a city park and it was simply a misinterpretation by staff
3158678 seeing a woman breast feeding in public is not the same thing as seeing a scantily clad woman at the beach its a woman nourishing her child the best way she can
3158679 russias actions this week raise serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3158680 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia

3158682 it is time for russia to be true to its word and act to end this crisis

3158700 for me models are just pieces of wood that i carve to make clothes look beautiful
3158701 mtv asked me to do another season but i dont want to do that right now im going to do something else with my life its time to move on
3158702 everyone was going wild tila was downing effen vodka shots all night and hanging all over courtenay tila was totally into her and was dirty dancing with her but everyone was still asking where casey was
3158703 id seen the show and just needed to meet her and it just happened
3158704 it would therefore be of considerable public health importance if these medications substantially influenced a common disease
3158705 the beneficial effects may far outweigh the risks associated with fractures
3158706 i would bet there are many people who are taking them continuously because they had some mild heartburn they had relief and they just continued to take them
3158707 i think we have to be much more cautious about using them now
3158708 get on them if you need them get off them as soon as possible
3158709 these are good drugs i would hate to tell people not to use them if they need them and if their physician really feels they need them
3158710 they should be careful and they should know this is one of the potential side effects
3158711 if you have a good reason for being on these medications and many people do i would not recommend stopping this on the basis of the strength of the data right now
3158712 but there is a great number of people who use these medications regularly who likely dont need to use them
3158713 its a trigger for you to go to your doctor and say is there a good reason for me to still be taking this
3158714 isnt a condition that takes place over days or months or even years it takes place over a lifetime
3158715 it makes more sense to me that it would be more of a long term effect
3158716 these negative statistics combine with several others including the loss of 55 200 jobs casting a further pall over canadas economy
3158717 as most of the bad news regarding the u s economy has already been digested by the financial markets stock indexes are showing signs of bouncing back
3158718 the expected slowdown of the other g 7 economies combined with capital inflows towards u s financial assets will support the greenback in the quarters ahead this should translate into a further appreciation of the u s dollar
3158719 this report was fairly ugly and adds to the growing body of evidence pointing to the cooling in the canadian housing sector
3158720 however despite the recent slowdown and the moderation in activity it is in no way comparable to the prolonged correction that we have been seeing in the u s
3158721 in the spring budget season the western provinces buffered by high commodity prices sported the largest surpluses while central canada walked a tight rope to keep their bottom lines in the black
3158722 with much of this change the result of stumbling manufacturing and export sectors our forecasts for ontario and quebec already on the bearish side absorbed the brunt of the downgrade
3158723 we made the decision to go with one name so that its a consistent experience for customers

3158726 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3158727 the goal of this operation is regime change in georgia
3158728 we have to go to the shelter because there are russian planes flying over the presidential palace here sorry
3158729 it is clear that russias current leadership is bent on restoring a neocolonial form of control over the entire space once governed by moscow
3158730 while we appealed to residents of abkhazia and south ossetia with our vision of a common future moscow increasingly took control of the separatist regimes
3158731 the kremlin even appointed russian security officers to arm and administer the self styled separatist governments
3158732 our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is
3158733 if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously
3158734 o rganisation remains decisive the forms of organising are changing and are becoming potentially more democratic but the need has grown as organic loyalties of place and class decline

3158739 while we made several changes to the overall contest the main purpose remained the same to give our customers a marketing tool hopefully helping them bring more sessions in during the slower times of year based on the high number of entries we believe many of our customers were able to accomplish that
3158740 as the world turns these are the days of our lives
3158741 corrections officers can monitor exactly the whereabouts of an offender at any given moment these are very precise satellite driven devices
3158742 it makes the job of the correctional officer more efficient
3158743 the evidence is that they work unreliably that the technology is not proven and that there are dropout zones where the technology fails
3158744 its the electronic quick fix but so far there have not been a sufficient number of analyses to determine what benefits fall out from this technology
3158745 this type of gimmickry takes away from proven reliable human interventions that are actually evidence based

3158747 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3158748 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3158749 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3158750 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3158751 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3158752 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3158753 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3158754 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3158755 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3158756 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3158757 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3158758 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3158759 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3158760 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3158761 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3158762 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3158763 the offer of repayable investment from northern ireland and uk government departments is subject to eu approval and we are confident it is fully compliant with eu and international requirements
3158764 the united states has long expressed concerns about government financial support for the launch of commercial aircraft and has pursued this issue with the europeans in the wto world trade organization
3158765 washington will take a very careful look at the support announced by canada quebec and the u k to ensure they do not distort the market for commercial airliners or contravene wto rules
3158766 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3158767 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3158768 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3158769 some things should just be left well enough alone and that film is close to perfect the way it is
3158770 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3158771 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3158772 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3158773 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3158774 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3158775 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3158776 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3158777 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3158778 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3158779 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3158780 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3158781 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

3158783 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

3158785 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3158786 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3158787 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3158788 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3158789 it turns out that no olympic event that nbc promotes as being live in prime time is shown live in the mountain and pacific time zones as they are in any other tv series
3158790 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3158791 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3158792 all the languages of heteroglossia are specific points of view on the world forms for conceptualizing the world in words specificworldviews each characterized by its own objects meanings and values bakhtin
3158793 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3158794 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3158795 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3158808 its my job to hold lenders accountable and work out a resolution between them and the borrower
3158809 the most important thing is that people get the help they can call us or just drop in and well get the process started
3158810 we differ from other organizations in that someone can see me for housing counseling then i can walk them down the hall to job placement and get the ball rolling on increasing income so they can make their house payment
3158811 we want to make sure the solution is long term and the money will go a long way

3158827 i think it is outrageous that people give him a pass as they gave george w bush a pass
3158828 he has never failed to cast his vote in favor of whatever abortion restrictions are arguably permitted under
3158829 planned parenthood and naral pro choice america consistently award him ratings of absolute zero on their scorecards
3158830 i just cant do i cant accept something that i do not deserve
3158831 it was the strongest public assertion yet that iraq is demanding a timeline
3158832 iraqs leaders have become more confident of their ability to provide security as the country has become safer but attacks which killed at least 15 people on sunday including a u s soldier were a reminder it is still a violent place
3158833 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
3158834 like the balkans in the 1990s the central problems of this region are about the dark politics of ethnic revival and territorial struggle the region is home to scores of brewing border disputes and dreams of nationalist homelands
3158835 isolation in the international community though one would hope that other russian leaders including its business elite will have cooler heads and be more aware of russias own vulnerabilities
3158836 russia controls so much of the oil and natural gas in the region already

3158856 this woman in question has a very interesting history knowing her as this kind of bar fly who had this kind of crazy past from reading everything i read it seemed to me that she targeted edwards
3158857 your impressions of this woman rielle hunter whos being trashed in new york papers today on the cover of this one it says rielle cruel saying that she trashed elizabeth edwards said she was a woman who had bad karma what can you tell us about her
3158858 why do politicians like john edwards risk their careers by having extramarital affairs
3158859 what was the trigger so i wonder if there was something about his wifes illness that somehow got him to cheat or contributed at least
3158860 well you know i think that we get so caught up in good or bad you know is somebody a good person or a bad person cheating is wrong but i think that there are multiple factors was he doing it because he had a fear of losing his wife i mean there are lots of different reasons
3158861 no i hear that there may be legitimacy to that
3158862 your impressions of this woman rielle hunter whos being trashed in new york papers today on the cover of this one it says rielle cruel saying that she trashed elizabeth edwards said she was a woman who had bad karma what can you tell us about her
3158863 why do politicians like john edwards risk their careers by having extramarital affairs
3158864 what was the trigger so i wonder if there was something about his wifes illness that somehow got him to cheat or contributed at least
3158865 well you know i think that we get so caught up in good or bad you know is somebody a good person or a bad person cheating is wrong but i think that there are multiple factors was he doing it because he had a fear of losing his wife i mean there are lots of different reasons
3158866 no i hear that there may be legitimacy to that
3158867 well that could certainly be and there are many politicians who are targeted theyre powerful sometimes theyre good looking so they are going to be in a situation that other quote unquote normal men may not be in
3158868 whats going on in his brain he has everything at risk hes running for president again theres no question about that as this is going on as his wife is suffering from this horrible disease he decides well its okay
3158869 its possible he couldnt stop himself in the sense you know the career of politics involves all sorts of change variety novelty risk uncertainty they tend to be natural rule breakers these the folks who go in there you know if they followed the strict rules theyd have a 9 00 to 5 00 ordinary job
3158870 elizabeth edwards has been amazing she said im sticking with this guy this is you know part of what life is about
3158871 i mean a lot of these women must know that their men are going to be targeted and maybe they make a decision listen my relationship is more important than some woman im not going to allow some fling to interfere with my relationship and also its a business relationship for a lot of these people in addition to being an emotional relationship
3158872 politicians arent like the rest of us you understand and neither are their spouses and so theyre attracted to certain things in these guys and sometimes there are consequences
3158873 portrays shasta oneil a sexy high school senior who flirts with the author mark polish henry mccarthy and invites him to the prom
3158874 traditional revenue sources will not be sufficient to fund games development if you look at the very narrow definition of the gaming market people are saying the software business will be down 20 percent by 2011 versus this year something is going to have to be there to make up the difference and take us beyond that threshold
3158875 my guess and analysis shows that less than three out of ten games recover their development and marketing costs with boxed good sales
3158876 so whats going to have to happen creative use of hybrid online and offline advertising revenues online and offline transactions with consumers these business models must be explored
3158877 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3158878 organizers of the beijing olympics have set up a sex determination laboratory to evaluate
3158879 women were asked to parade nude before a panel of doctors to verify their sex
3158880 i love you more than the sun the moon and all the stars
3158881 yes we had some luck here but this is just the beginning
3158882 having luck on one side doesnt mean anything if you have no luck on the other side so well go to moscow now and see
3158883 i came here to this church to pray because i really believe that god can save us
3158884 it would be unfair to consumers with accounts at other firms as well as to the firms that settled if our investigation were to slow down or stop
3158885 we are meeting with regulators in missouri and look forward to the discussions
3158886 we are cooperating with all regulatory inquiries we have received
3158887 we have been and continue to cooperate fully with the regulators and have been working with clients since february to provide liquidity on a case by case basis
3158888 getting investors their money back will continue to be a focus of the enforcement divisions investigative efforts
3158889 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3158890 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3158891 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3158892 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3158893 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3158894 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3158895 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3158896 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3158897 every time oil falls stocks rise at the moment but oil is not going to keep going down every day with all that is going on geopolitically

3158902 its a good sign for especially with somewhere between 6 and 8 million iphones out there at this point its about 10 apps per phone

3158904 once migrants grow older they go back home and more migrants come in this factor will help the city keep growing

3158918 millions of dollars are tossed around by government officials trying to buy favorable coverage a situation made worse by low salaries and lack of job security for many journalists

3158921 without an independent press no country can enjoy the benefits of a vibrant democracy yet too many governments in latin america tend to treat the media like a newsletter

3158929 i think that royalist supporters have lost confidence in funcinpec because the party is too close to the cpp
3158930 there is no space for you in our alliance and dont try to bargain for a power sharing coalition government
3158931 we do not want to see funcinpec breaking up but they were wrong in selecting their political strategy during the campaign period
3158932 the question is not whether the monarchy continues to be relevant but whether the political parties that claim they are royalist continue to be relevant
3158933 i dont believe that the people of cambodia do not support the monarchy and royalism as a political philosophy rather i believe the people lack confidence in the leaders of the so called royalist parties
3158934 the biggest mistake the royalists made was to use the monarchy to lead their movements the decline of the royalist parties is linked to the birth of the new regime
3158935 the reason that funcinpec won in 1993 was personality recognition and name recognition when former funcinpec president prince norodom ranariddh was campaigning in siem reap we didnt allow him to use sihanouk on his banners but he was still wearing a t shirt with sihanouks face
3158936 name recognition is one thing but effective campaigning is another the way i see it this election will be the end of funcinpec
3158937 the royalist parties failed because the election was not free and fair according to international standards
3158938 the national election committee nec has set the system up to benefit the cpp by confusing voters and removing their names from polling stations

3158951 there may remain only one medical facility in the state that continues to provide full scope of gender reassignment services
3158952 there are equally compelling arguments indicating that gender reassignment involving the ablation of normal organs for which there is no medical necessity because of underlying disease or pathology in the organ remains an experimental treatment associated with serious complications
3158953 there are serious questions about the long term safety of administering testosterone at therapeutic levels required for the remainder of the life of the person who undergoes gender reassignment
3158954 plaintiff does not assert membership in any suspect classification or that the denial of medicaid reimbursement for gender reassignment surgeries implicates a fundamental right
3158955 the state agencys assessment of public comment on the proposed regulation explained succinctly the reasons for denying reimbursement of gender reassignment surgeries and associated treatments it cited serious complications from the surgeries and danger from life long administration of estrogen this provided a more than sufficient rational basis which was related to legitimate government interests the health of its citizens and the conservation of limited medical resources
3158956 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks

3158990 we remain of the view that asset quality will be the key driver of bank relative performance in the current environment they said
3158991 we therefore still view westpac as undervalued versus its lower risk business mix enhanced by the st george merger and strong momentum
3158992 we maintain our buy on westpac and given our view that there is only a low risk of the merger not going ahead believe investors can also get access to westpacs share price upside through buying st george
3158993 el lanzamiento de un nuevo autom vil significa apostar a un modelo econ mico y de crecimiento virtuoso frente a otro momento que vivimos los argentinos en el que no se evidenci la creaci n de trabajo

3158995 si tuviera que definir lo que significa una planta automotriz dir a dos cosas valor agregado y trabajo para los argentinos pero adem s trabajo de alt sima calidad

3159004 his cullens eyebrows were raised by the fact the council could tap into 17m for a property developer but could not see clear to find money for housing tenants
3159005 he asked how could they find that money when they could not find money for housing it was a very good question that i knew he would ask
3159006 i am hoping cullen will listen and understand our position from the point of view of the residents rather than the council if i was asking for money for the council i know what the answer would be
3159007 i have never known a time when there has been less communication from council than there is now it is amazing we might be able to help if someone told us what is going on
3159008 i think it was pretty stunning they could find that amount of money with what seemed like urgency for a deal that gives dave henderson first refusal for buy back
3159009 it feels like a bailout for henderson rather than a way of protecting the development vision of the council
3159010 i would have thought there were better ways like city plans and bylaws to control development
3159011 there is an enormous question mark over the validity of the council entering into an agreement like this

3159016 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3159017 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3159018 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3159019 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3159020 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3159021 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3159022 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3159023 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3159024 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3159025 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3159026 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3159027 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3159028 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3159040 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3159041 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3159042 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3159043 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3159044 it is the trademark owners burden to police its mark
3159045 we believe that legal errors were made in this decision and we have every reason to believe that the circuit court will look at them afresh and hopefully agree with us
3159046 if one were a flea market operator and you become aware that counterfeiting is going on with the individual sellers at the flea market you have a duty to investigate it
3159047 the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3159048 once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3159049 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting the best way to stop counterfeiting is ongoing collaboration between companies government agencies and law enforcement
3159050 in the event that the foreign courts uphold those rulings ebays going to have to change the way it does business
3159051 if they have the ability to prevent counterfeiting in france and germany then clearly they have the ability to prevent it in the united states
3159052 there are other online sites that have to realize that theyve got to up their game and do at least what ebay is doing if they want to insulate themselves from liability

3159112 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3159113 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3159114 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3159115 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences

3159118 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3159119 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other disorders we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly
3159120 we wanted to know if we could blame this on ras protein activity so we generated new mice with normal levels of neurofibromin expression but increased levels of ras activation in brain stem cells
3159121 what weve learned also may help us gain insight into other disease processes
3159122 there are a number of other rare genetic abnormalities that cause short stature and this same pathway may be involved

3159152 the oil supplier confirmed this by doing a conductivity test testing the conductivity of an oil has absolutely nothing to do with the condition of the oil or in determining the future service life of the oil our company sent the samples to an independent oil analysis company and all the samples were considered fit for use for the next 12 months the cost to the customer to replace this oil would have been r70 041 for twelve gearboxes
3159153 we provided the customer with an alternative which was placed on trial on one machine for six months two years ago
3159154 the customer has now been operating the machinery for one and a half years successfully using our suggested alternative grease at a cost of r71 per kilogram the customer was using 36 kilograms per month which over the past eighteen months has resulted in a saving of more than r400 000

3159157 the lack of readily available ships finance for local vessels is a matter for concern foreign and local banks and financial institutions are reluctant to offer finance to south african ships this is because while they are accustomed to being preferred creditors in respect of fixed property such as houses over which they register a mortgage currently south african maritime law relegates banks behind several other categories of creditors in respect of a ship for example ship repairers and suppliers of goods and services to ships are accorded preferred creditor status which means those claims would be settled ahead of a banks claim
3159158 globally the competition to draw ships to register with a specific country is fierce as the economic spin offs are lucrative

3159213 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3159214 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3159215 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3159216 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3159217 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3159218 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3159219 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3159220 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3159230 as the ceremony got under way with a dramatic drummed countdown viewers watching at home and on giant screens inside the birds nest national stadium watched as a series of giant footprints outlined in fireworks processed gloriously above the city from tiananmen square
3159231 what they did not realize was that what they were watching was in fact computer graphics meticulously created over a period of months and inserted into the coverage electronically at exactly the right moment
3159232 as a result only the last footprint visible from the camera stands inside the birds nest was captured on film
3159233 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3159234 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3159235 it would have been prohibitive to have tried to film it live
3159236 we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route
3159237 although the event as a whole received rapturous reviews abroad that has not been entirely the case at home some internet comments were hostile saying that while it looked stunning the contents were vacuous

3159255 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3159256 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3159257 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3159258 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3159259 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3159260 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3159261 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3159262 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff

3159272 today retailers are keen on keeping inventories as low as possible to limit their financial liability but they require instant availability to stock
3159273 in an age where customers expect to be able to purchase what they want and from where they want it is vital for retailers to place the right product at the right price in the right place at the right time
3159274 we have designed these solutions to be as robust reliable and scalable as possible and at all times we ensure our pricing remains competitive we continually develop our tools to support new industry direction and growth and we work with our clients to create technology to support their business needs

3159288 certification is the most effective tool available for assuring that our forests remain healthy and productive for generations to come
3159289 group certification programs like the one administered by tcnf not only promote responsible forestry practices but also help make the certification process more accessible and affordable to landowners
3159290 opportunities to meet directly with landowners educate them about certification and walk them through enrollment in the group process are critical to our ability to increase the number of fsc certified acres here in the northeast
3159291 by enabling us to increase the trusts capacity the verso grant will allow us to significantly increase those opportunities
3159292 the program has traditionally enrolled family forestlands ranging up to about 2 500 acres
3159293 in addition to those smaller forests were encouraging the tcnf to certify larger parcels under the group umbrella
3159294 well be working closely with the wood procurement professionals at verso and other paper and forest products companies to help identify landowners who might want to enroll in the fsc group certification program
3159295 of course interested landowners can contact the trust directly by calling 207 688 8195

3159315 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3159316 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other disorders we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly
3159317 we wanted to know if we could blame this on ras protein activity so we generated new mice with normal levels of neurofibromin expression but increased levels of ras activation in brain stem cells
3159318 what weve learned also may help us gain insight into other disease processes
3159319 there are a number of other rare genetic abnormalities that cause short stature and this same pathway may be involved

3159321 rap music was a government ploy to convince black people to kill each other and keep them in the ghetto
3159322 by the second full week of the conference i and many other bishops had come to the view that the programme as a whole was designed to ensure that the conference should not seek to offer any clear guidance or teaching on any issue because of the potentially divisive effects of our starting upon the plenary debates and the voting which alone would enable the conference to articulate a particular view comparable to that of lambeth 1998
3159323 i described this apparently likely outcomes living down to the concerns about

3159344 i was rather surprised in terms of some of the numbers that datacenters were using in terms of energy
3159345 all of this requires us to take a new approach
3159346 i really think where we are headed is to create true architectures for our datacenters
3159347 weve been virtualizing on the mainframe for 35 years were just talking about bringing that out into all the other environments as well
3159348 its not like theres a silver bullet the issue in implementing virtualization is doing the end to end architectural thinking around soa
3159349 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on
3159350 but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3159351 they would come talk to us given our ability to tax efficient transaction for both parties we have good dialogue with them

3159361 i understand its bittersweet helping them this is only a minute detail compared to what theyre going through im an optimistic person but i know they struggle
3159362 either you hit traffic or something holds you up but i didnt want it to interrupt this
3159363 i want to try to get some more stuff going maybe come back here and make it an annual event
3159364 shes one of the most special young women ive ever known
3159365 like knowing when youre in love you just know it when you feel even at the expense of logic
3159366 well you can speak to the organizers but theyre threatening to send the team back home permanently disqualified from playing chess in california
3159367 maam you only deregulated the rules for cheating if you allowed the teams to play chess under a full deregulation you would not have any of these irregularities
3159368 theyre cheating and were sending them home you will never play chess in california again
3159369 how many games of chess has this team played this year
3159370 i dont know i dont have those records with me
3159371 would it surprise you to know that youve played 23 games of chess and youve won every one of them
3159372 dont you think its odd that you never lose a game of chess
3159373 sir i know that in the entire time ive gone to this school and been the captain of the chess team i never did anything that was not in the best interest of the players and the students at this school
3159374 they didnt cheat and even if they did cheat which they did not i wasnt even there i didnt do anything wrong
3159375 on the core principals of each of the 3 modes of gameplay infantry ground vehicles and aircraft
3159376 the previous batman movies opened on average at 47 million whereas dark knight made a record 67 million on opening day alone
3159377 whats the difference here i lay the credit for this movies success at the doorstep of heath ledgers pictured performance
3159378 im a textbook definition of that perfectionist girl who has huge expectations of herself
3159379 its hard for me to take care of myself lets put it that way i am my last priority
3159380 truth i dont im not a lady who lunches its a lull in the day
3159381 weve had audrey hepburn weve had twiggy weve had veruschka weve had kate moss
3159382 im trying to figure out why i am to blame for skinniness truthfully ive never seen myself as being too thin
3159383 sometimes ill look at photos and be like oh thats not a good look but generally speaking im not too thin
3159384 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3159385 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3159386 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3159387 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3159388 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3159389 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3159390 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3159391 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3159392 i just want to take it one start at a time for now and finish the year strong
3159393 nbc has a lot at stake both in terms of the event and a promotional platform for a new television season
3159394 i would think if i were nbc right now id be very pleased its still early but judging off these ratings theyre in very good shape
3159395 they have a lot of big commitments to huge advertisers what else were they going to do
3159396 i dont think there is a corporate halo that carries over because i liked the olympics on nbc i will watch nbc programming i dont think it works that way
3159397 but when they run the promotions on the fall lineup nbc will obviously have the competitive edge against the other networks
3159398 mahaney estimates amazon will sell up to 380 000 kindles in 2008 up from a previous forecast of 190 000 noting that adoption rate would be similar to the first year of sales for apples media playing ipod he sees amazon selling up to 150 000 kindles in the fourth quarter alone

3159409 parents do not have a constitutional right to home school their children
3159410 although the legislature did not amend the statutory scheme so as to expressly permit home schooling more recent enactments demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the legislature of the proposition that home schooling is taking place in california with home schools allowed as private schools

3159418 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3159419 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
3159420 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
3159421 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3159422 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
3159423 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
3159424 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
3159425 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3159426 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3159427 we are not staying home with our children by default
3159428 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3159429 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheque wont come its that much more frightening
3159430 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
3159431 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
3159432 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
3159433 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
3159434 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
3159435 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
3159436 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
3159437 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves

3159440 ncrc brings all of us non profit organizations together as a group with one common goal were sort of a watchdog operation here
3159441 but one of the biggest issues that we will be bringing to gmhc is who are you targeting
3159442 if gmhc really wants to get help to people whove been hit by the foreclosure crisis well this program might not work but were certainly willing to work with them on it
3159443 its our hope that through gmhcs program these people can get back on their feet and one day qualify to be a regular customer of franklin bank
3159444 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward
3159445 its been core duo core solo basically were going to simplify nehalem down to just core
3159446 it looked like it wasnt paying attention to the warnings and so the arm came down and landed on it midway through the middle of the bus
3159447 they were with her she opened her eyes and that was very meaningful to them
3159448 were talking and hugging and crying and trying to get through it together but the fact that were able to talk about it is i think a pretty good indication at this stage
3159449 its hard to assign any rhyme or reason as to why this happened we can just deal with the fact that it did and were trying to get through it the best we can as a family unit
3159450 she was always bubbly that toothy grin you see on tv is barb bachman she always had that smile
3159451 i cant even emphasize how he did what he did it was so amazing because he did it so quickly
3159452 i said speed up go get that bus go get that bus i said my babys on that bus thats all i could say
3159453 its an action ensemble comedy in the vein of oceans eleven where the casting becomes an event it is a bunch of these terrific actors getting together and having a good time its that kind of thing
3159454 its not the perfect situation you certainly would prefer to have all of your starters out there getting the repetitions they need in order to get themselves into game ready shape but from the standpoint of the quarterback eli is at least able to see the different coverages it also provides an opportunity for some of the young guys to step up and become contributors this year we were anxious to see if the young guys would be able to take what they did in practice and bring it to the game we were encouraged by what we saw its not the ideal way you design it but i think were making the best of it
3159455 hes one of the guys that have kind of stood out hes done an especi ally good job hes really one of the guys that i was referring to we saw him on a fairly consistent basis in practice making plays and getting open making some good catches growing in his confidence of the position i was actually anxious to see if it would translate to the game and i thought it did i thought he made some good plays were looking forward to seeing if he can continue to make progress
3159456 that group is such a lunch bucket brigade they just go out and work work work i hate to say it because theyll take it the wrong way but they are the classic group of over achievers they work very well together they are tough kids they play hard and theyre always out there david diehl is certainly the embodiment of that effort hes just there whatever you ask him to do whatever position you have okay coach and hes got a smile on his face going about his business hes very prepared and very professional about it and when hes not there you obviously take notice because it doesnt happen very often
3159457 one of the things that seeps into my frustration is your expectation level is so high your expectation level can be high but its going to take some time when you look at the mixture and the different people that are involved before the precision is as sharp as you want it to be i thought the message fit
3159458 the way that people spoke about life before the tap stand made it seem like a very long time ago its obvious that this is a new time accessible water is moving their village forward and when it comes to challenging gender roles breaking tradition with the past usually we think of big change coming from the top down here this tap stand is changing things from the ground up
3159459 weve started this web site because were tired of seeing the tilton organization play the blame game to glenn and his staff responsibility for uniteds predicament belongs to everyone and everything other than themselves their excuses include high fuel prices increasing costs of security more competition and stronger regulation and they see themselves as victims of these uncontrollable factors it just isnt right and it just isnt true these same factors influence every airline and all the others are handling challenging conditions much better than united

3159522 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3159523 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3159524 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3159525 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3159526 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3159527 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3159528 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3159529 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3159530 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door

3159536 when i was young and one went to the barber the last finishing touch was to dust one with talcum powder from a fine bristled brush that is what the dust was about one tossed it in the air and walked through a fine cloud of it it was done in a different room than the oiling
3159537 what are all those chambers under the floor of the temple of zeus about some sort of initiatory system
3159538 actually they are just economy the upright blocks are the same thing as floor joists in a modern house they support the floor but you dont have to use materials filling in between them
3159539 well we are puzzled by that chamber and of course we have no evidence to tell us what it was as yet but the fire well i told the people kindling the torch to light the fire on the altar of course the altar for that temple is the long thin one in front but in a greek orthodox church the faith in which most people here have been raised the altar is inside the church at the far end from the entrance there being no altar there that they could find they went down to a place where they would expect one to be and lit the torch there

3159551 i think what bernie mac did that few if any have been able to do was become a success here in chicago
3159552 most of our homegrown talent has to go to l a or new york to become famous but bernie he was selling out the chicago theater before he went out to new york thats next to impossible
3159553 whats interesting about bernies career is that he wasnt a mainstream comic at first his act was very edgy and very raw
3159554 bernie would talk about things that other black comics wouldnt talk about like skin color and how being a very dark skinned black man like him made his life very different from other peoples
3159555 he didnt so much cross over as people crossed over to him
3159556 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them

3159574 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3159589 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3159590 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3159591 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3159593 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on
3159594 but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3159595 they would come talk to us given our ability to tax efficient transaction for both parties we have good dialogue with them

3159598 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3159653 the leaders of most european countries and russia would love to have australias so called problem of a high rate of fertility
3159654 australias leaders have an opportunity to show the rest of the world how to capitalize on a countrys greatest natural resource the next generation
3159655 especially because the period of 2002 to last summer 2007 weve had some incredibly pleasant summers
3159656 that has put us into a lot of flow from the northwest out of the arctic and anytime you get air off the arctic its not gonna be warm
3159657 what really makes it interesting is that weve seen two or three events of snow down to 3 500 feet or so in the mountains right in the middle of summer thats definitely not as usual thing here
3159658 thats whats concerning us if this is in fact the pdo
3159659 its an excellent opportunity to see how the pdo may react with it from a scientific standpoint were learning

3159662 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3159663 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3159664 the best of the best were looking at an exceptional level of swimming
3159665 its moving because there is a greater opportunity to race and there is more money in the sport people are investing into thinking about swimming fast
3159666 the suits helps us feel good in the water if you feel good in the water you can do special things
3159667 a big part of sprinting is feel if you dont feel good in the water youre not going to swim well
3159668 where technology is used in sport it is important to be in control
3159669 im not refusing this technology we should control the conditions in which it is developed
3159670 people are faster now but everybody is in the suit so its across the board its not just a few people
3159671 if you look at the pool there is very little movement of the water
3159672 over the last four years ive never seen such a big amount of swimmers especially sprinters compete as much and as regularly against each other
3159673 thats a big part of why youve seen the depth grow and the times drop so steadily this group of guys has been swimming so fast for years they are pushing each other to go faster youve got to find something special each time you race and try and win people are just finding ways to do that and bettering the world records and times and find new ways to sprint
3159674 to make a concerted effort not just to catch apple but to overtake the company in the quality of the desktop experience they deliver users
3159675 this is not an impossible goal but the right direction linux should be heading towards

3159684 the biggest thing and the reason we do them is the challenge of getting 1 000 people working together
3159685 its the best training you can have without actually going through a disaster and its amazing to watch
3159686 you have all these plans and it doesnt happen right away but eventually everything falls into the right slots and youre running on rails
3159687 all the stuff thats really the most important always happens right the guys in suits pulling victims out always get it done
3159688 they are going to try to limit street closures during the exercise
3159689 man im telling you and i appreciate those guys giving me the opportunity that they did i just wish it was for a longer period of time
3159690 that last time it happened it got to me a little that i didnt stay up there longer and they didnt pitch me more and i kind of felt like i got cheated a little bit i should have pitched more been there a little longer
3159691 we call each other on good days bad days and we talk about it one of us is going to have something good to say and were not going to church anything up
3159692 he tells me you gotta do this you didnt do this and i tell him the same thing its just good to have somebody that close to me
3159693 certainly we wouldnt have known he was going to get this much time
3159694 hes done a heck of a job hes just getting better all along really
3159695 his velocity is pretty good and he keeps the ball down probably keeps the ball down as good as anybody we have right there along with sean green
3159696 hes getting some sink on his fastball gets some ground balls
3159697 hes just a guy that everybody likes being around hes funny he has good one liners
3159698 hes a guy that sometimes we give a hard time to because he doesnt seem to take it very well but he does it all in good fun and just laughs along with it great teammate
3159699 i was walking out to the mound he said get back behind the plate get back behind the plate and i said i want you to throw this and stay away from this
3159700 he goes im going to throw my fastball you get behind the plate and the guy hits a three run homer next pitch i mean we almost got into it a couple times on the field it gets bad it got bad but we always made up
3159701 as far as odds my goodness what are the chances
3159702 but were very fortunate and its just its wonderful the way it worked out
3159703 its been a kinda rough year for my brother hes been hurt a little bit hell get back on track hes a strong individual and hell be fine
3159704 you have to believe that things are going to get better im too young to think negatively about it and i just kept a positive attitude the whole time
3159705 and its paid off so far and hopefully i even say this when im 35
3159706 baseball is high octane every day but theres also a lot of down time i notice this more and more especially with a child then i look back at a road trip to atlanta we had all this time from the time i woke up to 3 oclock for the game what was i doing
3159707 i wanted to make it like these are the challenges we deal with and lets discuss it
3159708 i wanted to give a human side to whats going on thats the real main crux of what im trying to accomplish i wanted to get to the academic side of baseball i wanted to be an academic ambassador to the game
3159709 its a way to have an opportunity to see my kids play
3159710 once they stop playing id like to be more baseball operations and stuff of that nature
3159711 over the course of the year bostons alex cora and some of these other guys will call up to talk about hitting

3159740 how how can you know how many times a page has been seen if theres no web counter on it
3159741 yes if you dont have a web counter you cannot count how many times a page has been seen

3159756 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3159757 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
3159758 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
3159759 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that
3159760 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves
3159761 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3159762 we strengthen both they complete their collection of animals and we get equipment
3159763 venezuela is going to get animals of very good quality
3159764 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3159765 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3159766 buying a childs skeleton and masks made of human skin
3159767 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3159768 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3159769 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3159770 the nfl national football league actually requires that each stadium has individual seats but major league baseball is a little more flexible on that rule
3159771 especially the cost of steel and concrete which has increased significantly but the general consensus is that everything involved in stadium construction has become more expensive
3159772 so many of the more expensive venues have been recent because of the one up mentality
3159773 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3159774 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3159775 we re here to provide them with any assistance we can
3159776 i think the challenges for my successor are to continue the momentum to make sure that the navy and the nation really do understand the increasing importance of this theater both europe and africa
3159777 we ve had a very good example lately of the challenges in europe with the russians who basically exhibited aggression of a nature that we ve not seen them do
3159778 i think that the challenges will grow as the theater continues to grow in importance our nation is starting to understand how important africa is
3159779 we let them know our case and the extent of the earthquake
3159780 the determination was this was out of the ordinary and people could not have planned for it
3159781 we then recommend that they file through the claims center
3159782 what kinda paint do i use if i wanna paint some rocks and swords
3159783 well no offense but i dont see the point in buying art i mean for a fraction of the price i can buy a paint by numbers kit or needle point template and id rather spend money on something i made myself
3159784 were working towards a positive resolution but we dont have anything concrete to report at this time
3159785 were five days away from a do or die point im hopeful that well get both guys signed but i cant tell you that we definitely will
3159786 im not really sure what i want to major in yet
3159787 i think both guys want to sign and get out and play pro ball and we want the same thing
3159788 in a perfect world we would have had these guys signed on june 15 and not lost a summers worth of development
3159789 if youre talking about a kid who can basically have a secure future without ever throwing a baseball youd be a fool not to try to get as much as possible but thats probably major league baseballs own fault for letting it get out of hand like that
3159790 it was never a dream of mine to pitch in the college world series
3159791 my dream was to pitch in the big leagues i knew that the money you make is not going to be from your signing bonus its going to be when you make it to the big leagues
3159792 i wasnt going to be some high maintenance guy who was going to hold out for every last dollar
3159793 they should be living the best part of their lives because once they get here its hard work

3159796 well distribute the orange jerseys once we establish who the first unit is going to be
3159797 while were still in a very competitive stage for playing time well withhold them for a while
3159798 hes certainly on the top of the list but i would say that other than anybody whos been a well established previous starter in fairness to the team of competition i wouldnt say that anybody would have a spot locked up
3159799 i would say not only does he have the inside track but he has got ownership of it
3159800 hes a real good player he is one of our most alert knowledgeable players he sees to it that we are properly lined up that all the checks and adjustments are made in a timely way
3159801 the game really makes good sense to him he is set and thats really i would say one of the solid spots on the team
3159802 im just saying it exactly the way i heard one of our coaches say it the other day and it describes it well from the spring weve gone from horrible to hopeful
3159803 were going to be doing quite a bit of live kicking throughout the course of camp to find out what those things are under whatever circumstances weve been kicking the accuracy is significantly up from all three were making progress in that area
3159804 we want to find out whats the range at which the kicker is going to be consistently accurate then after that you find out how far back you can go with that
3159805 thats about it theyre all working hard theyre all progressing as ive said on a couple of occasions were not keeping a daily scorecard on them were looking at the body of work and were giving everybody plenty of opportunities to show us how the club will best operate
3159806 getting to publish kenneth hites unique take on the works of a horror literature icon like h p lovecraft is a real treat
3159807 his knowledge of the world of h p lovecraft is deep and his wit is razor sharp its a thoroughly entertaining and informative read
3159808 im thrilled that atomic overmind chose my first foray into literary criticism to be their first print release
3159809 im even more thrilled at how good they made it look and i hope its the first of many from both of us
3159810 kenneth and i have a history of that dates back to the first suppressed transmission collection
3159811 when he and atomic overmind press approached me about working on the new book i didnt even give them a chance to finish talking before i said yes

3159814 its one of the favorites on the new disc so we cant wait for people to hear it we had a really good time working with brian for the video too and were very happy with his work
3159815 kids come out and go totally bonkers or wait in line for two or three hours just to say whats up its really amazing to be a part of this

3159818 the opportunity will be here for him to return once his family issues have been resolved
3159819 for the time being that needs to be his focus
3159820 to be nominated alongside prestigious nominees especially with us being such a young company is quite an honor and very encouraging
3159821 we are now offering our new countertop acrylic displays with an optional 7 inch lcd screen for free with a minimum purchase this classy acrylic display provides dealers a fancier flashier way to draw in customers and increase profitability from our product lines
3159822 the idea of a crossover starring all active duty models is something ive wanted to do since we started dirty bird pictures
3159823 several of the guys were wrestlers and ever since we featured a 10 minute wrestling clip our customers have been shouting for more
3159824 fresh hot young muscle bound men wearing nothing but skin tight spandex wrestling gear that accentuates every muscle and bulge
3159825 theyre wearing nothing underneath those singlets not even a jock
3159826 dink asked me to use that story as the basis for the film
3159827 my idea was to add some fight club action into the mix and go from there
3159828 i think fans of active duty will find this very special
3159829 most of the guys have never played a character before this is a great opportunity to see an entirely different side of these performers
3159830 the cast was one of the most attractive ive ever worked with
3159831 even my crew was gushing over them and it was one of the most fun times ive had on a shoot
3159832 i think fans of both active duty and dirty bird pictures will equally love
3159833 the product segment in india has the potential to grow ten times its current size and touch anywhere between 9 5 billion and 12 billion over the next decade
3159834 the required growth rate of 30 to 35 to take the industry from its current revenue of 1 4 billion in fy08 to about 12 billion in fy15 seems quite achievable
3159835 my role is to look for talent who will join us internationally including for the two studios in california and now for our new set up in bangalore
3159836 we hired these graduates last october and trained them in paris
3159837 another reason why we looked at india is because next year internationally we will be completely moving towards a 3d stereo format
3159838 we have supervisors trained at dreamworks who will exclusively work on our projects in india
3159839 this is a vision for the next five years in terms of our priorities and how we believe that vision can be achieved
3159840 it needs to use taxpayer funds to try to convince the community that it has done a good job
3159841 you know the business of government doesnt just stop we cant just take time out government goes on on a daily basis
3159842 how do you take control when you dont have authority over the funds or maintain clear authority to make decisions that stymies processes
3159843 we dont get clear approvals and dont feel empowered to make decisions that might have budgetary impacts those decisions can get made but rarely
3159844 if these agencies want to hire security people they need to let them do their job
3159845 im struck with how little power and capability to influence the cisos have
3159846 most are left to cajole those who own the it funds to do what needs to be done from a security standpoint few if any have direct responsibility
3159847 from a priority perspective theres so much on the plate
3159848 the key is deciding which in the stack of initiatives deserves more attention
3159849 once you know what youve got you need to know risks and develop a concrete executable plan to reduce or eradicate those if possible
3159850 that cant happen next fiscal year it has to happen right now none of the security issues that agencies face appear overnight new ones roll up constantly so cisos need the ability to take corrective actions immediately
3159851 what does that really tell me how bad off am i are there things we need to stop now and fix immediately
3159852 for once id like to say well across our entire operating divisions we have one particular problem here and one weakness there and then have a program in place that shows collectively that we recognize the problem and have an approach to solve it
3159853 if you want to be compliant with all the mandates and regulations and laws and requirements you can do that but that takes you down a path toward compliance for the sake of compliance not overall improved security
3159854 but when they look at associated dollar cost the answer is no way we dont have the funds lets make the federated approach work effectively but how do you do that when you dont have the authority to oversee the staff and budgets until something hits the fan the resources are not there for information security
3159855 if they have any prayer of securing systems and networks
3159856 the fiefdoms are strongly entrenched and have been doing business a certain way for years
3159857 fisma was helpful in that it provided attention and focus on the problem but it did nothing for governance we now have a situation where the federal ciso is struggling with compliance that has very little to do with actual security and with no clout to hold individuals accountable for not following the appropriate security protocol the answer is improve the law
3159858 there should be an elevation of the position providing cisos more authority and more ability to enforce the policies rather just acting as recommending bodies
3159859 this cant be a political issue its a national security issue a public safety issue an economic viability issue no matter how you look at this information security has to apply across the entire government enterprise if you cant manage it you cant secure it
3159860 foremost we wanted to continue the long standing tradition of having an official mascot that was part of the student body
3159861 we all agreed the reveille needed to attend classes and live in a home like environment on campus while receiving top quality care love and attention

3159869 we do evaluate the impact of exchange rate changes on cost of living allowance rates at all locations worldwide on a biweekly basis
3159870 the impact on actual post allowance rates will vary however depending on where each surveyed location falls with regard to local purchase points
3159871 as each location has unique surveyed living patterns and varying local costs and the proportion of goods bought locally using local currency varies when and by how much a change in exchange rate will impact cola will also vary by location
3159872 people in the market are pricing out any chance of european rate hikes geoffrey yu a currency strategist for ubs ag in london told bloomberg news on friday
3159873 he told me he wanted to go to the jets he said he wanted to back brett up and that he always liked green like back in his philly days

3159878 fled into a neighboring compound where they held 11 non combatants hostage including several children and an infant

3159881 the taliban uses innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces

3159883 based on the lack of trauma and diphenhydramine level we determined that she died from diphenhydramine intoxication
3159884 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3159885 there is a problem with some of these sons of iraq in terms of literacy
3159886 we re helping the iraqi minister of education to form a literacy program to in fact train some of them so they would be eligible to join the security forces
3159887 may return to violence or form new militias of concern
3159888 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3159889 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3159890 life is not a problem to be solved but a mystery to be lived

3159895 here in queensland theres a waiting list of around about 38 000 people waiting for public housing
3159896 now what surprised me is the staggering amount over 30 per cent of that waiting list are pensioners
3159897 so where are they living now obviously they cant afford to meet the costs of the private rental accommodation which is almost equal per week to the single pension
3159898 things like perhaps taking in a boarder or sharing two single pensioners sharing a house or a unit so that they can manage

3159907 feel like a majority group in a public setting this empowers the muslim community by providing a sense of brotherhood and its also a great opportunity for everyone to see muslims having fun and enjoying time with their families
3159908 if you were going to the amusement park wouldnt you like to know if this special event was planned for the same day wouldnt you want to know about the halal food about women in burqas and niqabs

3159932 conformally wrapping surfaces with stretchable sheets of optoelectronics provides a practical route for integrating well developed planar device technologies onto complex curvilinear objects
3159933 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
3159934 we can now for the first time move device design beyond the flatland constraints of conventional wafer based systems
3159935 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses
3159936 hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
3159937 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities
