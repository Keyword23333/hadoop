4990018 can you provide any documentation or evidence of your claim that two different securities which attempt to track the same index will not cause an investor to run afoul of the wash sale rule
4990019 tax courts have ruled that if you swap the securities of one company for the securities of an unrelated company then the securities are not identical and a tax loss is allowed therefore swapping a vanguard mutual fund for a schwab mutual fund should not create a tax wash lets apply the same precedence to index funds if you sold the vanguard 500 fund at a loss and simultaneously purchased the schwab s amp p 500 index fund for the same amount in my opinion a legitimate tax loss in created
4990020 theres some debate but no direct authority on the question of whether two mutual funds keying off the same index are substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule can you sell one s amp p 500 index fund at a loss and buy a different s amp p 500 fund the same day without having a wash sale because there is no direct authority dealing with this question reasonable minds may disagree its always possible to identify differences between funds managed by different companies such as expense ratios and tax load some people conclude on this basis that funds maintained by two different companies are never substantially identical my feeling is that those differences arent enough to prevent the two funds from being substantially identical the point of the wash sale rule is to determine whether youve changed your position relative to the market if you can lay the price graph for your new investment on top of the price graph for the old one and never see a significant disparity as would be the case for two high quality s amp p 500 funds the investments should be considered substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule

4990216 in any form of cricket whether in test cricket or one dayer the start is very important
4990217 he is in a very good nick he and gautam gambhir have played well in the test series also of course they will have some added responsibility but no real pressure
4990218 you can say we have got used to the conditions a bit to the wickets in sri lanka overall the warmup was good but an international game is completely different from any side game
4990219 i am a great believer in hard work doing little things right
4990220 in odi cricket in general putting runs on the board is crucial but having a bowling attack that picks up wickets you can fall back on that but not everyday we need to be very consistent
4990221 now in the middle they have two bowlers previously it was muttiah muralitharan and we look to score from the other side but now they have two specialist bowlers who dont really give loose balls to cash on
4990222 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4990235 a gun battle erupted in a store at a shopping mall in miami gardens that left two people dead and shoppers running for cover
4990236 the manager managed to shoot one of the subjects who is now deceased inside and the manager was also shot
4990237 the female had a gun in her possession and she admitted to using it on the victim who we had found
4990238 the altercation blossomed into the gun shot victim brining a large metal pipe of some kind allegedly and swinging it at this lady s husband she was in fear of his life and therefore she took the gun she had in her pocket out and fired four rounds
4990239 due to the fact that she was acting in a way that was in self defense of her husband and everybody else that was there they are deciding not to pursue charges against her

4990257 stocks looked set friday august 15 to extend the previous sessions advance as oil prices fell further and the dollar rallied less than three hours before the open nasdaq and s amp p futures were higher suggesting early gains for wall street stocks rose thursday ending a two session losing streak as investors cheered lower oil prices and picked up shares battered in the recent selloff
4990258 valuations are a key driver for share prices its impossible to predict the exact timing of market turning points though a trend may go to excess that doesnt mean the pendulum will swing back quickly sometimes investors get caught up in market momentum thats especially true during booms when investors may keep bidding prices higher and higher
4990259 an energy fueled 0 8 monthly surge in consumer prices double the rate expected by economists boosted the year over year inflation rate to the highest level since the 1991 gulf war but the big august slump in energy prices could counteract the july jump meanwhile another report on first time unemployment filings points to continued weakness in the u s labor market

4990272 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
4990273 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
4990274 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
4990275 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
4990276 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
4990277 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
4990278 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful

4990287 the very serious concerns about how the police handled this investigation from beginning to end
4990288 that is why my position is to support the calls that are made by families here for the establishment of an independent tribunal
4990289 they obviously have lost all faith and we have seen debacle after debacle in terms of the investigation of this terrible atrocity what we need to do is support the families in the demands they now make
4990290 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4990291 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me

4990294 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4990295 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family
4990296 i would not willingly support any move to have government interference in tv rights which may control packer because as i have said many times before it would inevitably bring control of the fees that may be paid
4990297 i think you will get a good and sympathetic hearing from the cricket fraternity in london but what use is that if the powers that be wont let tours take place
4990298 those who claim recent events may have rectified the trouble may well be right in the short term but in 10 20 years it would certainly return and be a bogey once more and i think our responsibility is to provide now against such a contingency

4990426 as human beings were not born to experience the things that we experience in war when you experience it it changes you
4990427 my main focus since ive returned home is to help other individuals like myself to ensure theyre getting the things they need from someone who understands what theyre going through
4990428 we were out of luck especially in the last few points
4990429 we tried our best but the result was still disappointing
4990430 i made many unforced errors my defense was weak i was not as strong as i used to be
4990431 i had dreamed of having a better result than athens unfortunately i couldnt make it
4990432 we played our best the other days we could not play to our maximum level

4990434 its crazy to think that madonna is too old at 50 it is time for someone to be a role model for the over 50s
4990435 madonna is successful because shes doing what she wants not what people want her to do she has got an amazing talent for working with the right people she knows who to work with at the right time
4990436 i think discipline extreme focus and health are all important madonna has a very good mindset she does everything she can for herself whereas a lot of people seem to turn things against themselves she doesnt do drugs she goes training she has a family life and a spiritual life
4990437 i just had a coffee with a guy a musician i cant say who in soho well see what happens some of the boys that im hanging with will read this and think its strange when i say im single
4990438 but it takes a lot to say right were doing this there are a couple of things that i entertain myself with at the minute but its borderline platonic right now so cmon lads gear it up a bit
4990439 i still meet boys all the time they are lovely gorgeous and funny they tick all the boxes but theres one thing that happens to define love and i dont know what it is until it happens
4990440 its bizarre its the one thing we all talk about with our mates whats on our minds at the pub or at work whats the one thing we are looking for its that well it is for me and my mates
4990441 ive only done what most teenage girls have done fallen in love made some wrong decisions been treated badly by some people the only reason you become strong is because of the things you experience in life
4990442 love does fascinate me because im a bit of a control freak but real love you cant choose it thats the weird thing about it it chooses you
4990443 i did have it once with a guy i wrote stepping stone about him he wasnt a local guy in wales but he was someone i knew ive never told him that the song was about him he was so out of reach
4990444 ive never had that before it was unrequited but it was real it was all consuming
4990445 i assume sitting here today this is probably the roster we will go to camp with
4990446 well continue to work the phones and were always going to consider things but id say this is our core for the most part
4990447 obama did reasonably well though not overwhelmingly so i loved his saying he wouldnt have appointed clarence thomas and antonin scalia to the supreme court and his firm support of choice and gay civil unions he seemed very comfortable talking about his christian faith on the other hand that bothered me a little bit too im not sure why obama voluntarily sat down for a nationally televised conversation about his private religious faith with a relatively conservative christian leader as though thats a reasonable station of the cross so to speak for a major american presidential candidate theres no doubt rick warrens congregation has done good things on social justice issues especially aids but warren has made no secret of his extreme views on abortion and gay rights as well as his support for the iraq war obama visiting the church speaking there smart politics attending a nationally televised forum almost as big deal as a debate at such a church i think that was wrong
4990448 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4990449 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4990450 it would be very hard not to improve any of the london airports wed staff security queues properly and passport controls which are a joke at the moment we have people being delayed one or two hours just to get back into their own country
4990451 this is the new biometric scanner but you havent told me about it
4990452 they put the protection of the killers above the attainment of justice
4990453 the very serious concerns about how the police handled this investigation from beginning to end
4990454 that is why my position is to support the calls that are made by families here for the establishment of an independent tribunal
4990455 they obviously have lost all faith and we have seen debacle after debacle in terms of the investigation of this terrible atrocity what we need to do is support the families in the demands they now make
4990456 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4990457 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
4990458 ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are ripping customers off by adding
4990459 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
4990460 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4990461 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family

4990466 it is considered traditionally the only people that are supposed to learn the kabala are men and they have to be over the age of 42

4990493 i was in dublin last week to do a job with disney so i arranged for my best friend and my sister to come down for a girly night out and go for something to eat
4990494 my best friend nichola said to me do you know that i havent seen you for four months that made me realise how the time has flown in since i left blue peter it would be really nice if i got some downtime soon it would be lovely to come back to bangor and go and sit on ballyholme beach

4990498 well any presenter nowadays wants to do a big saturday night show
4990499 i love working in childrens tv and i would not turn my back on it but i would like to do tv for an adult audience
4990500 i hate that saying about things being in the pipeline but there are are some things well see what happens
4990501 i live and socialise in london and since being crowned miss great britain ive been linked to people like footballers
4990502 people may have a perception of me that i only go for certain types of men but nothing could be further from the truth
4990503 some of the men who approach me in london clubs can be cocky and full of attitude but id prefer a normal guy with a normal job
4990504 if he worked as a binman and he made me laugh who knows having a good sense of humour is top of my list someone who doesnt take life too seriously
4990505 the last time i was snapped kissing a beautiful woman was on my wedding day
4990506 i have a love hate thing going on with rex
4990507 i think the producers were scared of him walking out and as he is one of the more dominant housemates i think they put his girlfriend nicole in the house to stop him walking
4990508 sometimes id love to hit him he is an arrogant so and so but there is definitely something sexy about him
4990509 baird showed his face in ballymoney once or twice but he has been in the ballymena area for months now working as a joiner
4990510 but since sunday life exposed his violent past the people he works with just dont want anything to do with him any more and are giving him the cold shoulder treatment
4990511 and hes already been put on the streets by his best pal after he discovered baird was having an affair with his girlfriend
4990512 he had been living with him at his home near cullybacky but when the pal found out about the fling he threw baird out
4990513 i have said everything i have to say to the people that matter the parole commissioners
4990514 im really sorry for what ive done and im just trying to get on with my life
4990515 i hadnt really any reason but i was tired my relationship with alison was not getting on i had a few drinks taken and phillip was crying
4990516 i hit him in the stomach with the knuckle bent back
4990517 i grabbed him by the arm and kicked him i let him go and he stumbled back a few steps
4990518 i kicked him again in the stomach and he fell on the stairs
4990519 hes worked for us for a good while and ive got nothing but good to say for him he gets on with his days work hes trying to re establish his life and get on with it
4990520 three different sources rang me to ask if i would consider this guy it came from the church from within the prison and a third source
4990521 i would be quite careful like all employers i took all the information i could get i brought him in and worked him through a system where i could monitor him quite closely with people who knew his background and were willing to work with him
4990522 if he stepped out of line in any way even to use bad language i rung them authorities and they just put him straight back inside
4990523 hes in a very very strict regime i have been given very precise guidance on it risk management i was very well briefed
4990524 they said to me they would not be letting him out unless they had confidence in him
4990525 i am coming from a christian point of view you give a guy a second chance
4990526 the guys he is working with i have made them away of where he is coming from and some of them have commented to me and a couple of guys have objected to working with him
4990527 i said to them that i respect their wish and they will not be on the same sites
4990528 if theres a big splash in the paper i am probably going to have to dismiss him image is so important today and i cant afford negative image
4990529 this whole thing is just hard to take in and i cant believe we have lost our beautiful daughter i dont think we will ever get over this terrible tragedy
4990530 when we were in the hospital and jennifer was in a coma i was just hoping and praying that she would pull through but i knew the situation wasnt good
4990531 she was my blue eyed girl and i dont know how im going to live without her every time i think of her lying in that hospital bed it just breaks my heart
4990532 if there are still young people out there who drive recklessly then i would beg them to stop because they have no idea what devastation they could cause
4990533 if they could step into our world for a brief moment then they would realise the horrors of what can emerge from a car accident
4990534 you never think that something like this will come to your door and nothing can prepare you for it i just hope that jennifer is the last young person in this society who loses their life in such a tragic accident
4990535 i still want to know what happened that night but that can come at a later time we are just grieving for a beautiful human being at the moment
4990536 we also recognise that the young lad driving the car is in a terrible state and he will have to live with what happened for the rest of his life
4990537 his parents are also deeply upset by what happened and we know their lives will never be the same again its just such a terrible tragedy for everyone and an experience that i wouldnt like to see anyone endure
4990538 the number of people who turned out to pay tribute to jennifer was incredible
4990539 we have had tremendous support from friends and from relatives in belfast and dublin they have all in their own way helped us through a very difficult time
4990540 i would also like to thank the emergency services staff at the royal and our police family liaison officer for doing everything they could to help us
4990541 jennifer was just so full of life and just lived for the weekend
4990542 she was such a popular girl and was just looking forward to starting her career as a nurse we cant believe this has happened and we all just miss her so much
4990543 this is a very difficult time for our family and we will never forget the happy memories we had with jennifer we have had a lot of support and we cant thank people enough
4990544 i cannot begin to understand the pain and suffering that tommy and oonagh and their family are experiencing at this time but i continue to remember them in my thoughts and prayers
4990545 they have lost their cherished daughter and little can be done to ease their pain
4990546 the rowden familys lives will never be the same again
4990547 other young people sustained injuries that they will carry for a long time and the young driver has received a life sentence of sorts with what he will have to carry into his future as a result of this accident
4990548 i would urge all young drivers to think clearly will your actions affect you or others and is the risk worth it
4990549 wow that was a lousy day i wish it didnt even happen
4990550 in the next 10 years we will put a man on the moon

4990570 but it doesnt mean much to the family because they lost kanu
4990571 but last but not least we would like to thank this one special person who made all this possible he well and truly went beyond the call of duty
4990572 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4990573 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4990574 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4990575 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4990576 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4990577 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4990578 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4990579 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4990580 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4990581 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day
4990582 were a working farm and times have been difficult so this has helped
4990583 it was a case of helping each other so the obvious logo to do was the mill including the water wheel
4990584 not only was it a huge success for us it helped put the mill on the map with tourists too
4990585 they want to see it so people are coming prepared with their wellies because it is so muddy
4990586 in the next 10 years we will put a man on the moon

4990596 we want to be fair with betis as the first option
4990597 next week it will be defined between betis or roma
4990598 we obviously have a lot to analyse and to take care of
4990599 even though roma will play the champions league and they mean a lot we also have to consider what they are going to offer whether nery will be a key player for them or not
4990600 the decision depends on ourselves we must be careful it is not a matter of money

4990615 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist

4990684 i said you took your time in getting here you should have been here fourteen years ago
4990685 we accept no ifs and buts in here you should know that by now
4990686 and someone told you that you were mad number two i should think you might be very mad at them for making so fundamental a mistake
4990687 when you cant tell the difference between mad number one and mad number two i might ask
4990688 i dont want to return all the way up this hole even if it is to the top of the world
4990689 then how do you think i feel theres not a drop of water to be seen anywhere and us hippopotamuses need loads of water
4990690 mr hippopotamus i would like to thank you for the ride from out of that cave or whatever it happens to be and i feel that must tell you that it was the most comfortable hippopotamus ride i have ever had in my entire life alice omitted to tell the hippopotamus that it was in fact the only hippopotamus ride she had ever had thank you again
4990691 my dear child i hardly noticed you there at all so light and small a girl that you are
4990692 and any time you feel the need to take a ride from out of that space please feel free to jump on as i pass you by
4990693 thank you thank you so very much i will keep that invitation in my invitation book
4990694 and if i dont find a need for it i will treasure it always
4990695 if there is to be any hole falling around here we must first have a vote to decide who shall fall through it the first is that clear

4990701 none of us can when we are upset we sway thats why we sway so much in the wind because we dont like it because it upsets us so
4990702 oh i am so sorry to hear that is there anything i can do

4990704 if i upset you so will you please forgive me
4990705 hungry how can you be hungry when your roots can find all the food you need
4990706 fertilizer all plants we need fertilizer at some time in their lives

4990708 do you know where you can find us some fertilizer
4990709 go to the fertilizer mine there you will find all the fertilizer we need
4990710 i am sorry i dont know none of us plants know where it is located
4990711 shall i go to the left or to the right or continue on straight ahead
4990712 and if i had taken me one minute longer i fear i might never have arrived here at all
4990713 what a strange sign to put up outside a mine
4990714 yous will never find anything if yous dont look for it
4990715 how can i be invading your home when all that i am doing is looking for some fertilizer
4990716 if i wur tbreak into yours home i might very well end up before a gistrate
4990717 a gistrate who could easily see fit tsend me tjail
4990718 but yous cum down here willy nilly like yous owns the place and are upset if i reprimand yous for doing so
4990719 it might be an old mine tyous but its a home tme
4990720 if you were an elf or a troll or a goblin i might believe that
4990721 and what makes you think that i am not one of those creatures
4990722 oh yes mr elf i did you see its not for me its for all the aspidistras they havent been fertilised for ages i think it might be years and years
4990723 fle my name is fle and before yous start laughing let me tell yous that its spelt fle thats elf backwards you know old mum thought it would be easier for her to rmember
4990724 forget bout the mr bit makes me feel older than yous already think i am
4990725 how many sacks will yous be requiring yous can have as many as ylike yknow
4990726 i only need the one small bag i shant be able to carry any more than that
4990727 only the one bag hardly seems wurth putting it on
4990728 there are one hundred aspidistras perhaps two hundred on a good day and i suspect that is far too many for one small bag of fertilizer oh fle what am i going to do
4990729 there will be plenty of fertilizer for all of them there oispidistries
4990730 you are the nicest elf that i could ever have hoped to meet
4990731 that be tstop folks cuming in an staaling the fertilizer
4990732 keeps everyone on their toes it dus thinking that there might be
4990733 now how shall i ever be able to find my way along it
4990734 we are upset that we have overgrown the path and ruined your chances of ever finding the white rabbit
4990735 fle do you know how i can ever hope to find the white rabbit if there is no path for me to follow
4990736 do you know where he might possibly be found fle he said we must return to the top of the world and im terribly afraid i might never find my way up there again
4990737 would that be under r for rabbit or w for white
4990738 cos i figure the more yous rush the slower yous will be goin
4990739 please mr fle alice thought to address him by mr as a way of spurring on the old elf please tell me where i can find the white rabbit
4990740 all that yous have to do is follow yours nose and before long you will see his neat little house i hear its the very same one as the one in wonderland with a bright brass plate on the front door spelling the name w rabbit sees i told yous it wus easy
4990741 i shall take off my shoes and socks and bathe my tired feet
4990742 if you were paying attention as you should have been
4990743 you might have heard me when i said excuse me
4990744 you do me an injustice to even suggest that i am capable of such a thing
4990745 i am sorry if i offended you but i am not in the habit of seeing balls spinning so closely to my face especially when i awaken
4990746 oh its all right really everyone says that to me
4990747 ball spinning comes as second nature to me and half the time i dont realize that i am actually doing it
4990748 i am getting so frightfully forgetful since my arrival to wherever i am i might wonder if i had remembered to bring my own head if it were not still attached to my body
4990749 i am king tut king of all the white sea lions
4990750 and i am alice if it pleases your royal highness
4990751 i have never been one for formalities just call me tut
4990752 may i be so bold as to ask where you are going
4990753 were to follow my nose but i am getting so confused
4990754 if it is the left or the right hand side of my nose that i should be following oh tut can you see what a peculiar quandary i am in
4990755 but dont you know that left is right and right is left when you are in this part of the world
4990756 left is right and right is left how can that be
4990757 look at my compass alice had no idea where tut had procured it from see how the needle spins didnt the white rabbit tell you anything
4990758 and if this is right the direction i must go is surely over to the left
4990759 but how shall i travel up and over to the left
4990760 a kipper dont you know that kippers are made in smoky old sheds
4990761 thats what i must do isnt it i must wish for help to get me up and over
4990762 it took me a while to work it out all those confusing directions
4990763 but i got there in the end now how shall i begin
4990764 but how can i get all the way up there
4990765 i have it i wish i wish i wish for an escalator an escalator to take me all the way up to the top of the world
4990766 and perhaps then i shall catch up with the white rabbit at his neat little house at the top of the world
4990767 there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement
4990768 without the help of my team mates this isnt possible

4990783 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4990784 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4990785 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money

4990791 the process sees the enzymes for making hfcs being fixed to a column by the use of a synthetic fixing agent called glutaraldehyde
4990792 however this agent does not come into contact with the high dextrose equivalent corn starch
4990793 we would object to the use of the term natural on a product containing hfcs that has a synthetic substance such as a synthetic fixing agent included in or added to it
4990794 we would also object to the use of the term natural on a product containing hfcs if the acids used to obtain the starch hydrolysate do not fit within our policy on natural

4990824 i arrived at the games not feeling particularly confident and its been a very hard week full of emotions its taken a lot out of me to get to this point he djokovic really went for it in the second set and i couldnt do a thing luckily for me he lost concentration right at the end
4990825 i can only thank all the spanish athletes in the village im having a great time i was very tired when i got here because id never been away from home for so long before but everythings much simpler when youve got your team mates all around you the way im made im much more of a team than an individual player when i was little i always used to enjoy watching team games what i feel when i play for my country here or in the davis cup is completely different to how i feel when i play for myself although im always representing spain
4990826 fighting appears to have been concentrated in two neighborhoods while buildings in the rest of the city stood intact
4990827 pretty much the rest of the way except weve still got some situational stuff to go in on monday and tuesday but weve already got a preliminary game plan in place and a lot of the stuff that were going to use against louisiana tech is already in its just packaging it down to exactly what were going to do the things weve done well well use them against latech the things that were not good at right now we wont its not like weve got to do a lot of stuff because what we have in is pretty much what were going to run all year we just have to get better at it so thats the quest right now
4990828 omigosh im moving to a city in two monthts that ive never visited and i have to sell a house and try to find a new job and make new friends and learn how to navigate a new city with a different climate

4990832 easter is the holiday in december when we put up a nice tree exchange presents and celebrate the birth of jesus
4990833 easter is the christian holiday that coincides with the jewish celebration of passover jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and jesus was later deceived and turned over to the romans by one of his disciples the romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the side made to wear a crown of thorns and was hung on a cross with nails through his hands and feet he was buried in a nearby cave which was sealed off by a large boulder
4990834 five days later we met our new daughter nicki at the l a airport wearing the only clothing cindy could find on the trip back a 7 up t shirt she bought in the bangkok airport
4990835 the mccains have already saved an infant from death and raised her as their own
4990836 i know were spending i added it up for the first time we spend between the two kids on extracurriculars outside the classroom were spending about 10 000 a year on piano and dance and sports supplements and so on and so forth
4990837 i know you are working very hard and struggling to bring up this school but i have said i will assist the school and i will do so
4990838 but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me
4990839 and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them
4990840 but the lord hardened pharaohs heart so that he would not let the children of israel go
4990841 now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him but all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves
4990842 slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women
4990843 their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished
4990844 thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword destroying it utterly
4990845 for every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death
4990846 thus saith the lord god of israel put every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbour
4990847 when thou goest forth to war against thine enemies and the lord thy god hath delivered them into thine hands and thou hast taken them captive and seest among the captives a beautiful woman and hast a desire unto her that thou wouldest have her to thy wife then thou shalt bring her home to thine house and she shall shave her head and pare her nails
4990848 whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day he shall surely be put to death
4990849 the thought and the language of his sermons lingered in the mind like strains of melodious and inspiring music
4990850 the just shall live by faith the just shall live by faith
4990851 therefore being justified by faith let us have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
4990852 i wonder if the preacher is going to explain to me what believing is what faith is i never heard any one succeed in explaining faith
4990853 uncle reuben can you explain this faith in de lord and faith in de debbil
4990854 to be sure i can there is two things in de fust place faith in de lord and then faith in de debbil now in the fust place fustly there is faith what is faith why faith is jes faith faith aint nothing less than faith faith aint nothing more than faith faith is jest faith now i done splain it
4990855 if you mean by faith in the lord the simple idea of believing what the scripture says concerning him the idea of believing its teachings about the lord jesus christ to be true if that is what faith means then all of us are believers all have faith
4990856 you hear what that man says do you believe it
4990857 the man is insane or certainly he does not believe it for if he did he would not sit perfectly still and remain perfectly unconcerned
4990858 often i fear that i do not really believe it if i did believe it the gospel would have more power over my heart and more power over my life than it does have and what oh what shall i do
4990859 therefore being justified by faith let us have peace with god
4990860 being justified by faith let us have peace with god

4990866 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
4990867 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
4990868 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
4990869 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
4990870 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
4990871 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me
4990872 decker was calling me a chicken s mother f get out and i will beat your ass
4990873 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
4990874 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
4990875 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
4990876 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
4990877 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
4990878 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss

4990891 i feel so good about myself when i go home
4990892 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away

4991123 faculty usually underestimate the complexity and difficulty of making a university operate well they think it will just happen by itself if administrators would get out of the way this is an ignorant opinion
4991124 i think that sometimes faculty have tunnel vision and do not understand the full picture of what it means to effectively operate and manage a college
4991125 administrators varied in how they responded to this issue some saw faculty members as a group resistant to change while others saw it as a problem of only some of the faculty
4991126 faculty think we administrators have more power than we actually do and have more money than we actually do faculty do not understand or are aware of the great power they have faculty hold the key to change and institutional transformations but most are not aware of that
4991127 play up the us vs them divide rather than taking a more responsible academic leadership role
4991128 i do not want to keep saying this but nobody is going to be leaving the club
4991129 this has been going on and on about santa cruz and other people the more you keep on about it the more it unsettles what we are trying to achieve
4991130 lets dispel all this no one is leaving the club we have had a really good start in this game we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4991131 our defending at times was rubbish we had experienced players internationals who were not at the races
4991132 we gave away a daft free kick for their winner and even then ryan nelsen was offside when the ball came into the box
4991133 its a first game of the season and we had a physical match on the wednesday night and i was a little bit worried before that we would not be very sharp but we started well and were in control and we just couldnt finish them off
4991134 you have that old story that you feel you probably deserved to be punished in the end but i am pleased we did not let in a goal
4991135 is a trophy to finish 12 and win the carling cup not for me
4991136 you see the quality of a team after 38 games
4991137 in the carling cup or the fa cup you play five games and the final and could be drawn against second division teams but you have no quality and are not there at the end of the championship
4991138 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title if you dont win it of course you are frustrated
4991139 that was amazing who said 13 was an unlucky number weve got rid of that one
4991140 before the race we sat down and said we wanted to come here and win this we have worked all this year and last year the last 10 years and it comes down to six and a half minutes or so of hell but with a fantastic result its unbelievable
4991141 a kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous
4991142 good good now youll need to go wait upstairs until i can get them out of here ill be back to get you tomorrow and take you to the burrow but ill need to stay with them tonight to make sure the memory modifications firmly take hold a confundus charm should be enough to convince them to come with me willingly
4991143 but i thought i was supposed to help with the modifications
4991144 i only meant to say that an obliviate strong enough to cause a parent to forget their own child is best done by a witch or wizard with some experience in performing them i can only imagine that would be a most difficult thing to forget once youre a parent
4991145 no ive already no reason to make this harder than it has to be im ready
4991146 its great to see you too you gonna let me in
4991147 i just thought you might not want to be alone tonight when i overheard remus tell bill about the plans and him having to stay with your parents tonight to make sure the memory modifications take hold
4991148 well when i wasnt growing up at hogwarts or the burrow or grimmauld place
4991149 sure dads gonna be sorry he missed this you know
4991150 youre right he is when all of this is over well have to bring him here

4991152 did anyone ever tell you that you have an oddly shaped head hermione
4991153 well i mean look at it its sort of lopsided i think one of your ears is even higher than the other
4991154 but you really should be glad your hair grew out
4991155 maybe you should keep it safe until she comes home huh take it with you you know since its her favourite you could leave it at the burrow if you want mum would keep it safe for you
4991156 that was after we came home from our first shopping trip in diagon alley right after my hogwarts letter came see
4991157 hermione another word and i swear i will turn this house upside down to find naked baby pictures of you
4991158 do you want to finish this tour or not ronald
4991159 even as a little girl i cant imagine you wanting pink walls of course i admit i really cant imagine you as a little girl
4991160 but my mum well you know how parents are she painted the walls in here when i was four
4991161 did she make you wear those lacy dresses and have tea parties too
4991162 ah love had i known i would have come to your rescue long before now
4991163 thats not a promise you can keep you cant see the future or know what lies ahead for us any of us all of us
4991164 okay well technically i should be able to see into the future im sure ive still got my crystal ball from divination at home somewhere and what with all of those years of stellar instruction i received in the area of the sight
4991165 did you ever see manage to see anything inside that crystal ball
4991166 no last time i used the bloody thing was to hold down a piece of parchment that kept trying to roll up when i dipped my quill into the inkwell
4991167 its nice to know it served some practical purpose at least
4991168 that was the only practical thing i ever accomplished with it
4991169 but while i may not be able look into that lovely crystal globe and foretell your future miss granger i promise you will be coming back have no fear love have i ever made you a promise i didnt keep
4991170 i certainly have no intention of breaking my first promise to you
4991171 not intentionally but you cant know whats going to happen you cant promise ill make it back here
4991172 yes i can i dont plan on letting anything happen to you
4991173 no its not harrys gonna need us to be strong

4991176 good to know where i rank in the scheme of things you pillock
4991177 its good to hear you laugh even if you do need your mouth washed out with a bar of soap
4991178 it will take bigger and better than you ron weasley to accomplish a task such as that
4991179 are you now well lets just see how ticklish you are shall we
4991180 wait no thats not what i meant i mean i want to just not with you
4991181 thats not what i meant either blimey listen to me it was different with lavender
4991182 i am so sorry if lavender brown was better at this than i am
4991183 now youre puttin words in my mouth stop and let me think a second before i bugger this up any worse
4991184 bloody hell of course not i just dont want you to think i dont want you to think i came here to take advantage of you i mean youre scared and your parents were just taken out of here to have their memories obliviated and and and i dont know what you want me to say
4991185 hermione i dont want you to do anything that you just

4991216 hes gone fishing at that same place countless times were surprised if it is a drowning he has such great survival skills

4991219 my wife just said why dont you just use a strap

4991221 this strap is foolproof and absolutely the safest and strongest method i have ever seen to lock a deadbolt on any door within seconds
4991222 the problem with something revolutionary like that was that most of the elite athletes had invested so much time in their technique and movements that they didnt want to give it up so they stuck with what they knew
4991223 arguments about whether new forms of sharing or collaboration are on balance good or bad reveal more about the speaker than the subject
4991224 the mistakes that novices make come from a lack of experience they overestimate mere fads seeing revolution everywhere and they make this kind of mistake a thousand times before they learn better but in times of revolution the experienced among us make the opposite mistake when a real once in a lifetime change comes along we are at risk of regarding it as a fad
4991225 new social systems have to tolerate enormous amounts of failure
4991226 you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself as a man and a physician

4991233 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4991234 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
4991235 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4991236 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4991237 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4991238 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
4991239 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits

4991266 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
4991267 im absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue
4991268 i think therein lies the problem bks brand stands for 2 different things in 2 different countries in todays globalized world this is not a sound strategy to pursue at all just because an ad is released for the german market that does not preclude your target customers in another market from seeing and being influenced by the ad this blog is proof of that the second you launch a website or post your t v commercial on youtube youve gone global whether you like it or not and you should be prepared to have your branding activities in one market influence your brands perception in another

4991280 ik heb bewogen in de startblokken en daardoor heb ik mijn start gemist
4991281 ik reageerde op iets maar weet niet op wat in een fractie van een seconde heb ik nog gedacht mijn hand op te steken ik bewoog en dacht dat de starter ons zou terugschieten maar dat gebeurde niet ik miste dus compleet mijn start en op dit niveau is het dan moeilijk om dat op te halen ik heb het nog geprobeerd maar dan ga je verkrampter lopen en mis je eigenlijk je volledige wedstrijd

4991306 i love ellen degeneres i watch her show all the time
4991307 i just want to say congratulations and i am really sorry you didnt invite me to your wedding
4991308 i heard a funny story today and ive been telling it to the maureens
4991309 the water companies are trying to convince ofwat they need to carry out works we feel are excessive and completely unnecessary
4991310 for example one has proposed to build a pipeline that pumps water from the east of the county to the west and another has proposed to build a pipeline that pumps water from the west to the east
4991311 we believe that if the water companies worked together bills for their customers would be much less these problems have been created by more than one company providing water to homes in kent
4991312 i think customers are getting poor value for money at the moment and it will be even worse when their bills go up
4991313 for the five years from 2010 we are looking at more than 20 per cent increases in current bills
4991314 the problem we have in kent is that it is a water stretched area so companies have to invest in and enhance their resources and there will be a vast growth in the population to contend with too
4991315 we are the only area to have been granted area of water scarcity status by the government and this underlines the problems we face
4991316 we have less rainfall than parts of the middle east and only very limited local water sources climate change will only make matters more difficult and we will face increased demand from a growing population and from major new business developments
4991317 we face a 655m programme of work to deliver 329 projects more than anywhere else in the uk specifically for legislation imposed on us from europe
4991318 we also have to spend 450m to cater for growth in the south east
4991319 it also includes some of the biggest engineering projects in europe like the tideway tunnel project which the government wants us to build to take sewage away from the thames and the proposed upper thames reservoir in oxfordshire
4991320 that all comes in at 6 5 billion the highest level of investment proposed by a uk water company ever
4991321 we are conscious that no price rise is likely to be welcomed by our customers but unfortunately this rise is largely the result of unprecedented increases in power costs and the continuing cost of maintaining our day to day water supply operations
4991322 save your best for your fans they deserve and paid to be there when you play well
4991323 i remember where i was when i saw ken griffey jr hit 600
4991324 i remember where i was when sportscenter replayed ken griffey jrs 600
4991325 mo this was fun while it lasted ill go start the car when you hear me honk twice run
4991326 well if it makes my skin soft it should make my hair soft
4991327 the improper benefits issue is a covertly systematic form of racism
4991328 to hell with college higher education and the opportunity to better prepare these young men before sending them diving head long into the biggest stage in professional sports
4991329 perhaps the rules need amending in order to preserve the integrity and quality of both the college and professional games and to encourage all young athletes to go to school
4991330 sicuramente la vittoria di laguna seca stata importante per il mio morale sinceramente potevo stare con lui potevo andare a prenderlo ma poi sfortunatamente scivolato ma pu capitare

4991333 the main principle of industrial ecology is to try and use our waste products to produce something of value
4991334 this reinforces the projection of climate models that we can expect an increase in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events in the future
4991335 and it suggests the model projections are probably on the low end
4991336 and thats exactly what i would expect to happen in texas

4991378 the word of god thus offers us the opportunity to reflect on the universality of the mission of the church made up of peoples of every race and culture this is the origin of the great responsibility of the ecclesial community which is called to be a house of welcome for all the sign and instrument of communion for the entire human family
4991379 it is important above all in our time that every christian community deepen this awareness more and more in part for the sake of helping civil society to overcome any temptation of racism intolerance and exclusion and to organize itself with decisions respectful of the dignity of every human being one of the great achievements of humanity is in fact precisely the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are worrying new signs of this in various countries often connected to social and economic problems which nonetheless can never justify disrespect and racial discrimination let us pray that respect for every person may increase everywhere together with the responsible awareness that only in the reciprocal welcome of all is it possible to build a world marked by authentic justice and true peace

4991407 on the back of splendid results for 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 despite fierce competition in many markets we are elated that zain continues its excellent performance in the first half of 2008 highlighted by crossing the 50 million customer milestone these impressive results reflect the exceptional operational efficiencies in a company that is investing heavily and rapidly expanding across two continents
4991408 we have started to reap the rewards of our recent large investments particularly in iraq nigeria and sudan with these 3 countries now serving more than half of zains 50 million customers and we expect similar rewards when our operations in saudi arabia and ghana commence commercial operations
4991409 we look keenly forward to launching our modern network and commercial offerings in the kingdom promising to offer the saudi community world class telecom services we are confident that our investment in the kingdom will reap rewards for all our stakeholders
4991410 one networks preferential offerings removing borders and high roaming charges have been warmly welcomed and we expect it will be the catalyst for further growth in customer acquisition as we soon plan to link the 2 continents
4991411 zain aspires to be a top ten global telecom company by 2011 and increasing the companys capital will provide the company with the liquidity necessary to continue its ambitious expansion strategy while reducing the borrowing costs of the companys operations and increasing shareholder value in the long term
4991412 zain places a huge emphasis on africa in achieving its 2011 targets of being a top ten global mobile operator with 110 million customers
4991413 this award is an achievement that represents our belief in the african continent and the potential that exists together with our partners and customers we are committed to building the african economic dream and developing telecommunications across the continent as no other telecom company has been able to do

4991418 i have often wondered why some of the best thinkers of our time refuse to believe in human progress after all there was a time when tens of thousands of ordinary citizens flocked to the gates of the roman coliseum to enjoy the sight of wild beasts tearing human beings to pieces today such a sight would evoke revulsion and disbelief of course inhumanity still exists but it is no longer laudable or fashionable in the public sphere with the exception of exhibition killings by jihadist recruiters cruelty is no longer a catalyst of mass arousal even the nazis tried to hide their deeds from the eyes of history be it for fear or shame the trend is clear the norms of civilized society are moving forward and it is those norms not their exceptions that shape the minds of our youngsters and justify our hopes for a better world
4991419 how amateurish was the coliseum in rome compared with modern day satellite rituals of death and brutality imagine millions of living rooms watching their new role model child killer kuntar lowering a huge butcher knife onto his birthday cake to the sound of fireworks and male chorus this is the sword of the arabs samir imagine millions of school children and educators receiving a lesson in moral philosophy from their new master to be honest says kuntar our operation had both civilian and military targets there are no civilian targets its civilian in quotation marks the zionists themselves define the israeli as a soldier who is on leave for 11 months every year imagine millions of democracy hungry arabs watching their most trusted tv station presenting a lesson in practical democracy while the orchestra in the background is waiting for the next tune kuntar says the assassination of sadat was a most wonderful operation it was a wonderful historical moment which i hope will recur in similar cases in a letter to israels press office the station admitted on aug 6 that elements of the program violated al jazeeras code of ethics according to the israeli newspaper haaretz i believe al jazeera owes a more definitive public apology not only to israel but primarily to its viewers for attempting to turn their children into the likes of kuntar to the journalism community for robbing the profession of its nobleness and most urgently to us citizens of this planet for attempting to relegitimize barbarity in the public square

4991456 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
4991457 our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
4991458 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra
4991459 and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
4991460 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented
4991461 that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale

4991464 cada d a surgen en el mundo nuevos medios o espacios de comunicaci n relacionados con la cultura ya sea en formato papel blog programa radiof nico o incluso televisi n por internet los periodistas culturales especialmente los que colaboran con medios diversos al tiempo han de abrirse a estos formatos emergentes abordando el producto cultural de forma novedosa por ejemplo la aparici n de las llamadas revistas de tendencias y estilos de vida que responde a la estrecha relaci n que hoy en d a se establece entre cultura y consumo es un fen meno significativo que el periodista cultural no ha de pasar por alto viajes objetos curiosos y maneras de plantear el ocio son hoy temas tan culturales como la publicaci n de una novela o el estreno de una sinfon a
4991465 si quiere seguir en su profesi n el periodista ha de tomar algo de la mentalidad y actitudes de los curadores de arte de los creativos de publicidad y marketing de los productores de cine y tv y de los gestores culturales y de turismo ese mix es el nico que en mi opini n lograr que sobrevivan
4991466 en el que queden dos o tres publicaciones culturales de l nea dura que probablemente acepten haber perdido la batalla de acercarse al gran p blico y por lo tanto no se sientan presionados en invertir excesivamente en temas de dise o y adem s todo un mercado de revistas para lectores cada vez m s espec ficos que les hablen de su cultura cultura gay cultura urbana de hecho m s de un suplemento cultural ya lleva el nombre de culturas as en plural creo que esto tiene que ver tanto con la correcci n pol tica no se desea que haya una sola cultura imperante como con esta segmentaci n extrema de los mercados
4991467 creo en la dispersi n como un valor y no como un inconveniente as es que considero que el periodista cultural ha de ser disperso por naturaleza
4991468 ante todo deben desarrollar una mirada escudri adora y fijarse en los peque os detalles en lo infraordinario como dir a georges perec para enfocar sus notas y por ltimo un consejo casi televisivo que no descuiden su formaci n cient fica que siempre es la gran olvidada ya sea por desinter s o por temor

4991470 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
4991471 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
4991472 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
4991473 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
4991474 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
4991475 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
4991476 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world

4991492 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4991493 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4991494 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4991495 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4991496 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4991497 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4991498 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4991499 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4991500 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4991501 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4991502 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4991503 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4991504 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4991526 weve got six race cars and 20 race ready engines weve also got a small group of people working for us plus there are people ready to come to work
4991527 with the right sponsorship i have no doubt that we can be a top 15 car within a year or two and then we could be a top five car within 2 3 years we know what it takes to be successful
4991528 we raced with less money than 80 percent of the nationwide teams the last three or so years but what we accomplished was phenomenal

4991538 they dont see as much difference between themselves and others
4991539 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
4991540 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
4991541 the heroes didnt rationalize cheating the way others did they didnt come up with excuses and say it was ok because lots of other students were doing it
4991542 these 29 percent are like undecided voters they would be an especially good focus for intervention

4991587 simply paying taxes is burden enough without the extra costs in time and professional help that too many americans have endured until now the advent of free fast filing for a substantial majority of taxpayers marks a great breakthrough for the presidents agenda to make the federal government put the needs of the citizen first

4991830 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money

4991833 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4991834 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves

4991847 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4991848 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4991849 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4991850 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all

4991857 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4991858 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable

4991900 in the first few years of the century memorabilia sold at vacation resorts and fairs were emblazoned with either 23 or skidoo and the two soon met
4991901 tom lewis originated the fad word 23 in little johnny jones in 1904 and skidoo was tacked on later
4991902 23 was possibly derived from a telegraphic shorthand code not unlike trucker cb code meaning
4991903 suggestions have been made as to the words derivation it is probably a form of a dialect version of

4991911 i always ask people what was your intent and purpose of your article
4991912 simply a heretical forgery much the same as the gospel of judas the gospel of mary and the gospel of philip
4991913 so god created man in his own image in the image of god he created him male and female he created them
4991914 this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman for she was taken out of man
4991915 these guys are animals if they saw a female dog they would harass it
4991916 i think a woman who wears hijab can be more provocative to them
4991917 the more covered up you are the more interesting you are to them
4991918 i feel like with the hijab it makes them wonder what are you hiding underneath
4991919 the more women veil the less men learn to behave as decent and civilized members of society
4991920 and the more women are harassed the more they veil thinking it will protect them
4991921 it makes a woman happy when i call to her it makes her know shes attractive
4991922 the woman herself is the one who makes men harass her
4991923 if shes walking swinging as she goes of course it will happen
4991924 oh the blow dryer is so hot when you blow dry my hair you comb too hard
4991925 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems
4991926 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
4991927 i feel more centered in who i am and what im doing
4991928 i dont seem to have those self doubts like i used to have i feel much more grounded and feel that we are all connected
4991929 brilliant colors and beautiful patterns just stunningly gorgeous more intense than normal reality
4991930 i found myself doing lamaze type breathing as the pain came on

4991935 further research is needed to know if mushroom extracts can be used to treat cancer patients
4991936 this work provides yet another example of the incredible properties of micro organisms in effecting transformations of metals and minerals in the natural environment
4991937 because fungi are perfectly suited as biogeochemical agents often they dominate the biota in polluted soils and play a major role in the establishment and survival of plants through their association with roots fungal based approaches should not be neglected in our attempts to deal with metal polluted soils
4991938 the fungal produced minerals are capable of long term uranium retention so this may help prevent uptake of uranium by plants animals and microbes it might also prevent the spent uranium from leaching out from the soil
4991939 good god no we dont eat fish meat fruit we dont eat anything its all contaminated you cant you cant

4992004 i fell ill seriously upon my return as the surgery did not work well i blame the indian doctors for their carelessness then i went to bangladeshi doctor professor sayeed ahmed siddiqui he is a successful cosmetic surgeon dr siddiqui removed the implant and replaced it perfectly to give me back my normal life
4992005 the care and skill i saw here in cosmetic surgery are indeed of international standard
4992006 the skill and courage shown by bangladeshi doctors in this type of risky operation is really of international standard
4992007 like many departments of medical science people until recently did not have enough knowledge about cosmetic surgery now the popularity of cosmetic surgery in india and pakistan has influenced bangladesh so doctors here think it has a good prospect after their higher education and training in countries like the usa the uk india and pakistan many doctors are practicing in bangladesh and they are doing an excellent job
4992008 it has the same risks that other surgical operations have in appendix operation a person may have infection likewise it may happen to an individual having rhinoplasty but there is no reason to be worried about bangladeshi doctors efficiencies as they are confident skilled and courageous were quite capable to provide international standard services
4992009 people from abroad now come here for cosmetic surgeries the mention of bangladesh must not cause to raise eyebrows all the chemicals and equipment are selectively imported so we can surely meet the global standard
4992010 people are taking growing interest in cosmetic surgery therefore both the commoners and doctors want the government support because it is not possible for everybody to get this expensive treatment and we cant reduce the cost even if we want to as everything are imported if the equipment can be produced locally or imported at the government level then people can receive the treatment at a cheaper cost
4992011 most of those taking this treatment are women they feel embarrassed to talk about the side effects
4992012 in that sense cosmetic surgery is definitely risky in our country one will have to pay a high price if the right place is not chosen for the surgery
4992013 laser treatment in beauty parlour has become popular now but we have to see whether they have doctors if not no one should go to those parlours

4992025 when developing the survey we had two goals in mind
4992026 the first was to encourage patients to take a more proactive role in communicating with their healthcare team about their concerns regarding insulin injections the second was to dispel the myth that healthcare providers were unaware of or were unwilling to address the quality of life issues surrounding insulin injections if we can improve the quality of life for 33 of people with diabetes who are insulin dependent then we can be one step closer to lessening the impact of the disease on our patients lives
4992027 when oral lyn is absorbed through the buccal mucosa its rapid entry into the blood stream mimics and improves upon the rapid acting analogues
4992028 claims that analogues provide superior convenience do have some merit when these agents are compared with insulin injected before meals however when compared with oral lyn which is not injected even those arguments fail to make the case for drugs that cost three times as much as standard insulin

4992113 over the next 20 years as we plan to become a middle income country by raising our economic growth to at least 10 percent from 6 percent now the country will have to produce about 13 000 mw
4992114 a policy is being finalised to give private sector full support which will enable them to invest even in the state run power plants and make then more productive
4992115 no more gas based power plant to be set up in the country

4992170 at the end of the game plessis was injured too so we had to change we knew xabi was only maybe 80 of his ability so it was to protect him
4992171 xabi is our player and he is playing well if he continues to play well i will be really pleased but it doesnt matter if you have one good player and you need another one you have to keep the balance of the team
4992172 i explained to him why i needed money for signing other players
4992173 he can understand if you have javier mascherano lucas steven gerrard and then plessis you have four other midfielders and maybe you can sell one player
4992174 when i was first talking with xabi about a transfer we needed money after these months it is not a question of money we would have to have a massive offer because alonso is a great player
4992175 but if we sell one or two players we have enough money to bring in one more good player
4992176 dont forget we will need eight british players and the left footer we were talking about can play in three positions too

4992202 this extraordinary relationship becomes more vivid when its terms are translated into concrete values i e one kilogram of coal about two pounds if converted entirely to energy would yield 25 billion kilowatt hours of electricity or as much as all the power plants in the u s could generate by running steadily for two months
4992203 in other words matter is energy and energy is matter and the distinction is simply one of temporary state matter and energy are interchangeable
4992204 from the outset he barnett realized he could not proceed at once to princeton to interview dr einstein for he did not have the faintest notion of what questions to ask began to read everything he could find on einstein and relativity
4992205 in the midst of his barnetts researches he began going to princeton not to see einstein but to see others who could prepare him to see einstein
4992206 the daring nature of einsteins concepts the revolution they had wrought in the entire structure of physical and philosophical thought the radical way in which they had redesigned the architecture of the universe all this somehow had to be communicated to a wider audience
4992207 there are two reasons for writing a book on science for the genreal public first is to further mans understanding of the universe he lives in whatever his background or education second is to encuroage young people to study science by giving them a better appreciation of its importance and implications
4992208 in accepting a mathematical description of nature physicists have been forced to abandon the ordinary world of experience the world of sense perception
4992209 questions involving the relationship between observer and reality subject and object have haunted philosophical thinkers since the dawn of reason
4992210 it is the mathematical orthodoxy of the universe that enables theorists like einstein to predict and discover natural laws simply by the solution of equations
4992211 the prime mysteries of nature dwell in those realms farthest removed from the real objective world he changes and distorts its workings by the very process of his observation
4992212 the equations of quantum physics define more accurately than any mechanical model the fundamental phenomena beyond the range of vision equations work as the calculations which hatched the atomic bomb spectacularly proved
4992213 nothing can ever move faster than light no matter what forces are applied
4992214 the velocity of light is the top limiting velocity in the universe
4992215 we cant feel our motion through space nor has any physical experiment ever proved that the earth actually is in motion
4992216 motion is a relative state unless there is some system of reference to which it may be compared
4992217 if matter sheds its mass and travels with the speed of light we call it radiation or energy and conversely if energy congeals and takes on a different form we call it matter since july 16 1945 man has been able to transform one into the other on that night at alamagordo new new mexico man for the first time transmuted a substantial quantity of matter into the light heat sound and motion which we call energy
4992218 in the einstein universe there are no straight lines there are only great circles like most of the concepts of modern science einsteins finite spherical universe cannot be visualized its properties can be described mathematically

4992257 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4992258 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4992259 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4992260 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4992261 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4992273 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4992302 tres medallas en tres juegos ol mpicos y no tengo mucho que decir m s por fin tengo una medalla ol mpica de suelo aunque no sea oro pero tampoco es un bronce que me habr a jodido m s
4992303 era muy complicado sacar medalla era pr cticamente imposible si dragui e hyp lito no hubieran fallado estar amos muy ah y somos cuatro gimnastas para tres puestos
4992304 la gente discute mi forma de entrenar a los hechos me remito si luego me va bien he trabajado muy duro para esto las he pasado canutas en madrid y aqu este es el resultado
4992305 yo de momento sigo cuando me retire ya os lo dir no me ech is todav a que de momento voy ganando medallas espero poder estar en londres en forma sin ning n tipo de lesi n grave
4992306 nervios al ver a dragulescu trabucarse de culo y luego al ver a hyp lito he pensado que no puede estar pasando esto ahora s lo falta que caiga el chino y que me den la medalla
4992307 luego el chino ha competido muy bien adem s estando en casa a m me ha parecido que le han puntuado un poco alto pero yo tampoco he hecho un ejercicio mejor que l as que estoy contento tres juegos tres medallas
4992308 la sensaci n de que iba a ser m s complicado que en los otros juegos
4992309 m s tiempo para pensar ponerse nervioso fallar de todo e iba a ser m s complicado
4992310 ten a un sentimiento de ansiedad y los he visto fallar a ellos y he pensado les pasa lo mismo que a m no han soportado la presi n y pens que ten a que hacer mi ejercicio de suelo que he hecho millones de veces estoy s per preparado para hacerlo y ya tengo que hacer simplemente mi trabajo
4992311 es lo mejor pero hoy viendo que estaba ah la posibilidad de medalla se me ha puesto cuesta arriba un poco primero he visto la nota y no sab a si era segundo y tercero y he tenido que mirar la nota
4992312 es joven y le cuesta asimilar estas cosas estaba muy metido en s mismo

4992315 theres no avoiding what theres no avoiding this adage came to mind when i read the pronouncement by irans islamic revolutionary guards corps commander mohammad ali jafari who said my country is easily capable of closing the straits of hormuz the main passageway for oil freighters if the country is attacked due to its nuclear program
4992316 in my estimation confronting this country which is trying to gain the time necessary to acquire nuclear weapons is unavoidable
4992317 history has taught us that ideological countries only pay heed to victory over their ideology they never accept any halfway situation even when they find themselves on the brink of disaster
4992318 the absolute priority must be our strategic security in the gulf
4992319 confrontation is the solution and there is no solution but confrontation the game of the carrot and the stick played by the u s and e u will be to no avail
4992320 at present we are suffering from two things irans attempts to gain regional hegemony and its attempts to impose its influence via its sectarian allies the fifth column of arab shiite fundamentalists
4992321 perhaps it is a strange coincidence that this time around our strategic interests coincide with those of israel the regime of the mullahs in iran is our enemy and at the same time it is an enemy not just of israel but of world peace and security
4992322 i know that the arab demagogues stand together indiscriminately with anyone who is against israel and america but we need to not be swept away by these demagogues as we were in the past
4992323 in politics nothing prevents you from allying with the devil for the sake of your interests this is what confronting the iranian danger which is close demands of us this issue in my estimation cannot suffer delay or hesitation every passing day benefits iran
4992324 thus we need to push the world powers and especially the u s and the e u towards military confrontation to neutralize the iranian enemy whatever the cost before the nuclear bomb makes it too late even if it is against the will of the arabs of the north
4992325 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
4992326 it is very disappointing that the zimbabwean people do not yet have the government they deserve
4992327 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
4992328 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
4992329 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
4992330 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
4992331 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
4992332 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4992333 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4992334 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
4992335 ce nest pas ludc mais la direction du parti qui avait un probl me avec moi
4992336 but weve still got tomorrow too and weve got a crate motor we can put in it if we have to
4992337 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4992338 the question of withdrawal is being considered now and the decision will be taken as the situation in the region is stabilized
4992339 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4992340 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4992341 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4992342 of course if the numbers are overwhelming thats all going to be out the door
4992343 if were inundated with a bunch of civil unrest it doesnt matter how well we prepare if we get severe numbers its going to take us forever
4992344 the city does not anticipate the need for widespread arrests
4992345 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4992346 even if you only put dogs in there people will be complaining about it i think you ought to have the red cross and amnesty international come take a look at this thing
4992347 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4992348 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4992349 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4992350 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4992351 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm

4992370 i finished second four times and i really learned a lot each time i dont feel surprised because i keep learning and working hard and being relaxed
4992371 i have to play my own game and not think too much i have a four shot lead so theres a lot of room to play good
4992372 of course you dont expect anything like that that probably made my day
4992373 im making a lot more putts than i did the first day
4992374 all i can do is play the best i can and try to shoot a low score ill focus on being consistent hitting fairways and greens
4992375 i actually hit a lot of good shots i just never converted obviously im very disappointed
4992376 it was such a long day and i had a headache so i just tried to concentrate on every shot
4992377 i didnt hit the ball good and i didnt putt good i made birdie on the last hole and have a little chance now theres nothing i can do just come here tomorrow and do my best
4992378 im out of contention to win now but i still feel i can shoot in the 60s out here and that would be a great way to finish to get back into red numbers

4992448 if we look back at what they promised people they didnt do it they might agree on some aspects and tomorrow it will never be fulfilled

4992460 refused all visitation requests telephone calls and gifts for the child
4992461 a far reaching change in the common law a change that could potentially affect the rights of stepparents aunts uncles or other family members who have raised children but lack statutory protection of their interest in the childs visitation or custody
4992462 simply put the nature of the relationship between l r m and t b has no legal significance to the determination of whether t b stands in loco parentis to the child the ability to marry the biological parent and the ability to adopt the subject child have never been and are not now factors in determining whether the third party assumed a parental status and discharged parental duties what is relevant however is the method by which the third party gained authority to do so

4992465 to be substantially limited in performing manual tasks an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most peoples daily lives the impairments impact must also be permanent or long term

4992467 that as a policy matter a proper regard for the independence of the legislature requires that we respect its members personal judgments concerning their participation in matter before them a members decision to vote on a matter before the house represents in our view a core legislative function that must remain inviolate to ensure the continued integrity and independence of that institution
4992468 we accept for purposes of analysis the highly questionable proposition that a public official here a town clerk can retain public office while refusing to perform a generally applicable duty of that office on religious grounds we observe however that this proposition which means that the person religious beliefs of a public officer may in some circumstances trump the publics right to have that officers duties performed is neither self evident nor supported by any of the cases cited by plaintiffs

4992470 a system of civil unions does not bestow the status of civil marriage
4992471 what constitutes a marriage in the state of georgia is a legislative function
4992472 not a judicial one and as judges we are duty bound to follow the clear language of the statute the georgia legislature has chosen not to recognize marriage between persons of the same sex and any constitutional challenge to georgias marriage statute should be addressed to the georgia supreme court
4992473 georgia is not required to give full faith and credit to same sex marriages of other states
4992474 although she is correct that there is a right to privacy of intimacy between persons legally able to consent

4992477 that mr sinclairs incarceration did not automatically terminate his parental rights and responsibilities or even alter the parties legal relationships to be sure if mr sinclairs incarceration had necessitated a change in caretakers ms sinclair would have been entitled to assume primary residential responsibility for them but the childrens care had been entrusted to ms mallette the grandmother since 1991 and although not ideal mr sinclairs absence would not affect the continuity of that care in other words as a practical matter mr sinclairs departure did not require a change in the parenting arrangement that had been devised by the parties many years before
4992478 the ordinance expresses reasonable concerns about the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses such as deleterious effect on surrounding businesses and residential areas increased crime diminution of property values connection to unlawful sexual activities increased unhealthful conduct sexual transmission of disease and harmful effects to children
4992479 certain secondary effects remain a concern with outcall services such as prostitution exposure to minors and obscenity the city has an important interest in preventing such effects and the nudity ban furthers this interest
4992480 we have examined the photographs of plaintiff he could not reasonably be described as a man in his mid 20s with blue eyes
4992481 meanwhile the ruling might serve as a warning to other closeted hollywood types to keep their clothes on if they dont want to be outed especially when dancing with someone of the same sex in a sea of men doing drugs

4992494 it may have been unnecessary for nyt and dci to show carter in his underwear or state that he had been at a bathhouse that night
4992495 the standard however is not necessity c ourts do not and constitutionally could not sit as superior editors of the press
4992496 no constitutional precedent or principle gives a reporter general license to intrude in an objectively offensive manner into private places conversations or matters merely because the reporter thinks he or she may thereby find something that will warrant publication or broadcast
4992497 in furtherance of their right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest
4992498 in furtherance of their free speech rights in connection with a public issue
4992499 carter admitted he ingested blue nitro and gave some to chapman as a result of their ingestion and their bad reaction to the blue nitro carter and chapman were transported to the hospital according to dr evans blue nitro is unpredictable in terms of the effect it has these facts establish that carter overdosed or abused a substance and had a reaction to it and that he had provided the substance to another person
4992500 the only statements in the videotape that could be interpreted to have that meaning was an ambulance paramedics comment that there was quite a party going on at the bathhouse and the narrators statement that carter was a victim from the bathhouse party
4992501 in furtherance of their free speech rights in connection with the public issue of substance abuse and emergency medical treatment
4992502 individually identifiable information in possession of or derived from a provider of health care regarding a patients medical history mental or physical condition or treatment

4992505 because the marketing of the videotape to cable operators is part of dcis process of disseminating information to the public

4992514 a s long as bianchi raised a reasonable inference that he was protesting conduct outlawed by title vii he has met his burden
4992515 the oncale court extended the statutory proscriptions of title vii to same sex harassment even though such harassment was assuredly not the principal evil that congress was concerned with when it enacted title vii and there is no principled basis for construing title ix more grudgingly
4992516 that evidence of actions or statements reflecting a decision makers prejudice are admissible even if they are not directly connected to the employment decision title vii bars discrimination based on a womans non conformance with socially constructed gender expectations citing price waterhouse v hopkins and rippys comments were reflective of an attitude that menchaca was too tough and thus did not conform to traditional sexual stereotypes the evidence was unquestionably relevant
4992517 but rule 403 concerns only unfair prejudice and there was nothing unfair about the prejudice to amri from this evidence which concerned the attitude and intent of a decision maker and even if the prejudice was somehow unfair it was far outweighed by the strong probative value of the evidence
4992518 slapping on the side of the legs and sometimes in the crotch area
4992519 a sufficient basis for the trial court to infer that the contact was done for the purpose of arousing or gratifying mcintyres sexual desire

4992532 a person who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to others in the workplace will not be otherwise qualified for his or her job if reasonable accommodation will not eliminate the risk
4992533 death itself makes the risk significant evidence of actual transmission of the fatal disease in the relevant context is not necessary to a finding of significant risk
4992534 none of waddells medical experts appear to dispute that transmission could happen even though such an event never before has occurred

4992640 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4992641 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up

4992676 cheese is generally considered as quite indigestible and therefore to be avoided by all those who have not very strong stomachs if however a very little good cheese be taken in conjunction with other proper substances as bread or rice as a mere condiment it can hardly be considered as positively hurtful to those who are very vigorous a stronger objection to its use is that it is too concentrated a substance or too pure a nutriment i have spoken however of good cheese only bad cheese is among the worst of eatables cheese is even sometimes poisonous i have known nearly a hundred persons poisoned at once by eating from a certain cheese other instances of the kind have occurred i do not know that the cause of this phenomenon has ever been detected some have supposed it to be a vegetable poison as the lobelia or the hemlock eaten by the cows the anatto or otto so frequently used to give color to cheese is slightly poisonous but there is another more striking method of poisoning cheese which has been discovered very recently some of our dairy women have fallen into the habit of adding a small quantity of arsenic ratsbane say a piece half as large as a small pea to each large cheese especially when made in part of old milk the object is to give it freshness and tenderness and the plan is said to succeed admirably but it produces or may produce great injury to the human constitution and some persons have been made immediately sick by it my greatest objection after all to the use of butter and cheese both grows out of the consideration that their manufacture involves a great amount of female labor while no permanent or substantial benefit is obtained what can be more valuable than female labor applied to the physical and moral management and early instruction of children if cheese is to be eaten at all let it be eaten rather new than old and let it be well masticated do not eat grated cheese nor should it be toasted toasting though with many a favorite process only renders cheese more indigestible

4992681 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
4992682 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations

4992684 tres medallas en tres juegos ol mpicos y no tengo mucho que decir m s por fin tengo una medalla ol mpica de suelo aunque no sea oro pero tampoco es un bronce que me habr a jodido m s
4992685 era muy complicado sacar medalla era pr cticamente imposible si dragui e hyp lito no hubieran fallado estar amos muy ah y somos cuatro gimnastas para tres puestos
4992686 la gente discute mi forma de entrenar a los hechos me remito si luego me va bien he trabajado muy duro para esto las he pasado canutas en madrid y aqu este es el resultado
4992687 yo de momento sigo cuando me retire ya os lo dir no me ech is todav a que de momento voy ganando medallas espero poder estar en londres en forma sin ning n tipo de lesi n grave
4992688 nervios al ver a dragulescu trabucarse de culo y luego al ver a hyp lito he pensado que no puede estar pasando esto ahora s lo falta que caiga el chino y que me den la medalla
4992689 luego el chino ha competido muy bien adem s estando en casa a m me ha parecido que le han puntuado un poco alto pero yo tampoco he hecho un ejercicio mejor que l as que estoy contento tres juegos tres medallas
4992690 la sensaci n de que iba a ser m s complicado que en los otros juegos
4992691 m s tiempo para pensar ponerse nervioso fallar de todo e iba a ser m s complicado
4992692 ten a un sentimiento de ansiedad y los he visto fallar a ellos y he pensado les pasa lo mismo que a m no han soportado la presi n y pens que ten a que hacer mi ejercicio de suelo que he hecho millones de veces estoy s per preparado para hacerlo y ya tengo que hacer simplemente mi trabajo
4992693 es lo mejor pero hoy viendo que estaba ah la posibilidad de medalla se me ha puesto cuesta arriba un poco primero he visto la nota y no sab a si era segundo y tercero y he tenido que mirar la nota
4992694 es joven y le cuesta asimilar estas cosas estaba muy metido en s mismo
4992695 dragu cuando ha visto que no ten a posiblidades me ha dicho venga gervi que t puedes dale duro que puedes ganar f cil

4992699 more and more information is electronic and so to have a hole in our policy that we couldnt treat electronics in the same way as others would create a very ironic hole in our ability to prevent dangerous materials coming into this country
4992700 this is similar to russainhaxors thread only it contains the fundamentals
4992701 and ive got some people hurt we cant play everybody here in this hot weather in august especially in places like atlanta where you play a doubleheader and then here
4992702 you better rotate your team we dont want to be empty after labor day so weve got to keep our team and fresh
4992703 i had a good friend who called who has watched us play and he said boy your teams got some swagger
4992704 id never thought of that and it made me feel good i got choked up when he told me that thats what you want your teams got a little swagger
4992705 no hes been that way for seven years and for six years its been six pretty good years
4992706 hes hit for power hes hit home runs and hes pitched well during those stretches where hes hit so i dont really know if theres a major connection
4992707 he focuses on what he needs to do to pitch hes a good pitcher and when he comes out of it hell come out of it in a big way
4992708 it might be a tick low we probably need to get him back over the rubber a little bit so he can gather and get back on top i think from the stretch he was being too quick and that doesnt give his arm time to get up
4992709 what weve been trying to do with jason knowing the last few years hes struggled in august and september were spacing him out a little more
4992710 i hope he appreciates it because thats what were trying to do to get him to finish nice and strong i think its having a positive effect as opposed to pitching him every five days
4992711 to win a gold medal is unbelievable i have been dreaming of this moment since i was eight years old i dont even want to think about the us open i want to enjoy this moment
4992712 if he is not careful we could be known in the future as mr and mrs nick ayton

4992737 were bringing in equipment that will be age appropriate for our residents here previously royal oaks met exercise needs as where it was in the industry in the world for this age group
4992738 but were smart by recognizing that that has changed royal oaks is far ahead of any other non profit lifecare community here we started designing a health and fitness center here and its going to be state of the art
4992739 we did not have a strength training area at all in the previous exercise room
4992740 were going to have a whole area in the fitness center devoted to strength training
4992741 were going to be having strength equipment like what westcott talked about were going to have cardio equipment were going to have stretching areas were going to have a fitness center thats about 1 800 square feet tai chi yoga an indoor swimming pool outdoor walking pool a jacuzzi meditation rooms
4992742 im here to share with you that strength training is the key to reversing the negative processes that we associate with sedentary behavior

4992763 the idealistic impulse toward protecting individuals from overbearing state authority has resulted in a system where we deny people the opportunity to take responsibility for their criminal acts in our system a man or woman who takes responsibility must be crazy
4992764 t here is little evidence that a significant number of guilty people are going free because of the miranda warning the chief reason for this is that contrary to expectations most people under arrest do not keep their mouths shut and do not ask for a lawyer even though it is almost always in their interest to do so
4992765 our citizens confidence in the criminal justice system will be strengthened by ensuring that the rules will be fair to crime victims as well as suspects will protect the public by helping convict those who voluntarily confess their guilt and will promote honesty and accuracy in criminal trials by allowing the jury to hear all truthful evidence a society that beats confessions out of suspects has lost its morals but a society that rejects a suspects voluntarily given confession has lost its marbles
4992766 when people around the world go to the movies they see a bad guy who has just murdered a nun impaled a policeman and blown up a school collared by eastwood or stallone or tommy lee jones what are the first words out of the good guys mouth you have the right to remain silent the viewer has to wonder what kind of political paradise america really is people seeing this in belgrade and harare and kuala lumpur places where the innocent get whacked and beaten and tortured at the whim of the authorities can only be awestruck at a country that treats even its monsters with such delicacy
4992767 who invokes their right to remain silent or especially their right to counsel the usual suspects the hardened criminals the ones who have been through the system many times before or who come into it well heeled and well counseled these offenders dont need the warnings to understand their rights and they are quick to assert them for all the rest miranda amounts to little more than red tape just another part of the ritual of putting on the handcuffs and making the trip to the station miranda does little if anything to protect the most vulnerable suspects
4992768 in the common view miranda was necessary to protect accused criminals from being forced to confess through coercion or torture
4992769 unless miranda warnings are a totally impotent gesture there must be some percentage of suspects who invoke their right to remain silent who would not have done so some subset of that group in turn presumably would have gone on to make truthful confessions that would not have been involuntary in the classic beaten out of him sense and in some subcategory of that subset the confession would have been crucial to building a case against that suspect

4992837 the country will achieve about 35 40 billion dollar in the current fiscal the first quarter has crossed 10 billion dollar last year it was 24 billion dollar for the entire fiscal
4992838 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobodymentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4992839 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growthyear on year and they are out to sustain that not least becausetheir senior managements earnings are related to the shareprice
4992840 its not in their interests to take less profit personallyas well as from the point of view of the business all theseperverse incentives drive the price up

4992854 the new service also includes priority check in dedicated cabin crew an additional hand baggage allowance and priority boarding and disembarkation
4992855 the fact is that fuel prices are something we have no control over so we have to look harder at areas where we do have control
4992856 despite our fuel hedging strategy fuel surcharges two separate across the board fare increases and a recruitment freeze we are not bridging the widening gap between the actual increase in the cost of fuel and the amount we offset
4992857 this will enable us to make significant changes to domestic and international flying for both qantas and jetstar in some cases this will involve pulling off routes entirely in other cases we will scale back frequencies and capacity
4992858 wherever possible we have tried to minimise the overall impact of the changes

4992890 if 300 people are taken to denvers temporary detention facility within a short time frame processing those persons at the rate of 30 to 50 per hour would take at least 6 to 10 hours
4992891 during the republican national convention in new york city in 2004 nearly 1 100 people were arrested in a four hour period if a similar situation occurred in denver it would take at least 22 to 36 hours to process those persons
4992892 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4992893 at the temporary facility denver will of course also be required to provide for detainees basic human needs such as adequate food and drinking water access to toilets and facilities for washing and access to medical care if necessary
4992894 detainees must also be allowed the opportunity for bodily movement including release from handcuffs or flexicuffs
4992895 denver must establish a system to ensure that detainees are assured of access to medically necessary prescription medications they may be taking some arrestees will need prescription medications that are in the possession of family members who were not arrested denver will have to arrange a system to receive the medications from family members and then deliver them to the appropriate prisoner failure to deliver appropriate and necessary medications could result in serious deterioration and damage to a detainees health
4992896 this facility will not be used for long term detention
4992897 arrestees who are processed at this facility will be there for no more than the few hours it requires for processing water bathrooms medical staff and phones will be available to them the facility will be fully staffed to ensure its safe and secure operation

4992900 the book is never quite as good but the only people who might see a difference are the austen enthusiasts and scholars they would notice the slight dulling and lack of vitality but unable to come to a satisfactory answer as to why this might be so they will simply blame themselves a reading later in the week will once again renew their confidence in the magnificence of the novel

4992908 tiger has had to re allocate its resources to meet the demand in its next stage of growth tiger airways spokesman matt hobbs said in a statement
4992909 these people speculators and hedge funds buy oil futures and say that this or that event may cause an oil shortage
4992910 not very long after this people react to this and by then the message would be there is a shortage of supply even though there is none
4992911 first look at the oil tankers at sea if they are not moving and just floating out at sea that means they have no crude or processed oil to transport that is not happening and that means there is no shortage
4992912 second go to the petrol stations if there are long queues that means there is a shortage again this is not happening and this can only mean there is more than enough supply
4992913 as an ex oilman i tell you there is no shortage
4992914 i always believe in the brick and mortar something i can touch these people are trading with nothing
4992915 many years ago we at shell had wanted to buy enron i was leading the team then and we hired over 60 consultants to study how a company with no oil fields refineries or gas stations could make so much money
4992916 one of the consultants tried to convince me to recommend to the shell bosses to buy enron but i said no because i could not touch what they were trading in

4992919 if jet fuel were to stay at current levels for several years and virgin blue could not significantly increase fares it would not survive jp morgan analysts matthew crowe and russell crichton brown wrote in a note
4992920 we are considering a range of options which may include capacity reductions redeployment of aircraft fare reviews and several other initiatives not just the single demand side lever of fare reviews as the jpmorgan report suggested
4992921 just as importantly the supply side should be considered in any economic argument
4992922 in the airline business you have two choices today you can decide to do something or you can sit and pray that fuel is going to go back to 100 or 80
4992923 the things were looking at are reductions in capacity further cash management
4992924 were looking at what we can do in terms of redeploying planes into different more profitable markets

4992929 he said i can do any job going i said weve got only one job going at the moment and thats as a bouncer on the door and he said thats fine
4992930 harry adores going to lesotho he can just go to a bar for a few beers with his army pals and relax he was so determined to get a t shirt and be a doorman for the evening brian couldnt turn him down
4992931 during the two week trip harry also borrowed ten pounds from sables to buy a round for his colleagues from the blues and royals regiment
4992932 harry was sitting there wondering who was paying for the next round he came up to me and said eh ive got no money just lend me a tenner

4992939 there stood the speaker before his listeners inspired and filled to the very core with the marvelous ideals ideengut and thoughts of the national socialist worldview and he strove to transfer this inspiration this devotion this faith that he carried within himself to transfer that to his listeners and make them loyal national socialists a thousand ways it was proved true that often it was not so much the contents of speech as it was the manner in which it was delivered that influenced the listener and won him to us indeed a speech could even be poor and yet create a success in such cases the audience had to recognize and feel that there stood a man who lived utterly according to the ideals gedankengut about which he spoke a man who was totally and completely inspired by faith in what he said just as faith can move mountains so can faith triumph over resistance and opposition

4992957 the lower manhattan initiative is expected to be in place by 2010

4992963 the cprfs program is an honest reflection of what independent polls show according to an ongoing study by the levada center a steady 34 48 of respondents support a soviet model of government nearly twice as many as those that support a western style democracy
4992964 after the georgia regimes attack on the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali the world should fully understand why russia would recognize the independence of ossetia and abkhazia and enter into security alliances that would reliably guarantee the security of the long suffering populations of these republics
4992965 now everything should be done to break the aggressor punish the guilty in an act of aggression war crimes and crimes of genocide provide effective assistance to victims begin to rebuild south ossetia
4992966 we must immediately recognize south ossetia and abkhazia and take them under their protection
4992967 not coincidentally western media during the first night didnt notice the invasion of georgian troops in south ossetia and the un security council refused to consider our appeal regarding aggression ostensibly because it was too late and members of the council very much like to sleep
4992968 but the council quickly awakened once russian tanks went through the tunnel and our aviation began to strike at georgian aggressors
4992969 they just need to make noise otherwise the damage to u s prestige will be even more sensitive
4992970 its worth noting that there are far more uncommitted voters at this point in election 2008 than there were four years ago

4992978 theres things that you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil they are talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
4992979 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
4992980 it takes a small mind to be able to spell something only one way
4992981 barack says we need to have a conversation about race in america
4992982 im going to vote for obama because hell end the war
4992983 we all need to do whatever it takes to get him elected
4992984 the goal of poverty reduction with other internationally recognized millennium development goals
4992985 the u s constitution not only limits federal jurisdiction over children the u s supreme court has held that to some significant degree no government federal state or local may interfere with the parent child relationship
4992986 squeeze my lemon until the juice runs down may leg
4992987 a revelation exposure to others takes away the positive mirror of opinion that they must have in order to keep their inner demons from themselves
4992988 an african american businessman from chicago calls in to a radio station to complain about barack hussein obama
4992989 have we capitulated have the american citizens who awarded his opponent the majority of popular votes during the primary contest just fallen into line as silently as sheep
4992990 you know im doing my best to support him but insert the latest gaffe is really giving me a hard time
4992991 i hope we can get through this but somehow i think it is more serious than im willing to admit
4992992 oh yeah thats right i almost forgot change ya know bubbie im so sick and tired of you people saying that word over and over and over again like a broken record keep the damned change im voting for mccain
4992993 she earned a round of applause from the others waiting on line and this being in my own very liberal elitist upper west side enclave where i thought id be hard pressed to find kindred spirits im proud again to be an upper west sider now i want to find that crusty old broad and bring her to the local starbucks for a treat wonder what shell come out with there
4992994 if i truly am being naive and misguided i ask you a favor as a fellow american to set me straight
4992995 if someone was threatening my family or my interests i might want to find out why to see if i could prevent it and talking to them in the right context and with the right preparations would be a reasonable method for doing that
4992996 if he is not campaigning for their support why is it a problem that hamas would support him
4992997 they are already running their country why do they need validity validity from who
4992998 if talking to them can get them to agree to negotiate and stand down from threatening positions who cares if they are all of sudden
4992999 the is nothing anti white about united states of kkk this statement is suggesting that america is anti black
4993000 also saying that hillary has never been called the n word is not anti white
4993001 but you could easily balance this by meeting with the opposition as well
4993002 im not going to argue racially insensitive vs racist with you if you ever actually experience racism you will know the difference
4993003 also bonus points for linking me to barack obama actually calling someone racist just for opposing him because im pretty sure that hasnt happened
4993004 just a quick question does his lose of the popular vote include voters from michigan and florida because if so with the controversy surrounding these states you would have to admit that the candidates did not campaign on level ground so it is a bit imprecise to consider this the popular vote
4993005 oh the surge worked i was right and if i was right to use it in iraq i can use it in afghanistan
4993006 should depend solely on the situation at hand in the current campaign which is basic military strategy
4993007 this suggests to me that senator mccain doesnt understand some of the fundamental differences between the battlefields in iraq and afghanistan much like he apparently doesnt understand the difference between shiite and sunni
4993008 we must use the same strategy that succeeded in iraq in afghanistan
4993009 i dont agree that obama isnt capable because we dont know his capabilities as has been stated a number of times he is unproven but we dont know whether this means he cant do the job or whether he can
4993010 if you really want the best for your country you will speak out when it is in the wrong
4993011 i try to stay away from jumping to conclusions in judging peoples motives
4993012 i dont know how big of a silent underground there is but there definitely is one
4993013 if thats the case im pulling out all the stops they already know who we are so why bother being coy
4993014 over the last week barack obama made time in his busy schedule to hold a rally with 200 000 germans in berlin hold a press conference with french president nicholas sarkozy in paris and hold a solo press conference in front of 10 downing street in london the obama campaign had also scheduled a visit with wounded u s troops at ramstein air base in germany but this stop was canceled after it became clear that campaign staff and the traveling press corps would not be allowed to accompany senator obama
4993015 yea right 6 days on a tour makes him a president then i guess the beatles should have been president too
4993016 we had a republican house how was i do get past them
4993017 have the courage to do what is right i am positive that senator mccain is the type of leader who will do what he thinks is right for our country i think obama has an entirely different agenda
4993018 what it showed me is you are not an agent of change because to really change things in this place you have to get beat up now and then
4993019 the wrong person with the right methods will get you the wrong results but the right person with the wrong methods will get you the right results
4993020 ill tell you something else im gonna go out on a limb you know this prayer when he went to the western wall and he writes this prayer out and he sticks it in the wall and then some jewish student comes along supposedly goes digging around in there and finds it and releases it and everybody is up in arms over the invasion of privacy i would not be surprised and we will probably not learn this that whole thing is a campaign trick that that note was written to be discovered that note that prayer was written to be found because ill tell you this party and obama himself are as cynical as it takes to get where they want to go and if it is ever learned that this whole thing was part of a plan hell they had campaign signs up there at the western wall a sacred shrine for crying out loud if i learn that this whole thing was done as part of a plan and by the way i dont think the student is known has he announced his name hes being secretive about some things but this is just a little too you know with all the sensitivity this campaign has and you know they have it about whether or not hes a muslim you know that stuff bugs them it really bugs em what better way to dispense with that and in jeremiah wright and farrakhan and all these other associations that he has finding that little prayer it could go a long way toward showing all those claims that hes not really a christian by the way none of thats been stated on this program im just telling you what the campaign is concerned about but i believe these people and mccain is right theyll do whatever it takes to win an election
4993021 maybe the israelis will try something because of obamas policy on israel which the zionists dont like but we will certainly protect obama we are professional security forces
4993022 he is a gift from the world to us in so many ways
4993023 before i was nine i had learned the basic canon of arab life it was me against my brother me and my brother against our father my family against my cousins and the clan the clan against the tribe and the tribe against the world and all of us against the infidel
4993024 news that barack hussein obama will be protected by the well known terrorist group al aqsa martyrs brigade
4993025 by some accounts the hells angels were hired as security by the rolling stones on recommendation from the grateful dead for 500 worth of beer
4993026 it was not clear if blair would plan another visit to the gaza strip following the hamas police security arrangement
4993027 at todays press conference barack obama said that the u s senates banking committee is his committee which will surely come as a surprise to the chairman of the banking housing and urban affairs committee christopher dodd an obama sycophant
4993028 not only is it not his committee but hes not even on the committee he didnt vote on the bill and he had nothing to do with its passage
4993029 they helped him get the third reich on the road
4993030 you have been deeply involved in this miracle that has blossomed and we are extraordinarily grateful not just as americans but as world citizens for your outstanding service to your country
4993031 obama told president abbas if he wins the election in the united states he will be a full and positive partner in the peace process and will not lose a single moment in pursuing it
4993032 he supports a peaceful solution to the israeli palestinian conflict and said from the first moment of his presidency he will be a very important partner in the peace process
4993033 it is a very difficult process there is a lot of history that exists between those two people that history is not going to vanish overnight he said in jordan
4993034 largely because it is so tangible and exciting a program and as such will serve to keep alive the interest and enthusiasm of the whole spectrum of society it is justified because the program can give a sense of shared adventure and achievement to the society at large
4993035 one thing they dont tell you about doing experimental physics is that sometimes you must work under adverse conditions like a state of sheer terror
4993036 forgive me my sins and help me guard against pride and despair give me the wisdom to do what is right and just and make me an instrument of your will
4993037 barack obamas note was approved for publication in the international media even before he put in the kotel a short time after he wrote it at the king david hotel in jerusalem
4993038 since obama is not a jew publishing the note does not constitute an infringement on his right to privacy
4993039 i am highly educated in religious matters and i knew that since i am a gentile my prayer could be published without a problem
4993040 do not be deceived god cannot be mocked a man reaps what he sows the one who sows to please his sinful nature from that nature will reap destruction the one who sows to please the spirit from the spirit will reap eternal life
4993041 what can i say your prayer is so heartfelt your words are so precious that you touched me deep in the recesses of my
4993042 if he truly meant this as a photo op then that is rather disingenuous
4993043 just eat your meat or you wont get any pudding
4993044 oh yeah thats right the rules only apply to people who dont agree with you and of course thats not hypocritical at all im sorry i was wrong
4993045 jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves 13 it is written
4993046 my house will be called a house of prayer e but you are making it a den of robbers
4993047 no i have no intention of running in 2008 i wont have enough experience by then
4993048 i read your posts and i see attempts to sound sincere but underneath i see the same old lines
4993049 well im done now so feel free to flame away
4993050 associations that should have stopped him from being a senator let alone potus
4993051 once again i am not an obama supporter either i see and dislike many of the same things about him that you see and dislike but i also see many things about senator mccain that i dislike as well which make me like him as little or less
4993052 im becoming more and more concerned that the republicans also dont want to do anything that will stop this volcano from erupting
4993053 the commentators suggested that this may be due to older female hillary supporters who would rather support mccain than obama
4993054 do not worry about the silence we are still out there
4993055 with the road rising up to meet you and the wind behind your back
4993056 btw did you know that mccain even has better integrity on womens issues his staff includes women in key positions unlike bho and he pays those same women better that bho does
4993057 i carve his name on the bottoms of my shoes and piss on the imprint in the dirt
4993058 youll have to measure time by before obama and after obama
4993059 obama is a lightworker an attuned being with powerful luminosity and high vibration integrity who will actually help usher in a new way of being
4993060 the event itself is so extraordinary that another chapter could be added to the bible to chronicle its significance
4993061 his story exemplifies the quest of the solar hero does it not feel some special hand is guiding his journey
4993062 hes running a theological campaign at some point he took off his arms and grew wings
4993063 ill do whatever he says to do ill collect paper cups off the ground to make his pathway clear
4993064 this is bigger than kennedy this is the new testament
4993065 obamas finest speeches do not excite they do not inform they dont even really inspire they elevate he is not the word made flesh but the triumph of word over flesh obama is at his best able to call us back to our highest selves
4993066 were here to evolve to a higher plane he is an evolved leader
4993067 i would characterize the senate race as being a race where obama was lets say blessed and highly favored thats not routine theres something else going on i think that obama his election to the senate was divinely ordered i know that that was gods plan
4993068 bono this is our moment this is our time this is our chance to stand up for whats right were not looking for charity were lookin for justice obama people of berlin people of the world this is our moment this is our time rush there you have it ladies and gentlemen obama plagiarizing bono he also plagiarizes deval patrick the governor of massachusetts
4993069 what have i done besides sit around and bitch all day
4993070 want to wake up on november 5 and know regardless of the result that i personally did all that i could to ensure that bho is not our next cic
4993071 they will wait until after the convention but then it may be too late thats what i want them to see
4993072 this is how we feel as former dems this is what we think about the issues this is what we might be willing to do for you and your candidate now what are you going to do for us are you willing to earn our votes or will you throw us under your own bus right after the election
4993073 a mccain win is not guaranteed and to me time is being lost every day that they dont speak up and tell the truth they will wait until after the convention but then it may be too late thats what i want them to see
4993074 yep youre feeling just like i did the first time i posted comments
4993075 denise to you think it would be appropriate to repost his post for everyone else to see
4993076 i would love to read an article written for and submitted to this site by commander roulstone
4993077 we have to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in
4993078 obama and john mccain who has endorsed the build up should before committing any more combat brigades explain how and when this war ends in an american victory
4993079 today candor compels us to admit that our vaunted two party system is a snare and a delusion a fraud upon the nation
4993080 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
4993081 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
4993082 having spent two years as the command sergeant major at landstuhl hospital i am always grateful for the attention that facility receives from members of congress
4993083 senator obama has explained his decision to cancel a scheduled visit there by blaming the military which would not allow one of his political advisers to join him in a tour of the facility why senator obama felt he needed an adviser with him to visit u s troops is unclear but if senator obama isnt comfortable meeting wounded american troops without his entourage perhaps he does not have the experience necessary to serve as commander in chief
4993084 why didnt mr obama leave his aides behind even the retired general and make the visit by himself
4993085 it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obamas piece to that end the article would have to articulate in concrete terms how senator mccain defines victory in iraq im not going to be able to accept this piece as currently written
4993086 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there
4993087 our troops have performed brilliantly in lowering the level of violence
4993088 iraq has met all but three of 18 original benchmarks set by congress last year to measure security political and economic progress
4993089 republican senator chuck hagel has ties to the largest voting machine company election systems amp software es amp s located in omaha nebraska es amp s was the only company whose machines counted hagels votes when he ran for election in 1996 and 2002 es amp s counts approximately 60 percent of all votes cast in the united states according to the omaha world herald which is also a beneficial owner of es amp s hagel was ceo of american information systems now called es amp s from november 1993 through june 2 1994 he was chairman from july 1992 until march 15 1995 hagel still owns up to 5 million in the es amp s parent company mccarthy group he was required to disclose these positions on his fec personal disclosure statements but he did not this is clearly a potential conflict of interest
4993090 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
4993091 unmarried women are to progressives what evangelicals are to the conservative movement
4993092 womens average incomes are also slightly lower and less likely to vary over time which gives single women an incentive to prefer more progressive income taxes once women get married however they bear a greater share of taxes through their husbands relatively higher incomes so their support for high taxes understandably declines marriage also provides an economic explanation for why men and women prefer different policies because women generally shoulder most of the child rearing responsibilities married men are more likely to acquire marketable skills that help them earn money outside the household if a man gets divorced he still retains these skills but if a woman gets divorced she is unable to recoup her investment in running the household hence single women who believe they may marry in the future as well as married women who most fear divorce look to the government as a form of protection against this risk from a possible divorce a more progressive tax system and other government transfers of wealth from rich to poor the more certain a woman is that she doesnt risk divorce the more likely she is to oppose government transfers
4993093 yeah i think hillary would be the first pick if i was ever going to consider a democrat as a vp
4993094 troubled by the use of private contractors when it comes to potential armed engagements
4993095 there is room for private contractors to work in the mess hall providing basic supplies and doing some logistical work
4993096 we have one candidate who essentially is telling us every day that the world as it is just fine that what weve been doing for the last eight years is fine
4993097 and then we have this other candidate barack obama who is saying every day that the world as it is not right its not good enough
4993098 i wish we had time to be divided i wish we had time to be upset to be angry to be disappointed i wish we did
4993099 because if we had time for that then things wouldnt be so bad right now instead were in a place where another four or eight years of the world as it is will devastate the life of some child
4993100 oh yeah i saw where michelle is convinced that american children will face disaster if her husband isnt elected president
4993101 michelle is convinced that american children will face disaster if her husband isnt elected president
4993102 i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war senator obama would rather lose a war to win a political campaign i am ready for the job i have the qualifications i dont need on the job training
4993103 people are saying that senator obamas recent changes of position have made him a flip flopper hes not flip floppers only hold one position at a time senator obama is different he holds two positions at the same time both ways on banning handguns both ways on public campaign financing and now both ways on withdrawing from iraq hes both ways barack worse than a flip flopper
4993104 israel is a strong friend of israels it will be a strong friend of israels under a mccain administration it will be a strong friend of israels under an obama administration so that policy is not going to change
4993105 polls hillary does better than mccain and obama in kentucky and fl oh pa
4993106 barack obama made the first mistake of his trip in my judgment in releasing a statement in which he said exactly what maliki had said in those conversations
4993107 what presidential candidate in their right mind would possibly agree to accept protection from a recognized and globally condemned terrorist organization
4993108 theres something there that just doesnt seem right to me because in a sense youre saying then that the officials who pass the laws are not willing to live by them and that concerns me
4993109 hes such a great orator such a great communicator the guy just penetrates you with his oratory and his language
4993110 after we confronted him about seeing rielle edwards looked like a deer caught in headlights
4993111 he was clearly surprised that we had caught him at this very late hour inside the hotel
4993112 some guests up at this late hour watched the spectacle in amusement from a staircase nearby
4993113 theres nothing dishonorable in a person rethinking his or her positions especially in a constantly changing political context barack obama contradicts and threatens everything i believe about the institution of the family and what is best for the nation his radical positions on life marriage and national security force me to reevaluate the candidacy of our only other choice john mccain
4993114 as it was foretold it will be a cold day in hell before true religious conservatives support a man who advocates for partial birth abortion and believes that we should appease muslim terrorists
4993115 in other news james dobson the very well known and influential evangelical leader has finally hinted that he may end up endorsing john mccain after all since the start of mccains campaign he clearly stated that he would not endorse mccain a fact that had many democrats predicting that this would be the end of mccains bid for the presidency and that it would simultaneously pave the way for obama to win in november in a landslide
4993116 all of the questions in recent weeks on whether or not barack obama is shifting positions becoming a typical politician is turning some of them off
4993117 a full length feature documentary that goes beyond the media adulation surrounding barack obama s meteoric and unexamined rise to the national spotlight the film features dozens of interviews and untold stories from the earliest beginnings of his political career in chicago to his brief stint as a u s senator through today
4993118 sen barack obama d ill s one day drive by visit with iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki may have have been meant to
4993119 obamas visit got only a vague mention on the local tv networks afternoon news hours and it failed to make the front page on any of iraqs top newspapers
4993120 obama wants to prove that hes qualified enough to be commander in chief
4993121 i believe with all my soul that racism and racism alone will be blamed above anything or anyone else when he loses that has been his mo from day one wv and ky is a good reference point to start with
4993122 he had never met obama and did not know him
4993123 ich bin sicher dass einige kennedy posen rekonstruiert werden von hinten gefilmt vor vielen menschen und dahinter das brandenburger tor das w re wieder eine seiner politischen spitzenleistungen
4993124 i am certain that some kennedy poses will be reconstructed
4993125 die siegess ule in berlin wurde von adolf hitler vom reichstag weg auf ihren heutigen platz gestellt sie war f r ihn das symbol deutscher berlegenheit und siegreicher kriege gegen d nemark sterreich und frankreich mir stellt sich die frage ob barack obama richtig beraten war die siegess ule als rede ort f r seine visionen einer welt der zusammenarbeit zu w hlen
4993126 the victory column in berlin was placed in its current location by adolph hitler who moved it from its original position in front of the reichstag it was for him the symbol of german superiority and victorious wars against denmark austria and france for myself the question arises whether barack obama was properly advised to select the victory column as the speech location for his visions of one world of cooperation
4993127 there are three competing translations of iraqi prime minister nuri now infamous remarks to the german magazine der spiegel about the potential withdrawal of u s troops from iraq david knowles provides the new york times version
4993128 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
4993129 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
4993130 before i was nine i had learned the basic canon of arab life it was me against my brother me and my brother against our father my family against my cousins and the clan the clan against the tribe and the tribe against the world and all of us against the infidel
4993131 this is an example of some of the problems we get into when somebody attacks you for saying the truth which is we should want our children with more knowledge we should want our children to have more skills theres nothing wrong with that thats a good thing i know because i dont speak a foreign language its embarrassing
4993132 i can speak bahasi indonesian but i dont think there would be a lot of appeal to that
4993133 with less than six months to go before he would be sworn in as the nations 44th president sen barack obama has directed his aides to begin planning for the transition barack is well aware of the complexity and the organizational challenge involved in the transition process and he has tasked s sic small group to begin thinking through the process a senior campaign adviser said barack has made his expectations clear about what he wants from such a process how he wants it to move forward and the establishment and execution of his timeline is proceeding apace a campaign spokesperson confirmed that transition planning had begun but would provide no further details an adviser said that the campaign wants to keep the process as low profile as possible in order to minimize distractions
4993134 a public announcement is planned for the fall given the myriad challenges that will face the next president barack would encourage sen mccain to begin to undertake a similar process the adviser said
4993135 it is not going to be a political speech said a senior foreign policy adviser who spoke to reporters on background when the president of the united states goes and gives a speech it is not a political speech or a political rally but he is not president of the united states a reporter reminded the adviser
4993136 carrie budoff brown reports from the flight from amman to tel aviv obama aides were reminded by reporters for the second time today that he isnt in the white house yet and therefore they cant invoke white house rules and traditions an unpaid foreign policy adviser who worked for clinton told reporters that he never in his four years in the white house had go on the record for a briefing several reporters retorted that they werent in the white house
4993137 when john mccormick reported obama replaced his boeing 737 campaign plane with a boeing 757 he noted the new aircraft had a giant flag painted on its tail in yet another display of his patriotism obama replaced the american flag with the obama logo lynn sweet reports that obamas 757 has been repainted with the obama sunrise logo on the tail oh the audacity of obamas ego
4993138 at a discussion with a dozen democratic governors in chicago on friday morning each of the governors was identified with a small name plate but senator barack obama sat behind a low rostrum to which was attached an official looking seal no one had seen before it is emblazoned with a fierce looking eagle clutching an olive branch in one claw and arrows in the other and is deliberately reminiscent of the official seal of the president of the united states
4993139 but barack obamas crowd has decided not to wait for any of the formalities like a presidential election an inauguration or even a nomination which he still hasnt actually officially won yet
4993140 wrapping up in presidency by 2016 translation obama believes the presidency is owed to him excellent article jc i was amused at the mc hammer debacle while it was happening and believe me your comparison is right on the money and reading the list of his offensive tactics and arrogant statements has me working feverishly to finish my survivors manual
4993141 camp obama trainings offer a unique in depth look at the strategies and techniques that have driven this campaign camp obama trainings offer a unique in depth look at the strategies and techniques that have driven this campaign these two day sessions to be held august 15th 16th are led by experienced obama campaign staffers and other professional organizers who are eager to empower dedicated supporters like you after completing a camp session attendees will be asked to fill essential volunteer positions in battleground states these are demanding roles but they are a vital part of our election strategy supporters with experience in community organizing or political campaigns are strongly encouraged to apply but the only requirement is that you support barack and be ready to turn your enthusiasm and energy into action here are some of the skills youll learn at camp obama tactics that will help you creatively and effectively organize voters tips to increase the visibility of the campaign in your area keys to mobilizing other volunteers to join our movement
4993142 id love to give a speech in germany but id much prefer to do it as president of the united states rather than as a candidate
4993143 he is going to demand that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zones that you push yourselves to be better and that you engage
4993144 and it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the evil bush the younger the ignorant when the whole land from the arabian desert to the shores of the great lakes had been laid barren that a child appeared in the wilderness
4993145 i think part of the reason why bho voted for it is this he thinks he will probably be the next potus so hes totally for wiretapping into private citizens part of his agenda to invade in our lives to make sure we cant oppose him and very slowly and surely take away our rights to enforce his power
4993146 youre right sean thats the way campaigns are but now ive got to support the dem nominee therefore i wont stray from my talking points
4993147 senator obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event when his visit was to show his appreciation for our troops and decided instead not to go
4993148 by doing so he is priming voters to think about the very issues on which they prefer john mccain indeed his trip overseas was intended to portray him in a positive light on the world stage it has certainly done that but foreign policy isnt likely to drive many voting decisions in the fall barring a major international event as a result obamas best bet is to return home as soon as possible and start priming voters on the issue area he can dominate the economy
4993149 im a muslim i dont deny it my father was raised a muslim
4993150 people of berlin people of the world this is our time
4993151 i have no idea what obama stands for in fact none of us do but what does that matter we just cant help but stand up and shout for him
4993152 just like we used to do for you know who
4993153 we wanted to put him on a plane and send him the hell away
4993154 now i understand how it must have felt at nuremberg
4993155 let our children come here and know this history so they can add their voices to proclaim never again and may we remember those who perished not only as victims but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed like us and who have become symbols of the human spirit
4993156 well look if thats the criteria by which we are making decisions on the deployment of u s forces then by that argument you would have 300 000 troops in the congo right now where millions have been slaughtered as a consequence of ethnic strife which we havent done
4993157 has not shown a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief
4993158 on labor day he was a favorite to be treasury secretary should john kerry win the white house at year end he had left under a cloud the charmed career of franklin d raines a poor kid from seattle who climbed through harvard and a rhodes scholarship to become white house budget director and ceo of fannie mae
4993159 jamie gorelicks ties to fannie mae and what shes doing now in reading this article about crony capitalism at fannie mae tip to instapundit i noticed that jamie gorelick was one of the fannie executives who benefited from inflated bonuses based on enron style accounting she was vice chairman of fannie mae from 1997 to 2003 fannies fraudulent accounting scheme was made public in 2004
4993160 the ap is totally in the tank for obama when you watch this video they have turned down the volume so you cant hear the hecklers too funny go to this website and you will have a much better idea of what was happening
4993161 may god stand between us and harm in all the empty places where we must walk
4993162 i am a german immigrant to the us please dont be fooled the previous poster claiming things are better in germany germanys unemployement is almost double that of the usa while gdp growth is lower also dont be fooled by large crowds in tiergarten most of these people are greens socialists unemployed and other social misfits they do not represents germany i will be getting my us citizenship soon and unlike the clowns in tiergarten i can cast a vote this fall and i will vote mccain gruss gott hermann
4993163 i think you were sleep deprived when you posted this one
4993164 he has no interest in anything but seeing how much money he can raise with his empty rhetoric
4993165 he was denied from harvard 4 times before affirmative action finally allowed him
4993166 im looking at this thing and im like what the hell is this
4993167 a book which shows clearly how jihadism has become a strategic threat to democracy worldwide
4993168 watch the senate floor more often you might learn something
4993169 when we have found somebody we will make a statement
4993170 oxfam fits very well in the middle of this changing attitude in the uk about values
4993171 may not be serving well the interests of either airlines or passengers
4993172 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and with stansted or with luton or manchester
4993173 desde el pasado 28 de julio directos del sindicato de vencedores socialistas sinvensoc y de un reducido grupo de trabajadores paralizaron
4993174 propinado agresiones y amenazas contra trabajadores as como da os a los veh culos equipos maquinarias y materiales de propiedad privada
4993175 considerando que las condiciones no est n dadas para asegurar la protecci n f sica e integridad de los trabajadores invitamos a nuestra fuerza laboral a que se abstengan de trasladarse a la planta valencia y post venta este lunes 18 de agosto fecha en que estaba programado su retorno despu s del per odo de vacaciones colectivas
4993176 tras cuatro meses de negociaci n del contrato colectivo la empresa se muestra intransigente
4993177 operaciones de producci n de veh culos estaban detenidas por falta de material personal administrativo y obrero se hab a mantenido trabajando
4993178 en la actualidad nuestros problemas de material han sido solventados y nos encontramos listos para dar continuidad al compromiso que asumimos con venezuela hace 60 a os en tanto esta situaci n se resuelva
4993179 there might be a acc team with a better quarterback out there but i dont know if they have three quarterbacks as good as ours
4993180 mevrouw u rijdt hier op een snelweg en de minimum snelheid is hier 80 km h
4993181 ik zag een stukje terug een bord met a67 en nam aan dat ik hier maar 67 mocht rijden
4993182 wat is er meneer gaat het wat te snel voor u
4993183 por supuesto que la inestabilidad les preocupa a los paquistan es pero tampoco les interesa a los aliados occidentales de pakist n
4993184 los occidentales est n inc modos con la situaci n pues para ellos ninguno de los posibles remplazantes de musharraf representa la continuidad
4993185 se dan cuenta de que la presidencia fue estable solamente cuando los militares estuvieron en el poder o cuando estuvo en manos de un gobierno fuerte como el que pakist n tuvo en los a os 70 con zulfikar al bhutto
4993186 problemas del sistema pol tico paquistan y que corresponde a los paquistan es resolverlos
4993187 musharraf era la primera opci n de los occidentales pero ahora entendieron que tiene que marcharse
4993188 en medio de tanta incertidumbre hay poca gente que crea que alguien que no sea militar pueda dirigir esta guerra contra el terrorismo
4993189 la decisi n tomada por el estado es adecuada considerando la negativa por parte de yale para devolver un patrimonio que inclusive la national geographic ha reconocido como peruano
4993190 we know very well that the inguri hydropower plant supplies electricity to dozens of thousands of georgian and abkhaz homes and we are well aware that strategic facilities of this kind could be targeted in provocations and even terror attacks
4993191 no you wouldnt know what to do with me so take your look and yes my destiny she is a very special woman a modern woman unique i am proud to be hers i want the world to know
4993192 and look he is so happy you must be an excellent trainer and owner
4993193 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
4993194 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
4993195 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
4993196 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
4993197 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
4993198 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me
4993199 decker was calling me a chicken s mother f get out and i will beat your ass
4993200 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4993201 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4993202 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
4993203 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
4993204 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
4993205 it was a preserve born from their single minded objective of bringing god people and animals together in a natural setting
4993206 instincts intellect and feelings interact to form spontaneous natural behavior
4993207 it was a preserve born from their single minded objective of bringing god people and animals together in a natural setting
4993208 it is supposed to make the dogs mean and lean but actually they became very slouchy with balding patches all over yeah the tomatoes are real problem
4993209 why are these mean atheists out to get poor scientists who like to think outside the box and push the envelope and blah blah blah
4993210 as the studies with the carmelite nuns have demonstrated and this book will detail spiritual experiences are complex experiences like our experiences of human relationships they leave signatures in many parts of the brain that fact is consistent with though it does not by itself demonstrate that the experiencer contacts a reality outside herself the fact is materialism is stalled not only does it have no useful hypotheses for the human mind or spiritual experiences it is not close to developing any just beyond lies a great realm that cannot even be entered via materialism let alone explored but the good news is that in the absence of materialism there are hopeful signs that it can indeed be entered and explored with modern neuroscience non materialist neuroscience is not compelled to reject deny explain away or treat as problems all evidence that defies materialism that is convenient because current research is turning up a growing body of such evidence three examples addressed in this book are the psi effect near death experiences ndes and the placebo effect
4993211 in our view this does not represent a major problem since the phenomenological data indicate that the subjects actually experienced genuine mystical experiences during the mystical condition these mystical experiences felt subjectively different than those used to self induce a mystical state
4993212 in materialism consciousness is just a descriptor of certain brain states

4993214 there is nothing intrinsically incorrect about the investigation of strange mental phenomenon as long as it is not based on untestable anecdotal evidence and takes into account the proper controls

4993226 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4993227 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money

4993231 i will de popcorn every new venue i acquire it has a disproportionate influence on the space in terms of its overwhelming smell the cultural idea of it and the operational problems created by the mess it produces im not saying no popcorn is better than popcorn but i am saying there is no way in which it fits with the culturally sophisticated brand i wish to sell
4993232 popcorn is horrible stuff and i wont have it anywhere near my cinema its a form of junk food and that encourages junk entertainment its smell is all pervasive it makes huge amounts of mess and it distracts and annoys people intensely
4993233 popcorn is hateful stuff it is the anathema of everything i want the rex to be and the decision to ban it was one of the first i made its trashy it makes a mess and it smells the multiplexes have to sell it because their ambition is to make as much money as possible my ambition to make a night at the rex a glamorous dignified and civilised affair people dress up to come here its special popcorn isnt
4993234 popcorn itself is irrelevant this is all about elitism and being an essentially contrary person all it does is make me want to eat popcorn more than ever my choice of snack food has sod all to do with my level of intelligence or indeed sophistication popcorn has no inherent morality

4993239 by far the most terrifying film you will ever see
4993240 i ran the race the way i wanted to run it i wanted to go out pretty conservative and run on really strongly in the second half
4993241 i let them get away too much in the middle stages we thought it might have been a bit hotter
4993242 obviously a bit disappointed i thought i might have been a bit higher up there but the winners were just too good
4993243 i kept passing people and really backing myself in the second half im really proud of the way that i kept going even though i knew the other people were a long way ahead
4993244 its my first olympic marathon and ill take that to 2012 i did what i went out to do today
4993245 it was pretty thirsty work out there i was pretty happy with my time i was hoping to go out in 77min and went through half way just under that my second half was strong but i would have liked to have placed higher
4993246 it was quite humid i felt thirsty the whole time we had a good medical team we were sitting there icing up before the race
4993247 that was a bit of a tough gig i pinched a nerve in my back from 5km onwards so it was quite a long run
4993248 it was great to be part of it it was an awesome experience the course was fantastic it was so flat the conditions were great you couldnt fault anything
4993249 it was an awesome experience just to be part of it
4993250 many times i realised it wasnt going to be my day but i wanted to stick it out and finish no matter what
4993251 it was good to finally get a race in after a few weeks after monaco ive just been waiting to get out here ive been excited
4993252 after i finish the final ill look around at the atmosphere
4993253 my time was a bit slow tonight buts its ok it was just a heat ill see what happens in the semi
4993254 im just really focusing on what i have to do each race and its coming together nicely
4993255 they didnt have regulations on how you dispose of waste and all these things in those days
4993256 so they didnt build these mills with any of the environmental protections regulations today are tighter on uranium mills than probably any other chemical plant in world
4993257 the u s needs to have at least some degree of production to have security of supply
4993258 these are complex facilities and they require a lot of analysis on our part
4993259 but they also require a lot of design and preparation by the companies
4993260 if they take a look at technical protections built into this mill theyll realize virtually this thing is benign when it comes to environment

4993264 action to preserve the remaining areas of natural forest is needed urgently
4993265 around 700 thousand tonnes per year each year tasmanias forests are absorbing 24 of the entire states carbon emissions
4993266 tasmanian forests are a massive contributor to the fight against climate change
4993267 responsible stewardship of land and sustainable management of our forest resources particularly reforestation and reduced deforestation has provided a sink reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4993268 under the kyoto protocol clear felling mature native forests to grow new trees doesnt count as land clearing so carbon emitted from that activity is left out of the ledger the result is that forestry gets a dream run in official emissions statistics
4993269 tasmanias state forests will absorb 31 million tonnes more atmospheric carbon than it will release making them a net sink of carbon over the next 43 years
4993270 given the undeniable urgency in confronting climate change for the forestry industry to continue to emit massive amounts of greenhouse gasses and deplete natures stores of carbon is a climate crime for tasmania to have to wait 22 years for positive carbon benefits from our forests is a major failure of our responsibility to future generations and a very poor example to set for the rest of the world
4993271 tropical forests move more carbon in and out of the atmosphere than any other ecosystem
4993272 there is preliminary evidence that wood smoke could be worse for peoples health than car exhaust pollution
4993273 forestry tasmania roll out the biomass plant idea every year when they are under public pressure about burning in the forests

4993294 nobody expected to be swept im not saying that we felt we were a world series team or anything but we didnt think our season would end three games into the playoffs that was the theme this spring weve got some unfinished business

4993297 i think a few times hes been rushing a little too quick from the stretch and not been able to get his arm up to where it belongs
4993298 he made a real good pitch on ramirez 3 2 that was called a ball
4993299 theres nothing wrong with him he feels good even when hes pitched well hes probably thrown as many balls from that lower slot its just that everybody looks at that when things arent going right
4993300 what weve been trying to do with jason knowing the fact that the last few years hes struggled in august and september were spacing him out a little more
4993301 i hope he appreciates it because thats what were trying to do to get him to finish nice and strong i think its having a positive effect as opposed to just pitching him every five days

4993446 i can and i will sod off its like having a dog chasing me twenty four seven with you around
4993447 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
4993448 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
4993449 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
4993450 its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts over my cold dead political carcass
4993451 the compact is the only protection colorado has from several more politically powerful downstream states
4993452 opening it for renegotiation would be the equivalent of a lamb discussing with a pack of wolves what should be on the dinner menu

4993454 the water is being pumped out as fast as we can get it pumped out
4993455 but unfortunately it looks as though the underpass will not be open tomorrow morning and we are currently doing contingency planning for that
4993456 we were on the ground from about four oclock in one area in lurgan which actually flooded last tuesday
4993457 we couldnt get sandbags we couldnt get anybody from water service rivers agency to take any action
4993458 getting from the north to the south of the site used to be slow and painstaking but the bridge will make it a delight
4993459 silent spring is a must read for anyone interested in the state of our planets health and was written almost 40 years ago
4993460 human beings are made up mostly of water in roughly the same percentage as water is to the surface of the earth we are 23 percent carbon 2 3 percent nitrogen 1 4 percent calcium 1 1 percent phosphorus with tiny amounts of roughly three dozen other elements but above all we are oxygen 61 percent and hydrogen 10 percent fused together in the unique molecular combination known as water which makes up 71 percent of the human body so when environmentalists assert that we are after all part of the earth it is no mere rhetorical flourish our blood even contains roughly the same percentage of salt as the ocean little wonder then that water carries such great spiritual significance in most religions from the water of the christian baptism to hinduisms sacred water of life we can not survive without fresh water which is only 2 5 percent of the total amount of water on earth most of that is locked away as ice and groundwater makes up most of what little remains or just 01 percent for all the lakes creeks streams rivers and rainfalls authors note recent studies indicate that because of pollution only 0001 of the planets water is available and consumable the problem is that both now and in the foreseeable future it is distributed unevenly throughout the world
4993461 if all of this is going on at such a big scale then there is nothing that i can do about it putting my plastic bottles in the recycling bin isnt going to fix the ocean heat pump
4993462 in sa the liberal party has been steadily decreasing female representation over the past decade at both a state and federal level
4993463 female mps continually show themselves to be some of the most hard working and effective members of the liberal team
4993464 it is not acceptable the female representation is as low as it is as a result of the partys continual reluctance to preselect women it is now far more difficult to engage women and has disenfranchised female members to the public the party not only looks out of touch but also more detrimentally it looks discriminative
4993465 attempting to avoid questions over water health and education crises by slashing the number of parliamentary sitting days
4993466 mike rann is presiding over a part time parliament which has just 16 days of sittings left this year that is unacceptable
4993467 the lower lakes are drying up and the river murray is dying yet the good news premier will not answer to parliament

4993473 je moet niet presteren altijd op jezelf betrekken als trainer
4993474 ik heb een aantal mensen tijdens het trainingskamp sneller zien zwemmen dan bij de wedstrijden in peking dan kan ik maar n conclusie trekken we hebben verkeerd gepiekt en daar ben ik verantwoordelijk voor
4993475 van pieter weet ik hoe hij reageert en hoe hij naar de wedstrijd toe nog beter kan worden inge is duidelijk niet in vorm verkeerd gepiekt marleen vind ik nog een twijfelgeval zij zwom vandaag op de 50 vrij goed alleen haar tijd was niet goed genoeg
4993476 met pieter ben ik al jaren gewend aan een bepaalde wedstrijdspecifieke voorbereiding die hem nog een stukje beter maakt tijdens het toernooi maar pieter is inge niet en pieter is marleen niet in plaats van dat het hen het laatste stukje voorwaarts bracht ging het een stukje achterwaarts na hongkong het is het verschil van een week misschien anderhalve week ik had beter moeten weten ik heb een inschattingsfout gemaakt en een verkeerde beslissing genomen
4993477 nee ik heb geen mentale problemen gezien of concentratieproblemen daar ligt het niet aan
4993478 ik vind dat wij nog steeds een goede groep hebben ik heb geen overspannen mensen gezien maar als het resultaat niet goed is moet ik als trainer naar de trainingen gaan kijken het randgebeuren was perfect het is echt niet zo dat het roer nu helemaal om moet dat is paniekvoetbal en daar is geen enkele reden toe het zit m in de details
4993479 dan is een vijfde plaats heel erg teleurstellend dan is er toch iets niet goed gegaan blijkbaar heb ik niet de absolute topvorm
4993480 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4993481 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4993482 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4993483 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4993484 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4993485 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4993486 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4993487 we know very well that the inguri hydropower plant supplies electricity to dozens of thousands of georgian and abkhaz homes and we are well aware that strategic facilities of this kind could be targeted in provocations and even terror attacks
4993488 arabs have it the worst in this country because we are invisible
4993489 what you really meant is that you were going to deal with the father yourself
4993490 you mean she saw them shooting bb guns right that must be why she didnt call the police

4993497 sub al ring con la instrucci n de atacar y atacar m s nada pero en los dos primeros asaltos mi rival no me dejaba tirar agarraba mucho en el tercer asalto logr tres golpes y en el cuarto asegur el combate con la defensa bien alta y movilidad en el ring

4993505 this is simply profit taking by greedy capitalists that inflicts suffering on the masses
4993506 criminal capitalists be warned dont keep trying to make a profit at the expense of the people if you drive us even more i will impose emergency measures and nationalize every business in america
4993507 this country is under illegal sanctions these are intended to achieve regime change we must strengthen our will and resistance so we can go through this time of difficulty all of our troubles are from outsiders my administration is working hard for the people of the united states and always will be you must tighten your belts
4993508 ensure that economic justice is served thats what this election is about
4993509 theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development
4993510 it will consider opening portions of the offshore outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4993511 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4993512 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4993513 the charge sheet will be presented in parliament by tuesday
4993514 whether he quits or counters the impeachment move will be decided after he sees the charges
4993515 the emissaries of musharraf are still in contact with the government and as far as we know musharrafs aides are advising him either to resign seeking an assurance for indemnity or try the supreme court
4993516 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
4993517 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
4993518 we should say that on the surface these employees were engaged in public services but in reality they were in the service of the international invaders they were serving the enemies of the afghans especially of afghan women
4993519 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political or military objectives
4993520 i am not sure how much longer i will play for it depends on whether i get a new contract
4993521 i am getting onto the level four coaching course this winter i am coming to the end of my career so we will just see what happens
4993522 i am not a big strong hitter of the ball so i have to find other ways of manipulating it
4993523 it is a big part of my game to rotate the strike and run as hard as i can so hitting a few boundary balls was a bonus
4993524 as i got in i thought that if i stayed until the end we would have a good chance of winning
4993525 barring the boys playing for england at the minute i cant think of a better young bowler
4993526 i know i am a kent man pumping up my own team mate but from what we saw out there i would challenge people to name a better young bowler who would have bowled better out there
4993527 robert joseph is rare because there are not many bowlers in domestic one day cricket who are a threat in the middle overs of the game
4993528 there are not many bowlers you could set two or three slips to in the 21st over
4993529 i know they didnt have a big score to chase but they were just surviving against him which is credit to him
4993530 he has extra pace hits the pitch hard he can swing it away a little bit and when he gets it right he bowls a good length
4993531 all the build up you turn up and bat like that
4993532 we were just brainless werent we the shots we played we just werent very smart to be honest
4993533 if target and urban outfitters mated their offspring would likely resemble targets red hot shop
4993534 his actions were spontaneous on witnessing what he believed to be enemy fire
4993535 larger than life character who lived his life to the full
4993536 he was a wonderful son to me and brother to thomas and scott and was looking forward to his future
4993537 although there was risk in mounting this offensive the decision was made after a careful judgment accepting that while risk can be minimised it can never be removed entirely
4993538 however good the indoctrination and the in theatre acclimatisation and all the things that are done already however good that is we will always continue to get these sort of incidents
4993539 undervalued the assets of the company and potentially would have adversely impacted the groups existing funding arrangements
4993540 ich habe von der ersten runde an gepusht aber seine erste runde war beeindruckend leider habe ich in der ersten kurve zeit hinter john hopkins verloren weil er mich berholt hat aber ich hatte danach eine gute pace und konnte auf casey aufholen
4993541 ich h tte casey einholen k nnen aber leider ist er gest rzt sonst w re es ein toller fight geworden
4993542 ohne den sturz w re es nicht so einfach gewesen
4993543 es ist perfekt wieder auf dem podium gewesen zu sein
4993544 wir verbessern uns mit jedem rennen in laguna seca habe ich einen fehler gemacht und ein podium verschenkt aber ich wusste dass es hier m glich sein w rde
4993545 ich konnte meine gesundheit in der pause auskurieren und das podium ist sehr wichtig f r mich und das team ab morgen testen wir das neue bike dann beginnt f r uns die neue saison
4993546 its a wonderful day for jamaica it was a stunning performance and were so proud of you
4993547 the games are not yet over and we expect a lot more from the team in the days ahead but i can assure you that we are planning a massive welcome home party for all of you
4993548 we have chances in the mens 200m womens 200m the womens 100m hurdles the mens 400m hurdles the womens 400m and all four relays
4993549 so we have a lot of expectations that there are more medals to be won
4993550 i knew he had it in him i cant wait for him to break the 200m record and then run 42 seconds in the 400m
4993551 he has taken jamaica on his back and demolished the whole world that is the respect to be given to the greatest sprinter of all time
4993552 it was euphoria it was the greatest feeling ive had in all my life because jamaica has never had the joy and glory of a gold medal in the 100m sprint in my 60 years
4993553 and in addition to getting our first gold he broke the world record it is an experience that is almost unspeakable it brought me out in goose bumps
4993554 that wasnt just my feeling but the whole of jamaica i got reports from the districts and cities back home where people were out on the streets hailing the victory
4993555 it was good old vintage reggae it was tremendous of the organisers they were able to find a piece of music that helped us celebrate
4993556 we are expecting at least another five medals from the track and we feel very confident if we do that then i would not be surprised if we declared a national holiday
4993557 its ridiculous to say he was disrespectful in the way he finished
4993558 hes a young athlete hes having a great time and this sport of all sports needs that hes carefree hes got the talent he did not do it in a disrespectful way he is just excited about his sport
4993559 when bolt broke the world record at the national championships and at all the championships in which he has participated in between he and the other jamaican sprinters have been tested
4993560 i live and socialise in london and since being crowned miss great britain ive been linked to people like footballers
4993561 people may have a perception of me that i only go for certain types of men but nothing could be further from the truth
4993562 some of the men who approach me in london clubs can be cocky and full of attitude but id prefer a normal guy with a normal job
4993563 if he worked as a binman and he made me laugh who knows having a good sense of humour is top of my list someone who doesnt take life too seriously
4993564 the last time i was snapped kissing a beautiful woman was on my wedding day
4993565 i have a love hate thing going on with rex
4993566 i think the producers were scared of him walking out and as he is one of the more dominant housemates i think they put his girlfriend nicole in the house to stop him walking
4993567 sometimes id love to hit him he is an arrogant so and so but there is definitely something sexy about him
4993568 i got a phone call from the production team to say that they are putting together special programmes and events for its 50th birthday
4993569 ive got a few wee jobs in october but i will do my utmost to definitely be there because blue peter has been a massive part of my life
4993570 we started filming last friday and will be working solidly on it for the next few weeks but they very kindly released me to come home and judge the high school musical competition
4993571 im due back at work on bratz at 8am on sunday i havent actually had a day off since i left blue peter my first day off is on september 7
4993572 i was in dublin last week to do a job with disney so i arranged for my best friend and my sister to come down for a girly night out and go for something to eat
4993573 my best friend nichola said to me do you know that i havent seen you for four months that made me realise how the time has flown in since i left blue peter it would be really nice if i got some downtime soon it would be lovely to come back to bangor and go and sit on ballyholme beach
4993574 well there is no ring on my finger whether that means im single or not i couldnt comment
4993575 its a dream come true for me to do a game show like hot rods and now to be doing a massive big tv fashion project
4993576 i know that i am really fortunate it is great that i have already ticked two boxes two things that i really wanted to do
4993577 well any presenter nowadays wants to do a big saturday night show
4993578 i love working in childrens tv and i would not turn my back on it but i would like to do tv for an adult audience
4993579 i hate that saying about things being in the pipeline but there are are some things well see what happens
4993580 baird showed his face in ballymoney once or twice but he has been in the ballymena area for months now working as a joiner
4993581 but since sunday life exposed his violent past the people he works with just dont want anything to do with him any more and are giving him the cold shoulder treatment
4993582 and hes already been put on the streets by his best pal after he discovered baird was having an affair with his girlfriend
4993583 he had been living with him at his home near cullybacky but when the pal found out about the fling he threw baird out
4993584 i have said everything i have to say to the people that matter the parole commissioners
4993585 im really sorry for what ive done and im just trying to get on with my life
4993586 i hadnt really any reason but i was tired my relationship with alison was not getting on i had a few drinks taken and phillip was crying
4993587 i hit him in the stomach with the knuckle bent back
4993588 i grabbed him by the arm and kicked him i let him go and he stumbled back a few steps
4993589 i kicked him again in the stomach and he fell on the stairs
4993590 hes worked for us for a good while and ive got nothing but good to say for him he gets on with his days work hes trying to re establish his life and get on with it
4993591 three different sources rang me to ask if i would consider this guy it came from the church from within the prison and a third source
4993592 i would be quite careful like all employers i took all the information i could get i brought him in and worked him through a system where i could monitor him quite closely with people who knew his background and were willing to work with him
4993593 if he stepped out of line in any way even to use bad language i rung them authorities and they just put him straight back inside
4993594 hes in a very very strict regime i have been given very precise guidance on it risk management i was very well briefed
4993595 they said to me they would not be letting him out unless they had confidence in him
4993596 i am coming from a christian point of view you give a guy a second chance
4993597 the guys he is working with i have made them away of where he is coming from and some of them have commented to me and a couple of guys have objected to working with him
4993598 i said to them that i respect their wish and they will not be on the same sites
4993599 if theres a big splash in the paper i am probably going to have to dismiss him image is so important today and i cant afford negative image
4993600 this whole thing is just hard to take in and i cant believe we have lost our beautiful daughter i dont think we will ever get over this terrible tragedy
4993601 when we were in the hospital and jennifer was in a coma i was just hoping and praying that she would pull through but i knew the situation wasnt good
4993602 she was my blue eyed girl and i dont know how im going to live without her every time i think of her lying in that hospital bed it just breaks my heart
4993603 if there are still young people out there who drive recklessly then i would beg them to stop because they have no idea what devastation they could cause
4993604 if they could step into our world for a brief moment then they would realise the horrors of what can emerge from a car accident
4993605 you never think that something like this will come to your door and nothing can prepare you for it i just hope that jennifer is the last young person in this society who loses their life in such a tragic accident
4993606 i still want to know what happened that night but that can come at a later time we are just grieving for a beautiful human being at the moment
4993607 we also recognise that the young lad driving the car is in a terrible state and he will have to live with what happened for the rest of his life
4993608 his parents are also deeply upset by what happened and we know their lives will never be the same again its just such a terrible tragedy for everyone and an experience that i wouldnt like to see anyone endure
4993609 the number of people who turned out to pay tribute to jennifer was incredible
4993610 we have had tremendous support from friends and from relatives in belfast and dublin they have all in their own way helped us through a very difficult time
4993611 i would also like to thank the emergency services staff at the royal and our police family liaison officer for doing everything they could to help us
4993612 jennifer was just so full of life and just lived for the weekend
4993613 she was such a popular girl and was just looking forward to starting her career as a nurse we cant believe this has happened and we all just miss her so much
4993614 this is a very difficult time for our family and we will never forget the happy memories we had with jennifer we have had a lot of support and we cant thank people enough
4993615 i cannot begin to understand the pain and suffering that tommy and oonagh and their family are experiencing at this time but i continue to remember them in my thoughts and prayers
4993616 they have lost their cherished daughter and little can be done to ease their pain
4993617 the rowden familys lives will never be the same again
4993618 other young people sustained injuries that they will carry for a long time and the young driver has received a life sentence of sorts with what he will have to carry into his future as a result of this accident
4993619 i would urge all young drivers to think clearly will your actions affect you or others and is the risk worth it
4993620 seeing voices from the language of non signers and hearers this issue is very politically charged and oliver sacks book on the topic

4993743 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4993744 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4993745 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n

4993754 our children will have to compete for jobs not only with each other but with the kids from other countries as well

4993756 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4993757 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4993758 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4993759 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4993760 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4993761 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4993762 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4993763 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4993764 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4993765 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4993766 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4993767 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4993768 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4993769 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4993770 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4993771 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4993772 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4993773 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

4993800 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4993801 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4993802 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

4993835 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
4993836 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4993837 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4993838 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
4993839 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4993840 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4993841 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4993842 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4993843 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4993844 it cant be described well never ever see it again
4993845 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
4993846 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4993847 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
4993848 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
4993849 having added strength up front is a situation i really enjoy
4993850 we have reached agreement with fulham and we still have one or two things to settle with the player and his representatives but we are hopeful that one will go through
4993851 tipper phelps er mer glad i jason lezak enn mark spitz er
4993852 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4993853 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4993854 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4993855 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4993856 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4993857 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4993858 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4993859 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4993860 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4993861 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4993862 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4993863 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4993864 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4993865 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4993866 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4993867 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4993868 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4993869 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4993870 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4993871 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4993872 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4993873 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4993874 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4993875 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4993876 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4993877 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4993878 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4993879 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4993880 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4993881 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4993882 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4993883 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4993884 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4993885 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4993886 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4993887 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4993888 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4993889 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4993890 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4993891 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4993892 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4993893 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4993894 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4993895 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4993896 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4993897 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4993898 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4993899 we have taken the decision to withdraw the support from the state government
4993900 the central government has been a mute spectator it is following a wrong policy of division
4993901 we have many options to continue our protests but we would better not disclose them
4993902 it could be but right now there is no blockade if we really do the whole world will come to know
4993903 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4993904 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4993905 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4993906 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4993907 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4993908 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4993909 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4993910 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4993911 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4993912 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4993913 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4993914 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4993915 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4993916 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4993917 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4993918 the licensor dot shall have the right to direct the licensee telecom company to warn penalise or terminate the franchisee or agent or distributor or servant after considering any report of conduct or antecedents detrimental to the security of the nation
4993919 the decision of the licensor dot in this regard shall be final and binding
4993920 i dont know why i went ahead with it i didnt love shafiq and i didnt really want him i was just stupid and naive
4993921 shafiq was in scotland on a six month visa but had over stayed for three years last june he was stopped for driving without a license following which the authorities discovered that he was staying illegally
4993922 i first met him at his uncles house in glasgow and we were together for a few weeks but he was seeing someone else and we broke up before he was taken to dungavel he phoned me from there last july and proposed i was drunk and agreed to go to pakistan and marry him his uncle farooq arranged everything
4993923 he shop owner farooq gave me 100 pounds to show my mum that i had been earning while i was supposed to have been in glasgow
4993924 some outfits have called for sonawar uno chalo we have met leaders of these outfits and expressed fears that the assembly may turn violent
4993925 we requested them to review their decision to mobilise masses in the city tomorrow
4993926 whenever there is a huge mobilisation of masses the mobs turn unruly and indulge in violence
4993927 we have seen this at pampore yesterday a house was damaged by a mob despite calls for non violence the leaders are not able to control the masses
4993928 the release decision to release showed palestinians that dialogue not violence achieved the best results
4993929 prendi oggi e cominci a pagare in comode rate fra sei mesi
4993930 an offshore yuan market in keeping with the process of the currencys internationalisation
4993931 and setting up such a market will be the first step toward that end
4993932 its financial infrastructure is stronger too offering a better base for the market
4993933 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4993934 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4993935 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
4993936 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4993937 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4993938 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
4993939 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
4993940 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
4993941 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
4993942 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
4993943 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
4993944 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me
4993945 decker was calling me a chicken s mother f get out and i will beat your ass

4993953 nothing is impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4993954 i literally wanted to do something that no ones ever done before in this sport without the help of my teammates it wouldnt have been possible
4993955 i did not feel my finger shaking but i guess it was
4993956 i have raced a lot before i know a lot about running
4993957 i think i performed quite well today although i couldnt catch ndereba i tried my best and im really satisfied with the result
4993958 i just want to enjoy this moment because im having an unbelievable year
4993959 its more than my best dreams so i want to enjoy the moment i know how difficult it is to win these things especially here winning for me is unbelievable
4993960 its very difficult to explain the way i feel right now it will take a few days before i realize im olympic champion
4993961 but this is for sure the biggest moment in my career in my life i will never forget this moment
4993962 its a great goal i did it in athens and now i did it here
4993963 pensabamos que tendria que salir sin pantalones nada mas pero al parecer no es asi
4993964 if theres anything unsettling to the stomach its watching actors on television talk about their personal lives
4993965 we are updating our database please update us on your hobbies and musical inclination
4993966 types of hobbies eca you have engaged are engaging in during your leisure time musical inclination member of any committees clubs etc and if you are holding positions
4993967 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
4993968 arguing on the internet is like running in the special olympics even if you win youre still retarded
4993969 we are extremely proud to announce the launch of the airtel callhome service in the uk the uk has one of the largest nri populations in the world
4993970 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
4993971 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
4993972 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4993973 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4993974 they ignored our earlier warnings to shift from the site when the water level had touched the danger mark now we have evacuated them to safer places
4993975 this is for the first time in the last five six years that water level in yamuna has reached to 205 55 meters however there is no imminent threat to life and property
4993976 the water level in the yamuna has risen consistently as haryana is releasing 2 5000 cusecs of rainwater everyday and if this continues the water level is expected to further rise in the next few days
4993977 i understand that the taxpayer wants to know but it isnt clear yet all costs are being strictly recorded
4993978 the city anticipates to use 120 men and contract workers will add 75 workers
4993979 they have pulled personnel from a lot of other sites
4993980 unsure how long it would be able to remain on site without being able to contact officials at sunrise
4993981 i completely understand the city cant wait to act on this
4993982 this is just a huge step in the wrong direction
4993983 im a christian we dont like porn i dont feel it should be broadcasted
4993984 to be honest i cant have a real opinion on it because i havent even seen it
4993985 i dont know if its going to negatively affect us but if more people hear about it our back entrance might not be used as much
4993986 being in my 20s its not the end of the world for me but its definitely an odd situation
4993987 we know there are going to be naysayers but we know this is a business
4993988 we had some rough waves which made it pretty difficult and some cold water of course but im here now
4993989 the fact that he is not shaking like a leaf right now is a good sign
4993990 his pacers were actually becoming slightly hypothermic and we were worried about him
4993991 one of those guys thats very quiet and you know when he puts his mind to something hes going to do it
4993992 over the past few years ive had an uncomfortable sense that someone or something has been tinkering with my brain remapping the neural circuitry reprogramming the memory
4993993 my mind isnt going so far as i can tell but its changing
4993994 immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy my mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument and id spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose
4993995 thats rarely the case anymore now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages i get fidgety lose the thread begin looking for something else to do i feel as if im always dragging my wayward brain back to the text the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle
4993996 my mind now expects to take in information the way the net distributes it in a swiftly moving stream of particles
4993997 once i was a scuba diver in the sea of words now i zip along the surface like a guy on a jet ski
4993998 it is clear that users are not reading online in the traditional sense indeed there are signs that new forms of reading are emerging as users power browse horizontally through titles contents pages and abstracts going for quick wins
4993999 it almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense
4994000 use the wizard to set up a typical policy for a common scenario
4994001 hey lets paint the wall by the table royal purple
4994002 semua itu menunjukkan kaderisasi parpol sangat buruk jika tidak mereka kan tidak mau main comot kiri kanan orang luar saya bukan anti artis namun bukan kah profesi mereka selama ini selalu memerankan orang selain dirinya apa bisa mereka nanti memperjuangkan nasib konkret rakyat
4994003 orang orang yang asal dicomot itu selain tidak berkeringat tentunya sangat meragukan dan belum tentu bisa diharapkan mampu memperjuangkan nasib rakyat mereka akan tetap dimajukan kecuali memang kenyataannya para politisi sekarang pikirannya sudah sedemikian dangkal
4994004 people are confused and lethargic not simply because they are tired of hearing the gospel or because they have never really been emotionally gripped by it but also because they are confused they have not heard the gospel in a way that provokes a thoughtful basement to attic reappraisal of themselves and their world
4994005 unknown to our medical authorities although its diagnostic symptom the absconding from service is well known to our planters and overseers
4994006 made themselves too familiar with slaves treating them as equals
4994007 proper medical advice strictly followed this troublesome practice that many negroes have of running away can be almost entirely prevented
4994008 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
4994009 we are therefore unalterably opposed to entangling alliances via treaties or any other form of commitment which compromise our national sovereignty or commit us to intervention in foreign wars we are opposed to the negotiation or ratification of any treaty agreement or partnership that would deprive united states citizens of their rights protected by the united states constitution
4994010 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accomplish our overthrow our destruction should it come at all will be from another quarter from the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government from their carelessness and negligence i must confess that i do apprehend some danger i fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men and become the instruments of their own undoing
4994011 would you want to know if the most horrific attack on your country was perpatrated by its own government would you really want to know
4994012 made by the wachowski brothers and joel silver of matrix fame
4994013 we can be sure that the wachowski brothers were referencing the order out of chaos system since at one point in the film the opressive english parliment gets frustrated that their society is embracing the terrorist acts against them and decides to begin committing terrorist acts under the guise of v in order to turn the people against him and again embrace their oppressive form of government police state they even unleash a biological virus on their people in the film killing almost 100 000 people and if the history of terrorism in literature and cinema is any indicator you should probably mind your hygeine habits in the coming years because as exhibited below several times in recent years terrorist acts have been depicted almost exactly as they go down in entertainment sold to us beforehand
4994014 as for anyone who scoffs at the notion that government connected interests could be planting depictions of terrorism in hollywood that isnt the allegation the more realistic notion is that such interests have been made privy to certain plotlines and then decide to preempt them in real life to affect how you see their portrayal upon release of the entertainment material
4994015 but perhaps that is the desired goal by the powers that be to push americans until they fight back and really give you a pretext to lay on the police state thick since the outcome of another staged attack like 9 11 really cannot be gauged considering the growth in the population who are not so sure 9 11 is what they thought it was anymore if an attack were to occur tomorrow i dont believe theyre certain they can sell us on their version of it and i believe that scares them
4994016 as a community we would expect those to be followed through
4994017 its an issue you can speak to that will get the attention of tens of thousands of families
4994018 we intend to keep this issue front and center through november
4994019 i would be surprised if thats the last we see of them

4994037 hed done everything but score up to today hes that little bit extra special hes brought something we hadnt possessed in the squad
4994038 he can create a goal at nothing if youve got that youve always got the edge hes almost like a cult hero already as he was at southend and wolves theres plenty more to come from him
4994039 in the first half there was only one team in it and coventry scored against the run of play
4994040 we managed to get back in the game but one long ball and a bit of magic from freddy eastwood has undone us so i am disappointed to lose the game but there are a lot of positives for us i think we are a good side we just need to start putting chances away
4994041 it should have been a spot kick there was no nudge from darren
4994042 i work in ideal conditions in a beautiful environment with a new manager who has some really interesting technical methods
4994043 there was a lot of misinformation in the press about me so much that the manager came to me several times to ask whether i wanted to stay or leave
4994044 every time i responded that i would be remaining and he scolari has always showed a great deal of interest in me
4994045 for me the case is closed i am staying at chelsea

4994050 it is hot but we see a lot of major leaguers come through here
4994051 it still comes down to baseball and throwing strikes getting timely hits both teams are uncomfortable playing in the heat for sure but you still need to play the game both sides have to deal with it

4994080 i had neck surgery in january ive been out of the game for a while its been kind of a difficult thing getting everything fine tuned i didnt want to do the whole extreme weight cutting thing just quite yet ill do that for my next fight
4994081 im 100 percent prepared or repaired i spent three or four months not able to do anything im slowly getting back into it ive got 100 percent recovery as far as my doctors concerned and as far as im concerned im training like two and three times a day
4994082 apparently hes a tough guy hes going to look better than me guaranteed he used to be an amateur body builder im suspecting physically hell look better than me i guess hes a wrestler from american kickboxing academy but beyond that i dont know too much about him to be honest
4994083 when i was initially contacted about it i immediately jumped in
4994084 because regardless of how im portrayed on tv when it comes to doing something especially for kids im all for it
4994085 i think well have a good team this year i really do
4994086 could be a forerunner for a new eclipse coupe which could go on sale in europe
4994087 i knew i was out there for the right reasons obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
4994088 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i step on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
4994089 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
4994090 he did a nice job for being around for a short period of time it shows what type of veteran he is he just drove down and scored it just shows his expertise at the quarterback position
4994091 i wasnt that nervous i thought it was more butterflies
4994092 considering it was a preseason game and i had a little built up anxiety i wanted to get this game over with i wanted to play in it but i wanted to get it over with and just go on
4994093 you would think the deeper pass obviously to jerricho my arm feels great ive been throwing the ball well once i get the timing down with these guys ill be ok
4994094 favre came to me later in the game and said i was going to let you have the ball but i think i am going to keep that one
4994095 i said ok thats cool i will keep the next one then as soon as we get into the locker room i got a ball that says congrats dustin on your first touchdown and he signed it for me its really cool its something that i can keep forever
4994096 it was a little weird for the most part i felt comfortable in this uniform i feel comfortable in this locker room
4994097 i had numerous people on the redskins team say it almost dont look right its got to start looking right im having a good time and i know were gauged on wins and losses
4994098 its just my first preseason game but im pleased the way it worked out we still have a long way to go it was a little awkward i knew they had to get that out of the way in order to get where we wanted to be
4994099 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
4994100 of course its a bit of a pity that im leaving hamburg and the club but i think its a good decision for me i need to play and to continue to develop

4994114 there is a lot of pressure for us because this is the one that means everything
4994115 we have had more success than we could have ever wished for but that wont mean anything if we dont come home with gold
4994116 the pressure is going to be there every game we play at these olympics and we have to respond to it in the right way we need to use it to help us kick some butt and not to make us nervous and affect us negatively
4994117 in some ways i feel incredibly lucky that i get to turn 30 at such a special event like the olympic games
4994118 it is amazing for me to have so many friends and family here to support me and to share my birthday with me but as an athlete you have to make sure that your performance comes first so i cant let the fun get out of control
4994119 it is actually nice to be able to switch off for a bit and concentrate on enjoying kerris birthday
4994120 we will make sure we are totally focused when the time comes to compete
4994121 i truly feel that because of our line of work we are blessed we can be together and take the kids on the road with us
4994122 starting a family is something we are definitely thinking about
4994123 i shot a great match its just a crazy thing that happens
4994124 just worrying about calming myself down and just breaking a good shot and so i didnt even look at the number
4994125 the way i come into a target is i start above the target and come down from 12 oclock and get into the
4994126 and as i get down into the is when i start to get on the trigger
4994127 as i was starting to get on the trigger the gun just went off
4994128 i was like uh thats not going to be good
4994129 hes definitely the best standing shooter out there if he can still end up fourth with a 4 4 on the last shot thats a hell of a shooter
4994130 hearing the spectators cheering i felt maybe i got the silver but my coach told me i got the gold
4994131 the runners saturday were definitely getting up to five miles some of them can already do the five miles and do more but you know they need to be up to six and for us walkers were pretty much almost to the three already
4994132 i just want to see people working out they dont have to be with me necessarily to do it and what i am seeing is people are working out
4994133 ill see somebody that i havent seen in a few weeks and theyre now running four miles whereas at the beginning of this program they werent even doing a mile so i know theyre doing it on their own now and most people are up to five days a week running now
4994134 media liars go into overdrive as rwb 2008 becomes best yet
4994135 i finished second four times and i really learned a lot each time i dont feel surprised because i keep learning and working hard and being relaxed
4994136 i have to play my own game and not think too much i have a four shot lead so theres a lot of room to play good
4994137 of course you dont expect anything like that that probably made my day
4994138 im making a lot more putts than i did the first day
4994139 all i can do is play the best i can and try to shoot a low score ill focus on being consistent hitting fairways and greens
4994140 i actually hit a lot of good shots i just never converted obviously im very disappointed
4994141 it was such a long day and i had a headache so i just tried to concentrate on every shot
4994142 i didnt hit the ball good and i didnt putt good i made birdie on the last hole and have a little chance now theres nothing i can do just come here tomorrow and do my best
4994143 im out of contention to win now but i still feel i can shoot in the 60s out here and that would be a great way to finish to get back into red numbers

4994154 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
4994155 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
4994156 it was as though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
4994157 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england

4994197 quiero expresar mi profunda molestia en relaci n con los piropos en chile con lo que estoy segura que representar a una enorme cantidad de mujeres tanto chilenas como extranjeras
4994198 cuando una mujer camina por la calle es rid culo no hay libertad no estoy acostumbrada a que me griten y los piropos en grupo me asustan un poco
4994199 qu derecho tiene un hombre a gritarle a una mujer desconocida cuando va por la calle es una prepotencia en suecia los piropos no existen son penados por la ley incluso ante una mirada insinuante la mujer tiene derecho de denunciarla a la polic a
4994200 cuando llegu ac le coment a mi marido que por fin pod a andar por la calle y ser una mujer respetada pero cada vez que vuelvo a chile siento lo mismo que esta chica un desagrado
4994201 me gustan los piropos que son sinceros y elegantes tambi n me gusta cuando uno pasa por una construcci n y te cantan entre todos la canci n mijita rica mijita rica lalalalalalalalalala
4994202 los piropos de mi pa s son s per expl citos en cuanto a contenido sexual y pueden ser medio agresivos en cambio los chilenos son m s respetuosos y tienen un estilo mucho m s galante
4994203 cuando son groseros les contesto pero si es algo simp tico y son amables les sonr o y a veces les doy las gracias
4994204 muchas mujeres agradecen despu s de los piropos pero la clave es no pasarse de la raya
4994205 es probable que ella no los entienda bien y cuando el maestro aplica la astucia en ingl s es peor porque como la mayor a sabe decir puras groser as le gritan eso entonces seguro se intimida
4994206 los piropos deben ser juzgados y evaluados en el marco de la cultura en que operan porque de otro modo resultan incomprensibles
4994207 forman parte de culturas m s latinas que exhiben niveles de modernidad inferiores a las anglosajonas donde las relaciones entre las personas son evaluadas con otros par metros de mayor igualdad

4994213 i then saw smoke rising from the ground up to the sky and only then did i hear the explosion the plane then turned around
4994214 it has become common practice for the russian air force and for the government troops to sneak into the georgian territory
4994215 but what is different in this incident is that they have threatened georgian airspace much deeper and that they have used a very powerful bomb
4994216 russias air force neither on monday nor tuesday flew flights over georgia
4994217 while no one can say for sure whether it was a fuel tank or a rocket or a bomb which fell i fail to see why a russian plane would bomb territory close to south ossetia
4994218 therefore i urge you brothers in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship
4994219 be devoted to one another in brotherly love honor one another above yourselves
4994220 let the word of christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom and as you sing psalms hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to god
4994221 a christian needs his brother as a bearer and proclaimer of the divine word of salvation the christ in his own heart is weaker than the christ in the word of his brother his own heart is uncertain his brothers is sure

4994256 i really didnt even start wrestling like myself until the last two matches

4994263 there is information that half a dozen blackwater guards who have been accused of shooting and killing 17 iraqis are to be tried in washington
4994264 the iraqi government stresses its rights and that blackwater guards have committed crimes against iraqi victims
4994265 a great white elephant has just eetered the home base business arena
4994266 what if it worked for you how would that change your life
4994267 so we had to develop a new type of senor to measure re entry conditions for spacecraft
4994268 one application where the sensor is particularly useful is measurement of the human breath with this sensor we can measure oxygen carbon dioxide and obtain the results immediately something which is impossible with conventional systems
4994269 this system can reduce the exhaust gases that are harmful for the environment and at the same time by ensuring the heating system works at an optimum level it can also reduse fuel consumption by about 10 to 15 spotting hydrogen leakage another terrestrial application for the miniature sensor is the development of handy easy to use portable system to test for hydrocarbon leakage in industrial installations such as the ones used for manufacturing fuel cells
4994270 a ideia que eu tenho esta se os partidos pol ticos continuarem neste rame rame nesta monotonia nesta falta de imagina o nesta demiss o que o que se passa com os partidos pol ticos excep o do partido comunista e o ps se for entronizando como uma esp cie de uni o nacional do regime h que fazer um novo partido
4994271 um partido ao centro com base nos grandes princ pios de justi a distributiva da doutrina social da igreja cat lica e que simultaneamente descentraliza o poder para que os recursos n o fiquem todos em lisboa
4994272 poss vel fazer se este partido caso estes partidos actuais n o recuperem e sejam cada vez mais partidos da situa o
4994273 um partido da oposi o a s rio porque em todos os concelhos do pa s h quadros pol ticos que n o se rev em na actual situa o pol tica nacional nem nos actuais partidos
4994274 poss vel arrancar com um partido que seja uma gironda contra os jacobinos de lisboa
4994275 partido que resulta de uma grande jun o de todos aqueles que tem ideias regionalistas em todo o pais e est o fartos do jacobinismo
4994276 como ser a evolu o da pol tica dos pr ximos tempos
4994277 mas se o quadro for este e quando chegarmos a outubro vermos que o ps uma esp cie de uni o nacional do regime e que os outros partidos n o contam ent o preciso fazer uma coisa nova para mudar portugal
4994278 these are dirty tactics it is a malicious campaign on their part and is completely immoral
4994279 i am telling you there is no case they cannot proceed the medical report is so clear in the event the judicial system is fair whichever judge hears the case will throw it out
4994280 you can see the dirty tricks beginning in their campaign it is corrupt and immoral to use religion and the koran
4994281 dont insult the religion of islam by playing political games
4994282 they will probably try to convince voters that islam is under threat and that malay rights are under threat
4994283 it is not called the mother of by elections for nothing it is an indication of national politics and of our track record so far it is a barometer of politics in malaysia at large
4994284 if anwar succeeds in pulling in a large number of malay votes it will boost the oppositions standing and the road to forming the next government will be clearer
4994285 thats what most people are buying right now this year
4994286 i mean this is the time of back to school and thats what they need to save money on
4994287 a los 20 minutos se escuch una fuerte explosi n cerca a la zona de licores
4994288 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
4994289 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4994290 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4994291 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
4994292 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4994293 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4994294 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4994295 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4994296 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4994297 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4994298 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4994299 i was told it was multiple sclerosis i was told it was a brain tumor i was told it was just stress that i was freaking out that it was nothing

4994303 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
4994304 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
4994305 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
4994306 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
4994307 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
4994308 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games

4994327 he played football and ran at school until he was forced to make a decision in 2003
4994328 we were only praying for richard to get a good start in the race

4994494 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4994495 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4994496 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4994497 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4994498 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4994499 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4994500 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4994501 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4994502 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4994503 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4994504 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4994505 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4994506 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4994507 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4994508 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4994509 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4994510 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4994511 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4994512 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4994513 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4994514 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4994515 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4994516 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4994517 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4994518 who are open to doing something on the production side
4994519 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4994520 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4994521 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4994522 somos una r a totalmente renovada limpia y una r a que va en el plazo de un a o o a o y medio a verter todo en la depuradora
4994523 renfe arregl unas tuber as que pasaban por debajo de la v a del tren y ahora queremos desmontar el viejo tuvo del aliviadero del hospital

4994527 luego que digan que no contaminan lo que pasa es que a coru a no quiere mojarse
4994528 el problema surge cuando se habla de responsabilidad de las viviendas quien ha conectado el colector de fecales a la r a es responsable pero tambi n lo es el ayuntamiento porque tiene una determinada responsabilidad en el control de ese vertido lo que hay que concretar es desde cu ndo los hab a si el gobierno local hizo algo o no
4994529 itll never come to that youll always have friends and family
4994530 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4994531 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4994532 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4994533 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4994534 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4994535 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4994536 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4994537 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4994538 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4994539 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4994540 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4994541 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4994542 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4994543 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4994544 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4994545 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4994546 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4994547 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4994548 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4994549 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4994550 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4994551 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4994552 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4994553 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4994554 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4994555 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4994556 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4994557 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4994558 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4994559 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4994560 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4994561 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4994562 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4994563 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4994564 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4994565 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4994566 strip malls and low rise office parks dominate the landscape of northern san jose but a long term redevelopment plan could make over large swaths of the area along decidedly more urban lines

4994572 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4994573 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4994574 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4994575 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4994576 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4994577 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4994578 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4994579 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4994580 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4994581 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4994582 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4994583 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4994584 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4994585 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4994586 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4994587 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4994588 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4994589 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4994590 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4994591 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4994592 ha tomado el debate sobre la modificaci n de la financiaci n auton mica como un nuevo campo de batalla con el presidente jos luis rodr guez zapatero y su gobierno
4994593 culpa a zapatero de la actual financiaci n auton mica y de sus consecuencias en las cuentas de la generalitat al tener que asumir servicios para un mill n m s de personas sin que se produzca una transferencia adicional
4994594 que no contemplaba los ajuste de poblaci n fue elaborado y aprobado con el pp en la generalitat y en el gobierno de espa a
4994595 con el pp se bloquearon las transferencias extraordinarias y las inversiones
4994596 ha hecho de la comunitat valenciana la m s endeudada sin que eso haya repercutido en un aumento proporcional de servicios y derechos p blicos
4994597 la deuda no viene del mill n de habitantes m s sino de la mala gesti n y el despilfarro
4994598 camps es un desleal y que falta a la verdad con el nico inter s de tapar el aislamiento que sufr a la comunitat con mariano rajoy de ministro
4994599 ahora con zapatero han aumentado un 92 por ciento las inversiones y son obras tangibles las del ave el aeropuerto los paseos mar timos el programa agua
4994600 otros ejemplos son las transferencias para servicios p blicos como la sanidad que han pasado de nueve millones de euros en ocho a os a 1170 millones de euros en cuatro a os a los que hay que a adir una nueva transferencia reciente de m s de 47 millones de euros
4994601 igual pasa con la gratuidad de libros de texto que reciben m s de seis millones de euros anuales o las ayudas para hacer gratuita la educaci n de cero a tres a os
4994602 es necesario e imprescindible un gran pacto valenciano para superar la situaci n actual
4994603 es m s grave que la del conjunto del pa s
4994604 ha hecho una propuesta que se hace imprescindible si queremos salir antes y reforzados de la actual situaci n econ mica

4994610 do you know what ive actually had in a way a really fantastic year
4994611 its probably one of the best years ive ever had ironically
4994612 we did the sell out tour which was an unbelievable experience we played the o2 you cant describe that feeling
4994613 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
4994614 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
4994615 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
4994616 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
4994617 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
4994618 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush

4994625 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4994626 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4994627 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
4994628 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
4994629 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
4994630 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
4994631 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it

4994636 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county
4994637 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4994638 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4994639 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4994640 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4994641 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4994642 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4994643 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4994644 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons

4994646 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4994647 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4994648 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4994649 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4994650 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4994651 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4994652 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4994653 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives

4994656 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter

4994667 were going beyond facebook to get this issue in the face of adults and other teens together we can solve it
4994668 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4994669 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4994670 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both

4994700 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4994701 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4994702 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4994703 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4994704 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4994705 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4994706 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4994707 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference

4994709 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four

4994712 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4994713 just so you all know we did set a record
4994714 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4994715 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4994716 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4994717 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4994718 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4994719 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4994720 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4994721 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4994722 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4994723 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4994724 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4994725 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4994726 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4994727 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4994728 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4994729 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4994730 it was a pleasing start to get a game under our belts and to give everybody some game time
4994731 everybody enjoyed getting a game wed trained hard this week and to back that up at the end of the week is encouraging
4994732 for our pre season we know weve got to test ourselves and its pointless playing easy games france is one of the hardest places to come especially playing one of their top teams with a french referee
4994733 the players found that and even though some of them only played a half they came off knowing theyd been in a game it was very quick and the contact area was very physical i think we adapted quite well we learned some lessons from what happened during the game
4994734 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4994735 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4994736 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4994737 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4994738 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4994739 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4994740 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4994741 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4994742 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4994743 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4994744 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4994745 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4994746 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4994747 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4994748 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4994749 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4994750 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4994751 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4994752 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4994753 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4994754 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4994755 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4994756 automakers made some big changes to their production plans based on preferences in the second quarter
4994757 but if gas prices continue to recede to the long term trend line automakers may find that they overreacted to a temporary shift in consumers preferences
4994758 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4994759 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4994760 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4994761 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4994762 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4994763 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4994764 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4994765 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4994766 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4994767 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4994768 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4994769 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4994770 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4994771 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4994772 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4994773 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4994774 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4994775 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4994776 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4994777 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4994778 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4994779 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4994780 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4994781 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4994782 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4994783 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4994784 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4994785 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4994786 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4994787 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4994788 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4994789 there is the group that dislikes the hummer and the group that dislikes the prius
4994790 and its for almost the same reason the marketing of lifestyles that are almost nonexistent
4994791 all i can say is if anybody knows me they wont think that
4994792 probably the hummer assuming that we dont ever go back to 10 a barrel gas
4994793 itll be just like the ridiculous big fins of the 1950s that people kind of laugh at now
4994794 i used to get the comments like you stupid tree hugger
4994795 you look at the amount of gas she uses to get our family from one place to another compared to what i use and its ridiculous
4994796 im 75 years old and i didnt get my first car until i was 55
4994797 as far as im concerned i have about 30 years of gas coming to me i never had a chance to use up my portion
4994798 when i get out what i usually find are guys laughing at me
4994799 some people spend their money on a boat or an atv or on a camp
4994800 our thing is the hummer and believe me its a lot of fun
4994801 theres nothing like it when the water is coming right over the top of the hood of the hummer
4994802 i have a love for these vehicles in my heart
4994803 i could drive up onto the hood of that car if somebody would let me
4994804 id like to see how these hybrids will hold up after a few years
4994805 youre not saving the environment by driving a toyota prius
4994806 there is an internal combustion engine under the hood just like there is one under the hood of a hummer the question is is one car really morally superior i dont really know the answer but i do know that if you talk to strong proponents of mass transit or of really green living theyll tell you that its just a way to make people feel like theyre doing something for the environment
4994807 simpletech came to us with a desire to create a product that addressed sustainability in a meaningful way this project represented an opportunity to break new ground in an industry that has paid little attention to its impact on the environment
4994808 elastic has grown out of the needs of our clients and the desires of our artists to make pictures and tell stories
4994809 its great to operate as a little studio and produce projects from beginning to end rps a52 and elastic will be working as autonomous companies and a complete digital production studio
4994810 both trevor and alex have created a lot of high profile projects requiring hybrid production approaches
4994811 alex has facilitated projects ranging from broadcast network launches to super bowl spots the plan is for alex to work closely with a52 ep ron cosentino and rps ep cl weaver to present a unified force in offering our clients creative solutions
4994812 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4994813 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4994814 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4994815 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4994816 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4994817 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4994818 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4994819 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4994820 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4994821 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4994822 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4994823 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4994824 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4994825 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4994826 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4994827 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4994828 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4994829 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4994830 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4994831 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4994832 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt
4994833 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4994834 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4994835 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4994836 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4994837 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4994838 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4994839 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4994840 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4994841 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4994842 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4994843 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4994844 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4994845 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4994846 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4994847 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4994848 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
4994849 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4994850 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4994851 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4994852 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4994853 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4994854 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4994855 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4994856 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4994857 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4994858 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
4994859 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
4994860 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
4994861 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
4994862 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
4994863 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
4994864 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
4994865 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
4994866 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
4994867 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4994868 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4994869 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4994870 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4994871 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4994872 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4994873 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4994874 right now though the blog is a mob scene understandable given whats going on and gannett itself tara too bear part of that blame for the unbelievably poor manner with which this was all communicated this isnt five years ago where
4994875 it would be less fun to drop the poking of tara but maybe a lowering of rhetoric given that people are losing their jobs might be good for all sides there are a lot of inept people in all this bad managers scared silly employees hangers on and rubberneckers but most everyone involved yes publishers too are trying to get through this there are a lot of enemies tara isnt one of them
4994876 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4994877 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4994878 posso nunca chegar a ser o melhor engenheiro do mundo mas tenha certeza de
4994879 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4994880 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4994881 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4994882 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4994883 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4994884 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4994885 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions

4994890 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem

4994893 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism

4994981 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4994982 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4994983 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4994984 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4994985 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4994986 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4994987 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4994988 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4994989 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4994990 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4994991 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4994992 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4994993 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4994994 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said

4994999 the existing traffic study has shown to be flawed in many ways
4995000 a lake view can be worth and this is a generalization but a panoramic lake view would probably be worth 300 000 to 500 000
4995001 most people want that lake view even if its a condo and theres a little piece of blue in the corner no bigger than a thumbnail
4995002 usually they come in looking for a lakefront and after i scrape them off the floor they find somewhere where they can be comfortable
4995003 a lake view is of consideration and is almost as important as elevation convenience to amenities that plays into it as well
4995004 then they start sorting out what else they want in a home
4995005 people who have lived here realize they want a lower elevation home they go through the process of finding a home they might settle for an average view with a newer home for example
4995006 those with lake views on the eastern slope are more valuable than lake views on the top of tyner because the eastern slope has better access and larger lots

4995009 i think becoming a town is the next logical step for incline village and will give it more recognition and visibility
4995010 i think having this type of public forum is extremely helpful to disseminate all the misinformation as well as provide the facts on how it the town would work
4995011 i plan to be there as a technical adviser in a way to answer questions a lot from the technical aspect like what makes a gid different from a town
4995012 washoe county is complying with the nevada supreme court order to rebate 38 incline village property owners to reflect assessments based on 2002 03 property values for the 2004 2005 year
4995013 we estimate the total rebate will be about 350 000 including 6 percent interest as directed by the court and the treasurer tells us the target date for mailing those checks is sept 1 2008
4995014 we conclude that nothing significant distinguishes these cases factually or legally from bakst and we therefore affirm the district courts orders granting judicial review declaring the taxpayers 2004 2005 assessments void and setting their assessed values for 2004 2005 to the 2002 2003 levels the taxpayers are entitled to refunds of all excess taxes paid and 6 percent annual interest
4995015 we are going to do all the refunds and then well go from there and see what happens

4995029 dad was very in to sports kayaking canoeing fishing and hunting we spent time together doing sports from the time i was young
4995030 for me sports is therapy and i think its wonderful to have any kind of sport in your background i view the time i spend fishing as my alone time my time to be out in nature its very important to me
4995031 by the time i got to my junior and senior year i realized am i lucky or am i lucky i realized that i loved to learn and was given an amazing opportunity to do so at college something i hope all students realize and take advantage of
4995032 shortly after i moved to incline i met snc founder ben solomon and he had a great vision for a campus in the current location
4995033 so ben put a deal together and i talked the siebens foundation into funding half of it 2 5 million and the deal worked out so well
4995034 my father brought in big speakers from all over the world and felt that was a very important part of the educational experience
4995035 well i was planning to travel with three girlfriends of mine and planned to visit egypt when i read that zahi had discovered what was called the golden mummies
4995036 so i thought ive got to meet this zahi and see those mummies
4995037 he couldnt believe it when i told him wed already arranged for a driver and were ready to go out that day
4995038 he told us we certainly didnt want to stay in a bedouin tent but quickly arranged for us to visit and told us we could stay in a new hotel built near the find and we were the first guests
4995039 he is one of the finest ambassadors for egypt i have ever known
4995040 he knows all about egypt and its history and loves sharing that history with little kids so they can know understand and be proud of their history his love of children is really unbelievable
4995041 ive been all around the world but i find the east to be very interesting places like syria lebanon jordan there is so much history there
4995042 i think funding scholarships is so important because ive always felt that it is one of the best places for money to be spent so students can have the experiences they deserve while studying
4995043 the drive itself was designed because we know at the end of summer people return to their winter homes and clear out their pantry
4995044 we really need it weve been struggling with canned goods
4995045 we try to balance the bags with protein and starches
4995046 theyve been limited by how much they can give us
4995047 theres a food crisis and its a worldwide food crisis the price of food has gone up
4995048 we have more than enough for our partner agencies but not much choice
4995049 right now were not feeling it too bad because its summertime and theres jobs
4995050 but when summer is over and winter hasnt started we got really hit in the spring this year
4995051 we want to be prepared for when summer is over and the jobs are done
4995052 vendors were selected because they exemplified our choices for healthy and natural and promote wellness
4995053 we are fully accredited with all services in one place
4995054 because the lake tahoe community may not be as familiar with the carson cancer center we have produced a video that we feel gives a good snapshot of our center services and staff
4995055 most of us spend very little time in front of the television our lives are all encompassed by our computers we get our news and most of our purchases are done online

4995071 the word of god thus offers us the opportunity to reflect on the universality of the mission of the church made up of peoples of every race and culture this is the origin of the great responsibility of the ecclesial community which is called to be a house of welcome for all the sign and instrument of communion for the entire human family
4995072 it is important above all in our time that every christian community deepen this awareness more and more in part for the sake of helping civil society to overcome any temptation of racism intolerance and exclusion and to organize itself with decisions respectful of the dignity of every human being one of the great achievements of humanity is in fact precisely the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are worrying new signs of this in various countries often connected to social and economic problems which nonetheless can never justify disrespect and racial discrimination let us pray that respect for every person may increase everywhere together with the responsible awareness that only in the reciprocal welcome of all is it possible to build a world marked by authentic justice and true peace
4995073 grow accustomed to this sad reality human life is too valuable and it is unfit for man to die or be crippled by causes that in most cases could be avoided a greater sense of responsibility is certainly necessary above all on the part of drivers because accidents are often due to excessive speed and imprudent behavior driving a vehicle on the public roads requires a moral sense and a civic sense in promoting the latter of these a constant effort of prevention is indispensable the vigilance and deterrence on the part of the competent authorities as the church in fact we feel ourselves directly involved on the ethical level christians first of all must make a personal examination of conscience of their own conduct as drivers the communities should moreover educate all to consider driving as an area in which to defend life and concretely exercise love of neighbor
4995074 the n word nobody talks about that anymore but people dont have the same recognition that calling someone a retard is really very hurtful
4995075 a cheap thrill that gets its humor by demeaning people with disabilities
4995076 by nature of being an r rated comedy its inappropriate at all levels intentionally
4995077 comedy needs the right to be offensive and stiller at least has the courage of his convictions when he uses the word retard its deliberate not casual
4995078 no request has been made for a chris de burgh concert and as a result no authorisation has been granted
4995079 im in a bit of a daze national anthem the flag its a dream come true
4995080 it was unbelievable we knew they would come back but we put the work in early so we could hold on at the finish
4995081 if we have an opportunity to strengthen we will seize it
4995082 our focus is on the premier league and we know how important it is to win the premier league for the fans
4995083 it has been too many years and we are focusing on that it was important to start with a win after the not so very good game in the champions league
4995084 there are two weeks to go in the transfer window and well have added to and strengthened the team by the end of that
4995085 i would hope we get at least another four players in in the next two weeks things are progressing very well on some of those players hopefully by the middle of next week we might have one or two additions
4995086 i now am sure that robinho will stay here so i do not have to get crazy with that there is no concern
4995087 this feeling is truly amazing and its a massive relief i can open the champagne now and rightfully so
4995088 the last downwind was a little scary i kept telling myself dont capsize dont capsize
4995089 there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4995090 without the help of my team mates this isnt possible
4995091 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4995092 nothing thwarts gods purposes more than twisted power nothing renews gods purposes more than redeeming power
4995093 our worship helps us remember this power realignment so we can live differently because of it
4995094 your grace is enough your grace is enough your grace is enough for me
4995095 he who began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it
4995096 you have never looked anyone in the eye that doesnt matter to jesus
4995097 i do that i do that and yes i do that too
4995098 ok god we need you to show up right here but ummm dont stay on stage for too long because we need to allow exactly 35 min for the sermon and then we have another service so
4995099 most of our worship seems to be about us we presume we can worship in a way that will find god yet ignore our neighbor
4995100 expression of human taste what makes the majority happy or satisfied rather than just longing to reflect gods glory
4995101 is that our individual and corporate worship rarely produces the fruit of justice righteousness mercy and humility that god seeks
4995102 the heart of the battle over worship is this our worship practices are separated from our call to do justice love mercy and walk humbly with our god and worse our worship fosters the self indulgent tendencies of our culture rather than nurturing the self sacrificing life of the kingdom of god
4995103 worship is to be the one activity that sums up the scope of our lives
4995104 wakefulness demands too much energy or strength that cannot be mustered or sustained
4995105 the church is asleep not dead not necessarily having trouble breathing but asleep
4995106 why doesnt god answer this prayer and pull me out of this pit has he given up on me
4995107 if god is so good and loving how can he allow poverty hunger and suffering
4995108 why did you allow poeverty hunger and suffering you were to be my instrument
4995109 take a bag of groceries to a poor family at thanksgiving
4995110 live quite contentedly inside the bubble of my middle class american life
4995111 the world is racked with suffering as a consequence of poverty and injustice
4995112 this is the perfect time to make sure residents are ready by checking their hurricane supply kit review evacuation plans and staying informed
4995113 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4995114 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4995115 revenues were going to go up because of increased property values
4995116 i have made a commitment not to raise taxes and i plan to stick to that
4995117 we have to cut services its a tough decision but it has to be made
4995118 government really is to provide the services that people cant provide for themselves
4995119 we have to look at it proposed library programs and parks are probably not the most needed right now
4995120 i like the idea of compromise like keeping them open a couple of days a week
4995121 i think that you have a county manager to do a job
4995122 ive been micromanaged before and that is not fun we need to hire competent people and allow them to do their job
4995123 ive learned how to try to do what is best for everyone
4995124 were a land locked county we cant have a desalination plant

4995126 our budget has really ballooned and there has been some irresponsibility with that
4995127 they are working hard each day to eat that night
4995128 it has been the greatest learning experience ive ever had
4995129 i spent four years learning how government works and putting these plans in place
4995130 i want to ensure that these plans continue im proud we put these plans in place
4995131 people are hurting and everywhere you turn somebody is hurting more than you
4995132 they want to know what government is doing to lessen the burden on them
4995133 every time you put something through the fire it comes out better than its ever been
4995134 were pushed into municipal services because it is good for all of us
4995135 this could enhance the face of polk county the diversity of business helps
4995136 i didnt want the increase but there was an infrastructure gap doing nothing was not an option it wasnt responsible
4995137 i decided i could be a part of this process i can be a part of this and reduce the amount of the increase
4995138 i agreed with the understanding that we would reduce it
4995139 people think the county commission is out of touch with them
4995140 over the last eight or 10 years ive been paying attention and there were things that frustrated me
4995141 i saw this as a ministry so i switched from the premium side to funeral director
4995142 as a local business manager ive had employees to manage
4995143 the ability to give and take and work with people
4995144 if it is in the budget you spend it if it isnt then you dont
4995145 where was the discussion i mean 10 million where was the planning and discussion that would bring it before the public
4995146 i felt the spur of the moment was lack of leadership
4995147 prices are out of reach and impact fees have brought that all about
4995148 there are people in this county who struggle with finances every day they need a commissioner who can feel their pain identify with them and at least listen to them
4995149 we were expecting about 200 children its been a good turnout
4995150 the archdiocese has not contacted me in any way shape or form
4995151 i dont know what the allegations were but as a practicing catholic i was not happy with the way the church handled the sexual abuse scandal
4995152 when it relates to an older child teenagers the recidivism is significantly less
4995153 i think you should still be concerned thats the reality of the situation
4995154 the information age offers much to mankind and i would like to think that we will rise to the challenges it presents but it is vital to remember that information in the sense of raw data is not knowledge that knowledge is not wisdom and that wisdom is not foresight but information is the first essential step to all of these

4995165 in a world where the winners are all connected it is not only the prey who by and large carry little political weight who lose out it is everyone who has not licked the appropriate boots predatory regimes are more or less exactly like protection rackets powerful and feared but neither loved nor respected they cannot reward everyone and therefore they do not enjoy a broad political base in addition they are intrinsically unstable something that does not trouble the predators but makes life for ordinary business enterprise exceptionally trying predators suck the capacity from government and deplete it of the ability to govern in the short run again this looks like simple incompetence but this is an illusion predators do not mind being thought incompetent the accusation helps to obscure their actual agenda

4995209 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
4995210 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
4995211 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
4995212 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization
4995213 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
4995214 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
4995215 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
4995216 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
4995217 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
4995218 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games
4995219 given all the new hair treatments out there theres a growing need to make hair feel more natural especially for women

4995221 the findings will help provide clearer strategies for optimizing hair care products
4995222 the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair care products affect hair to hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion
4995223 im a hands on kinda gal not much of a sit back and watch person

4995252 will this tattoo design still look good in 10 years
4995253 tell her to stay away from the windows stay away from the trees stay away from the trees
4995254 i think that there was a certain combination of being very grounded in who she was what she believed in but also a certain recklessness i think she was always searching for something she wasnt comfortable seeing her life confined to a certain box
4995255 if she saw animals being treated cruelly or children in the news or a sad movie or if she felt like she wasnt being understood in a conversation
4995256 she was very capable she went out on the back of a motorcycle and did rigorous fieldwork her research was responsible and penetrating she saw the heart of a problem and she knew whom to hold accountable
4995257 weve created stability for our kids in a way that my mom didnt do for us
4995258 my choosing to put down roots in chicago and marry a woman who is very rooted in one place probably indicates a desire for stability that maybe i was missing
4995259 she was a very intelligent quiet girl interested in her friendships and current events
4995260 she wasnt particularly interested in children or in getting married
4995261 that the depiction of childlike blacks i was now seeing on the screen was what my mother had carried with her to hawaii all those years before a reflection of the simple fantasies that had been forbidden to a white middle class girl from kansas the promise of another life warm sensual exotic different
4995262 everything was oratory from him even the most commonplace observation
4995263 everyone had an opinion about everything and everyone was of the opinion that everyone wanted to hear their opinion no one more so than barack
4995264 she was scarcely out of high school she was mostly kind of an observer
4995265 my mother was that girl with the movie of beautiful black people playing in her head
4995266 i never probed my mother about the details did they decide to get married because she was already pregnant or did he propose to her in the traditional formal way
4995267 i suppose had she not passed away i would have asked more
4995268 he was a man of his time from a very patriarchal society
4995269 walking off the plane the tarmac rippling with heat the sun bright as a furnace
4995270 that got the kids laughing and then they all played together
4995271 my mother whose parents were nonpracticing baptists and methodists was one of the most spiritual souls i ever knew
4995272 but she had a healthy skepticism of religion as an institution and as a consequence so did i
4995273 she was very much of the early dr martin luther king era
4995274 she believed that people were all basically the same under their skin that bigotry of any sort was wrong and that the goal was then to treat everybody as unique individuals
4995275 a pretty black girl with braids an inuit sacagawea a little dutch boy with clogs
4995276 but when i think about the fact that i was separated from her i suspect it had more of an impact than i know
4995277 colonial powers were collapsing countries needed help and development work was beginning to interest anthropologists
4995278 she was no pollyanna there have certainly been moments when she complained to us
4995279 but she was not someone who would take the detritus of those divorces and make judgments about men in general or love or allow herself to grow pessimistic
4995280 she kept a certain part of herself aloof or removed
4995281 i think maybe in some way this was how she managed to cross so many boundaries
4995282 she was influenced by hanging out in the javanese marketplace
4995283 where she would see women with heavy baskets on their backs who got up at 3 in the morning to walk to the market and sell their produce
4995284 she had compared with other foundation colleagues a much more eclectic circle
4995285 she spoke mostly in positive terms what we are trying to do and what we can do
4995286 i inherited that i think from her she was suspicious of cant
4995287 her memory loomed over me is this something that she would trust
4995288 i dont think she was entirely comfortable with the more aggressive or militant approaches to african american politics
4995289 for someone like ann who had a big personality and was a big presence
4995290 indonesia was very accepting it gave her a sense of fitting in
4995291 but she didnt make a big deal out of it
4995292 i would say her work had a lot to do with the success of the program
4995293 all of us knew where barack was going to school all of us knew how brilliant he was
4995294 probably need a camel caravan and an elephant or two to load all our bags on the plane and im sure you dont want to see all those airline agents weeping and rending their garments
4995295 trunks full of batiks that we dont really know what to do with
4995296 and to barack and maya who seldom complained when their mother was in the field
4995297 she just said it was something he had to work out

4995314 el hecho de que la vigente ley 2 2007 de 15 de marzo haya tipificado las denominadas sociedades profesionales no constituye un obst culo al reconocimiento legal de otras agrupaciones profesionales que aun enmarcadas en el mbito societario y denominadas doctrinalmente
4995315 las sociedades deber n tener por objeto nico y exclusivo la actividad profesional de que se trate ahora bien se trata de objeto nico y exclusivo en cuanto a la actividad profesional a desarrollar pero no en cuanto a que la sociedad deba tener una nica actividad es decir la sociedad podr tener varias actividades profesionales siempre que esas actividades profesionales no sean incompatibles entre s
4995316 la primera de las cuestiones planteadas en este recurso por referirse al objeto social de una sociedad profesional es de crucial importancia para la caracterizaci n de esta figura
4995317 nicamente podr n tener por objeto el ejercicio en com n de actividades profesionales por otra parte nada impide que la sociedad profesional ejerza varias actividades profesionales cuyo desempe o no haya sido legal o reglamentariamente declarado incompatible

4995399 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4995400 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4995401 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4995402 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4995406 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4995407 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4995408 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4995409 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4995410 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4995411 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4995412 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4995413 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4995414 this is a planning took where all things are going
4995415 you must remember that base ball as played by the detroit champions and the baltimores is not the same article the game like all things has progressed and it is to day more scientific than 10 years ago it requires more thought and head work it is in some respects like checkers and chess
4995416 fred dunlap was at one time i refer to his engagement at cleveland before he came to detroit the best second baseman in the country taking his fielding batting base running and headwork into consideration he was undoubtedly superior to heinie reitz or joe quinn of the orioles with the exception of second base therefore the baltimore infield is faster of the two
4995417 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4995418 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4995419 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4995420 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4995421 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4995422 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4995423 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4995424 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4995425 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4995426 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4995427 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4995428 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4995429 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4995430 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4995431 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4995432 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4995433 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4995434 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4995435 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4995436 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4995437 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4995438 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4995439 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4995440 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4995441 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4995442 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4995443 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4995444 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4995445 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4995446 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4995447 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4995448 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4995449 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4995450 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4995451 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4995452 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4995453 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4995454 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4995455 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4995456 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4995457 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4995458 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4995459 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4995460 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4995461 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4995462 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4995463 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4995464 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again

4995472 where planned obsolescence leaves off psychological obsolescence takes over we are made to feel ashamed to wear clothes or drive cars until they are worn out the mass media have convinced us that to be out of step with fashion is to be out of step with reality it is time we awaken to the fact that conformity to a sick society is to be sick
4995473 he is such a low life there are plenty of men out there better than him
4995474 it was a good result for nick it was his first stakes winner its the first of many group winners for him
4995475 we had a few hiccups in the autumn but i think she is back
4995476 he obviously likes having the blinkers on and the good news is that he got through the ground which for perth horses is a bonus
4995477 he was very plain there was no real excuses maybe the track but it was pretty ordinary
4995478 el presidente como comandante en jefe es en ltima instancia responsable por los contratistas en el campo de batalla y es decepcionante que esta administraci n no haya tenido la voluntad de dejar eso en claro en el tribunal
4995479 esa aparente falta de inter s ratifica nuestra conclusi n de que el caso no presenta un costado pol tico
4995480 restringe la supervisi n y la rendici n de cuentas abre la puerta para la corrupci n y el abuso y en algunas instancias puede incrementar significativamente el costo pagado por los contribuyentes estadounidenses
4995481 lo que desaf a mi imaginaci n es c mo personas adultas y formales pueden estar dispuestas a desviar esa cantidad de recursos financieros de estados unidos hacia las cuentas bancarias de empresas privadas cuyas actividades son opacas para los contribuyentes y en su mayor parte no sujetas a rendici n de cuentas
4995482 esta magnitud de gastos en contratistas privados es especialmente llamativa a la luz de los recientes informes gubernamentales y de los medios de prensa sobre fallas en la agencia de auditor a de contratos de defensa
4995483 los intereses de los contribuyentes estadounidenses est sufriendo aparentemente una serie de impedimentos
4995484 hasta hace unos a os predominaban las interferencias graves como la persecuci n la censura directa o el asesinato de periodistas ahora esas formas est n en retirada afortunadamente y afloran otras menos ostensibles pero igualmente da inas
4995485 el precio del silencio uso y abuso de la publicidad oficial y otras formas de censura indirecta en am rica latina
4995486 no podemos decir que el criterio fue tomar los casos peores de ninguna manera
4995487 muchos gobiernos de la regi n utilizan sistem ticamente contratos publicitarios para recompensar o castigar a medios por sus contenidos
4995488 no hay normas que proh ban espec ficamente la discriminaci n
4995489 aqu el gobierno pretende darte un contrato de publicidad para callarte la boca
4995490 el gobierno nacional suele hacer pagos generosos en concepto de publicidad a periodistas de medios gr ficos nacionales influyentes que tienen programas de radio o televisi n por cable con bajos niveles de audiencia
4995491 el gobierno nacional abusa sistem ticamente de sus facultades en materia de publicidad oficial y asignaci n excesiva de pauta a medios afines
4995492 autocensura que inhibe a redacciones enteras y es capaz de acallar hasta a los periodistas m s valientes
4995493 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4995494 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4995495 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4995496 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4995497 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4995498 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4995499 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4995500 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4995501 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4995502 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4995503 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4995504 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4995505 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4995506 we have no guarantee that the russians will keep to their agreement
4995507 the administration will take measures to economically empower the family besides we will take care for her treatment
4995508 were hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
4995509 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4995510 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4995511 they the ruling national democratic alliance in bihar are all suffering from lalu phobia despite the fact that the rashtriya janata dal rjd lalu prasads party was ousted from power in bihar in 2005
4995512 i am sure that i and my party are giving sleepless nights to the nda it is the reason why the nda leaders keep harping that the rjd will not be able to win even one seat in the coming parliamentary elections
4995513 it is part of a conspiracy to defame me just before the parliamentary elections
4995514 i have given all details to the income tax department all property that i possess is in the knowledge of the income tax department a copy of which is also with the prime minister and the government of india my detractors are welcome to re check their facts

4995541 ive seen a much higher prevalence of those types of big attention grabber promotions this season
4995542 the 1 cent deals the bundling of products or three for two deals ive seen a lot of that much more than in the past
4995543 now i just need to find the 9 cent filler paper and 33 cent index cards
4995544 with the high price of gas and food this summer it is absolutely necessary for me to try to save money on back to school shopping
4995545 that means reusing last years scissors and markers and even the old spiral notebooks that have only a few pages used
4995546 their sweet spot within the customer framework are items below 10 and items that customers are familiar with
4995547 and they then will discover the wide range of products we have
4995548 the value of the dollar is shrinking so we are much more of a bargain than we were in the past
4995549 if you compare the euro or the yuan to the dollar it is much easier for people to come here to get a business education at a great discount

4995586 stefan deinen zweiten platz auf dem sachsenring hast du ausgelassen gefeiert beim ersten sieg am sonntag in br nn hast du verglichen damit eher in sich gekehrt gewirkt
4995587 das war ein ganz spezieller moment extrem unglaublich da musste ich erst einmal zu mir kommen ich habe auf eine fahne f r die ehrenrunde gewartet aber es kam keine doch das war okay so konnte ich alles ganz in ruhe genie en
4995588 du hast das rennen sehr souver n nach hause gefahren und dabei wm spitzenreiter mike di meglio problemlos in schach gehalten wann wurde dir klar dass der erste sieg heute wirklich m glich ist
4995589 in den letzten runden hat der kopf nicht mehr gemacht was ich wollte da bin ich in gedanken schon die sieger interviews durchgegangen
4995590 mir haben schon einige anderer fahrer gesagt dass das beim ersten sieg so passieren wird es war trotzdem ein fehler aber ich habe es ja noch gut hinbekommen vor jahren hat hier mein vater gewonnen nun gibt es zwei gp sieger in meiner familie
4995591 in der wm wertung bist du auf rang drei vorger ckt tr umst du noch vom titel
4995592 nein der titel ist weg 60 punkte bei sechs rennen sind zu viel aber in diesem jahr bleibt das ziel in jedem rennen aufs podium zu fahren und n chstes jahr wollen wir in der wm unter die ersten drei und vielleicht sogar weltmeister werden
4995593 hast du schon eine ahnung wie team familie oder freunde diesen sieg mit dir feiern werden
4995594 das lasse ich ganz auf mich zukommen ich bin sicher sie werden sich was einfallen lassen aber das ist zum gl ck nicht mein job

4995601 i trace this to a certain selfishness on my part
4995602 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4995603 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of the constitution
4995604 this nomination should be based on the criteria on a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench

4995608 we know very well that the inguri hydropower plant supplies electricity to dozens of thousands of georgian and abkhaz homes and we are well aware that strategic facilities of this kind could be targeted in provocations and even terror attacks
4995609 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
4995610 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
4995611 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
4995612 were hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
4995613 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4995614 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4995615 the term spitzian might be outdated now by the phelpsian feat
4995616 it will always be an amazing accomplishment in the swimming world and also the olympics being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when you were tired and didnt want to be there when you just wanted to go home and sleep through the workout it made those days easier id look at him and say well i want to do this its something ive wanted to do and im thankful for having him do what he did
4995617 in an era of such great swimmers i think watching phelps win eight gold medals has been my highlight
4995618 i just dont think there is a perspective for him
4995619 hes beyond everything we know in athens when he was going for eight golds i said it would never happen not in this day and age with semifinal swims and the competition level phelps has taken every expectation and broken it he seems to be the only guy who sees the impossible as possible and thats what makes him the best once he crosses the threshold other people are able to foresee it happening if he can do it we can do it but hes always one step ahead of us
4995620 i thought he would win six or seven but with a little bit of luck hed probably get eight
4995621 die russischen streitkr fte haben sich zwar von einigen bisherigen st tzpunkten zur ckgezogen aber daf r neue strategisch wichtige positionen bezogen sie besetzen jetzt mehr land als vorher
4995622 das macht mich skeptisch warum sollten sie das tun wenn sie nicht vorh tten l nger hier zu bleiben
4995623 deshalb ist die versorgungslage katastrophal die gesch fte bleiben geschlossen weil ihre eigent mer angst vor pl nderungen haben
4995624 wenn die russen zu dem schluss kommen sie k nnten die usa und ihre partner spalten wird dies schwerwiegende folgen f r die nato haben wir w ren dann an einem sehr kritischen punkt
4995625 es ist jetzt ganz entscheidend dass sich die russen wirklich aus georgien zur ckziehen wenn sie das nicht tun werden die konsequenzen sehr weit reichend sein

4995635 in my 24 years of elected office i have never before been to more town halls more places where everyone is more concerned about one issue
4995636 its the associated rise in prices across the board the price of a loaf of bread the price of a gallon of milk people in my neck of the woods have already cut back as much as they can theyre carpooling not taking that summer vacation cutting out the unnecessary car trips
4995637 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
4995638 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4995639 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4995640 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4995641 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4995642 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4995643 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4995644 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4995645 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4995646 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4995647 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4995648 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4995649 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4995650 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4995651 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4995652 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4995653 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4995654 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4995655 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4995656 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4995657 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4995658 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4995659 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4995660 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4995661 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
4995662 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
4995663 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
4995664 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
4995665 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
4995666 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games

4995672 we have done everything by the book and andrew was at the game and the chairman jim kerr and i will sit down with him and his agent
4995673 we have been after andrew for a long time and my assistant bryan mclaughlin has done a lot of hard work to get us to this situation
4995674 after hamilton told us they wanted to keep the player after we made an offer some time ago we were approached by the hamilton but i know other clubs are interested and im sure his agent will be looking to get him the best deal possible
4995675 but the reality of the situation is that we have been pursuing andrew we would very much like him here and we have told him that
4995676 we want him here as much as we wanted kevin kelbie here but ultimately it will be up to him
4995677 but even if we do sign andrew our search continues
4995678 we need one more forward player if not two and we will keep looking
4995679 last week has gone now and i took the decision because i didnt see there being a dangers to the players and the ball was rolling
4995680 but as the game went on i was in constant contact with my assistants and after half an hour it was becoming a farce and there was a danger to the players so i stopped it immediately
4995681 it didnt matter that linfield were 1 0 up at the time as far as i was concerned the game would have been a farce and the players safety was the most important thing
4995682 any one of us can have a terrible day of trauma but since that day every day for us is august 15
4995683 you have your memories and you think of what should have been and what actually is you have to accept what happened and come to terms with it
4995684 it does hurt me to go on flights and see an air hostess walking down the aisle lorraine could have been on a flight we were travelling on
4995685 its other things too having a family passing her driving test christmas presents all these issues its ongoing my eldest daughter denise got married and lorraine wasnt here to be her bridesmaid
4995686 we have a granddaughter now and lorraines not here to greet her we have all these things to deal with
4995687 my wife ann would stand in the corner not speaking and i couldnt stop crying i had ulcers in my eyes
4995688 i drove round country roads at high speed but i realised the hurt it would have caused my family youre broken and you want to get away from the pain your head is in a state of turmoil and shock
4995689 you still get days of desperation and you feel loneliness which does drag you down
4995690 i can still see her laid out with the water running from her clothes and her face full of shrapnel the shock of that when your eyes have seen something like that the picture never goes away
4995691 it brings tears to my eyes to talk about this situation but i feel the world has to know what terrorism can do to people
4995692 the people in power cant get the people who did this and thats hurtful the only thing i want and my family wants is justice
4995693 the fact that i was not asked for my opinion has caused me a great deal of pain and hurt
4995694 i dont pass my wifes shop and my family dont pass it this is not closure its confrontation
4995695 its 15 feet away from the shop and i dont know why this wasnt thought out thats the spot where people fell and died and were hurt and i include those people who were traumatised
4995696 i still dont have a monument on her grave i already have her monuments they are our two children our grandchildren and our great grandchildren
4995697 my wife was a very serene woman she was a very good wife and mother and the sad thing is she would have made a great grandmother
4995698 ive broken my health but thats of no importance as you get older its libby that im worried about
4995699 you cant get closure if she had died by gods hands that would have been different but someone took her right to life
4995700 im sure that in the future we will get justice of some sort im very very determined
4995701 is a question for the south ossetian government we are here supporting the south ossetian side we arent here to secure the city
4995702 the army does not carry out police functions we are a military army
4995703 we are filling out these forms so that people know there was a genocide here
4995704 we are writing so that people know exactly what happened here
4995705 we want to speak to children and get the message across to them that if they get into trouble when they are young it will affect the rest of their lives
4995706 the psni officers are guiding us on how best to go about setting up the scheme and have expressed an interest in getting involved by talking to the kids about the dangers of drugs
4995707 myself and paul would hope to talk about crime and the consequences sharing our experiences with the school kids
4995708 all i was interested in was drinking and fighting and i had this great big chip on my shoulder
4995709 i was rioting with the police and throwing petrol bombs at them everyone in our area was doing it at the time
4995710 my life was never normal until i was 36 and gave my life to jesus
4995711 since then i have got my driving licence bought my first car and my first house and even been on holiday for the first time
4995712 up until then i never cared about anybody else and i say this regretfully not boastfully
4995713 i have three children in belfast who dont want anything to do with me and i cant blame them as i was never there when they needed me
4995714 i am not proud of my past and i cant change it but i can change my future and only with the help of christ who sacrificed everything on the cross
4995715 i had been carrying out robberies for the sake of it from i was in my early teens when i left home and lived in that derelict house i had to steal to get what i needed
4995716 i started carrying out attacks for the paramilitaries rioting and so on and in return i got to stay in their houses for periods of time
4995717 i never actually joined any organisation but was always on the fringes
4995718 i was 19 and it really hit home that jesus loved me and died for me and wanted to give me a real life a full life
4995719 i decided something would have to be done and i got some boys together to carry out a robbery in ballymoney
4995720 i was going to use the money to buy a weapon to shoot jonathans killer it was my intention to get involved in the feud to get my revenge
4995721 if i hadnt been caught and sent to prison i am sure i would have done murder
4995722 in maghaberry i wanted to be a tough guy and a real menace and spent most of my time in the punishment unit
4995723 i had a lot of anger in me and although i knew my life was in a mess i thought i was in control
4995724 we want to help give these people a second chance
4995725 we want them to know there is somebody there who cares about their families and helping them get back to normality
4995726 we will be setting up a drop in centre in lurgan and on the shore road in belfast to offer a cup of tea and to help them fill in forms
4995727 and as many of them have literacy problems we are looking at the possibility of having a teacher coming in to do adult education i have been in their shoes and i have been where they are who better to talk to prisoners than ex prisoners
4995728 as well as hopefully giving practical help for us one of the most important parts of what we are doing and what we hope to do with the prisoners and school children is to help people to see that jesus is the answer to all our problems and that prayer changes things
4995729 we are aware of the proposals being considered and have offered only advice with no other direct involvement
4995730 we would consider getting involved with the scheme and welcome anything aimed at reducing crime and making northern ireland a safer place to live
4995731 ive got the x factor weve got the x factor glasgows got the x factor scotlands got the x factor wee hamish over there has the x factor
4995732 its illuminating to find out what the big boys are earning at a time when ordinary staff are facing job cuts to plug a budget shortfall
4995733 were feeling the squeeze big time but the current round of redundancies havent affected those at the top
4995734 he was huge and it took the police and the firefighters ages to get him out
4995735 some of the boys knew him and his background but they still had to do a professional job
4995736 its no coincidence that he was due to appear in court on the monday and because he was so worried he took some pills to ease his pain
4995737 some people believe it may have been an attempt by him to be sent to hospital but because of the state of his health he ended up killing himself
4995738 the house was in a terrible state and there were porn magazines and cats everywhere hes certainly one of the biggest people theyve managed to get out of a house
4995739 people are convinced there are more victims out there and were just relieved he wont be able to attack any more innocent children
4995740 the funeral of mr corry was conducted in saul church by a visiting rector mr corrys family met briefly with the rector immediately prior to the funeral and provided details of his work with the red cross and the udr the rector was not aware of the charges facing mr corry or of his previous convictions
4995741 for the life of me i cant image that being a proportionate response to the charge that georgia has attacked russian peacekeepers
4995742 its hard for us to understand what russias plan is here
4995743 i do sense an emerging unified view among our key allies
4995744 towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict
4995745 we think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction

4995756 americans have not stopped going out to eat and arent going to stop but they are being forced to decide
4995757 their discretionary income pool is smaller so if a restaurant isnt on their personal a or b list they will drop it
4995758 the restaurant industry is overstored especially in casual dining with demand nowhere near the increased supply of stores over the past five years
4995759 the companies could get the money so they opened up the stores
4995760 these stocks are very very very cheap because their fundamentals keep getting a little worse
4995761 but if you have a time horizon of two or more years at some point theyre going to have a big big recovery
4995762 we could be close to a bottom for the restaurant stocks though the businesses themselves will continue to have a tough time the rest of this year and into 2009
4995763 yet a lot of the higher quality companies with strong brands balance sheets and management teams will survive and be well positioned when the economy turns around
4995764 many of the independent restaurants which are locally owned and operated have managed to do just fine in the current environment
4995765 they arent big and dont have a lot of marketing muscle but they are able to compete with the things they can control like service and commitment to customer satisfaction

4995767 it is over three weeks since we learned that the portuguese authorities had closed the investigation to find madeleine lifted our arguido status and ended judicial secrecy
4995768 it will be clear to everyone now that there is absolutely no evidence that suggests madeleine has been seriously harmed
4995769 knowing this we strongly believe that madeleine is out there and can be found
4995770 of course whoever is responsible for madeleines abduction must and can be found to prevent them from putting another child and family through the misery we have suffered
4995771 we have always believed that this heinous crime could be solved with the help of the public
4995772 our investigators continue to explore credible leads and will continue to do so as long as madeleine is missing
4995773 now that the authorities are no longer looking for madeleine we implore everyone who has provided information to the enquiry to contact us

4995777 you can stand by for some pretty big news in the not to distant future
4995778 i was accused of assaulting a child in the street but this case should never have been brought to court
4995779 i cant believe this happened to us and we should not have to live like this for the rest of our lives we were terrified when the windows came in
4995780 it could be something to do with my court case or something to do with eamonn but i just dont know
4995781 this intimidation has been going on for about 13 years now and when we think it has stopped for a few months something like this happens
4995782 some of the kids in the street have been making our lives a misery but im not going to be bullied by them they are urinating and drinking but nothings ever done about it
4995783 we also believe that there are people who want us out of our home because they dont want to see two pensioners living in a four bedroom house but its our right to live wherever we choose
4995784 the only reason we cant escape this nightmare is because we dont have the resources and because we spent a lot of money on this property
4995785 we love the house but these people are making are lives a misery and we just want to be left alone
4995786 we work tirelessly in the downpatrick area to stamp out this type of activity and i would urge councillors in killyleagh to use their influence to help bring these types of attacks to an end
4995787 this couple have been subjected to a campaign of intimidation for a number of years and it must end now

4995791 people have been trying to upset what we are trying to achieve at blackburn even before my first season as a manager in the top flight had even started but that has been dispelled by this result
4995792 it hasnt upset me nothing upsets me things annoy me but dont upset me
4995793 it wasnt only because of what was being said about myself because i have dealt with a load of crap throughout my career just the way it tried to unsettle what i was trying to achieve
4995794 and for someone facing his first job in the premier league it was wrong attempts were made to upset things before things had even started
4995795 the season had not even started and things were being said that were bang out of order
4995796 there seemed to be an attempt to unsettle myself the players and the staff we have a good bunch of lads and we have stayed strong people could see that against everton
4995797 do i know the source of what was said no i dont but it was wrong and it was out of order
4995798 i was a bit unsure what to expect i have played in the premier league for a long time and know what is about but as a manager i was unsure
4995799 it was an eye opener for me i was happy with three points and the experience of being a manager in the top flight was tremendous
4995800 it was a deserved victory no doubt we were a bit sloppy and disappointed after the break having been hit by a very late sucker punch with their equaliser
4995801 but we needed to salvage something and did that very well we were 2 1 down to a team that finished fifth last season and nobody outside the top four won at everton last term
4995802 it showed what spirit and togetherness we have at this club i was very pleased with what i saw and the win
4995803 it was nice but we always had confidence there has been a lot of crap spouted about things that are supposedly going on at blackburn there has been attempts to unsettle my players
4995804 we worked hard to get back into the game and then go ahead then expected the experienced defenders we had to make sure that was how it remained but they did not do that
4995805 it is a lot to ask a 16 year old to come on and change a game but we have a history of that at everton with wayne rooney and james vaughan
4995806 the two lads we did put on rodwell and baxter did really well and we are very pleased with them
4995807 but it is not the right time to be playing either of them we would rather use them coming into a side that is playing well and winning
4995808 these boys need time to develop sometimes though the first team is where that happens
4995809 there was a lot of pressure on jose when he came on and he did get a big build up but maybe everton fans need something to cheer and support
4995810 everton fans needed some good news and at the moment that is rodwell and baxter we hope they have the mentality to cope we will do our best to protect them and use them at the right moments

4995916 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4995917 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4995918 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4995919 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4995920 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4995921 i think theyre very similar to a typical newsletter we would send out
4995922 all of us kept telling each other we shouldnt be doing this
4995923 my mind set the whole time was why are we doing this
4995924 we immediately instituted a search for the defendant in order to absolve ourselves of liability
4995925 i got caught up in this i made a bad judgment im a screw up
4995926 asked what he did to earn an income roque reluctantly said he was a drug dealer
4995927 he said i dont fight or destroy people he said that he had a lot of friends and that they owed him
4995928 he portrayed himself as a modern day robin hood he said that he is known on the street as cuba he said that he helped people in various ways to include paying their rent and that his assistance was sometimes offered via illegal activities
4995929 roque said that he could provide information on organized crime narcotics and other illicit activity
4995930 he said that he also had information on the whereabouts of what he described as a united states army missile
4995931 detective hayes informed me and mike savant that she was going to take defendant and book him into pierce county jail
4995932 i overheard her ask one of the unknown federal officers to book defendant into jail on her behalf
4995933 liberty bail bonds personnel relinquished custody of roque to us and we were allowed to transport him to tacoma police headquarters to meet with federal agents
4995934 roque agreed to assist on the condition that he could be at home with his daughters
4995935 we explained that we could not make any promises to him and he was told that even if he didnt go to jail state charges could be filed later

4995938 i dont want to underplay the danger but its unlikely that there was an immediate danger to anybody in the neighborhood
4995939 mark came back and said to me well im not signing off on this
4995940 he told me that there was no way that he was in agreement that this was a valid surrender
4995941 in this particular case i didnt think it was worth letting go of a good bond
4995942 the surrender shall be made to the facility in which the person was originally held in custody or the county or city jail affiliated with the court issuing the warrant resulting in bail
4995943 once the bondsman surrenders the defendant at the jail the bondsman is off the hook
4995944 youve got a prosecutor who doesnt see the gray in the world
4995945 hes never worked on the other side to experience and understand the street smarts of it how things work the letter of the law doesnt necessarily incorporate the practical application of things
4995946 i wish it was only 10 000 and we could have rolled the dice and let a court of law decide but it was 150 000 and with that comes consequences

4995960 in the past the answer would have been no this is not a proxy conflict between great powers but increasingly the answer is becoming yes
4995961 even yesterday was big for me because it had been such a long time since i won three matches in a row so to get into the final is another great thing
4995962 new haven was a good experience after that final i played really well for the next couple of months so hopefully i can get that kind of confidence here
4995963 we know each others games so well because weve been playing each other since we were very young
4995964 everything was going my way in the third set shes maybe not at the same level as when she was no 1 but shes always a tough competitor
4995965 its disappointing to have an up and down match like this after the ones i played this week
4995966 but the reason i came here was to get matches so thats definitely a benefit for the us open coming up she was just too good in the third set i did my best today
4995967 in the beginning i felt very flat i had no energy and really struggled in the rallies
4995968 but then everything changed from the beginning of the second set i was able to step it up a little bit and i think it threw her rhythm off
4995969 we were really focused from the very first point we really wanted to win and we knew this was a really tough tournament but we never gave up we had to be focused
4995970 the olympics is truly about participation but its also about your moment in time today my moment in time was with my sister who i love almost more than anyone in the world its just amazing to think that we could participate and bring home a gold medal and i am so excited i cant even speak
4995971 to be honest it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister i mean we are practically joined together its really unexplainable i have chill bumps
4995972 i believe in truth and of all that is me

4995985 they have a big pipeline of redevelopments that are opening in the next year or so at a time when retailer appetite for opening new space is pretty low
4995986 it was a pretty solid bet that if you built the mall you got two department stores to decide to go into a piece of property and you put a bunch of stores in between them you enclosed them in air conditioning that you know youd just sit back and clip coupons right not a bad deal
4995987 they built the court adjacent to that property i think thats a good example of a mall owner that has grown with the times now its just a juggernaut thats very difficult to compete against

4996094 it appears that jesus has been turned he has been confronted with and has learned the meaning of his own teaching concerning mercy see for example mt 5 7 9 13 12 7 23 23 in this narrative the israelite is conquered by the canaanite
4996095 if jesus restricted his ministry to the insiders then so can we

4996110 dance may be an appropriate and effective strategy for improving functional mobility deficits in people who are living with brain disorders such as parkinsons stroke and traumatic brain injuries
4996111 medications are important in the treatment of parkinsons but many symptoms dont respond as well to medications as we would like
4996112 music and other rhythmic stimuli help parkinsons patients to move better so dance may help patients regain balance and make more fluid movements the thought is that by moving to music the brain will reinforce movement pathways or simply create new ones dance also may help the fight against depression seen in parkinsons disease
4996113 dance for me has always been therapeutic in many ways although its important to note that this is not a therapy session this is a dance class that combines the artistry of dance with live music to encourage ones natural instincts for movement and the benefits that movement can produce physically and socially its an opportunity for participants and their loved ones to do something fun together

4996255 for this reason god gave them over to degrading passions for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error 28and just as they did not see fit to acknowledge god any longer god gave them over to a depraved mind to do those things which are not proper

4996275 in the first year the national piano manufacturers association recommends that you have your piano tuned four times this is a period of environmental adjustment for a new instrument and proper attention is important after the first year the piano should be tuned at least twice each year depending upon the frequency of use and atmospheric conditions
4996276 due to string stretching settling and the effects of climate a new piano should receive at least four tunings in the first year after that the type of use and the location of the piano will dictate the number of tunings required but kawai recommends two tunings per year as a minimum
4996277 changes in temperature and humidity the amount and type of use it gets and the musical requirements of the owner will determine how often your pearl river piano will need service in general pearl river recommends that your new piano be serviced four times the first year and twice a year by a qualified piano technician
4996278 we recommend two to three tunings the first year and a minimum of two tunings per year thereafter avoid placing your piano where it will be exposed to extreme heat or cold moisture or direct sunlight all of which can cause unstable tuning warpage and finish damage
4996279 as a rule a brand new piano should depending on its location and climatic conditions be tuned two to three times in the first year or two an instrument played often and intensively could require additional tunings
4996280 we recommend that your tuner be called at least 3 or 4 times a year you however are the final judge and should have the piano tuned as often as you think necessary to put the matter of tuning into perspective remember that a concert piano is tuned before every performance and a piano in a professional recording studio where it is in constant use is tuned 3 or 4 times each week as a matter of course
4996281 new pianos should be tuned a minimum of four times the first year to compensate for the normal settling that takes place subsequently as a matter of standard maintenance a piano should be tuned at least twice a year of course some musicians will choose to have their own piano tuned more often to satisfy their own personal musical requirements
4996282 due to the natural elasticity in new piano strings we recommend that your instrument be tuned two to four times the first year twice the second year and a minimum of once per year thereafter

4996392 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago

4996405 i think ill be a clown when i get grown

4996407 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
4996408 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman
4996409 one of the things if you are a person of faith like me i believe that things will work out and we will get the president that we need
4996410 i trust in the american people they are going to make a good decision
4996411 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
4996412 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4996413 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4996414 what i traced this to is a certain selfishness on my part
4996415 i was so obsessed with me and you know the reasons that i might be dissatisfied that i couldnt focus on other people
4996416 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
4996417 this nomination should be based on the criteria of a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench
4996418 some of the worst damage has been done by legislating from the bench
4996419 you know if youve got book sales of 25 million
4996420 theyre going to make a good decision and were going to be able to solve the big problems that we face
4996421 there will be no problem about a new contract for gary
4996422 he will be up for a new deal you can be sure about that because hes a remarkable person
4996423 the way he has come back after 18 months is remarkable and to then play to the level he played against portsmouth last sunday was perfect
4996424 but it is going to be difficult for gary to get into the team when you think about what kind of season wes brown had last year then there is the young lad rafael da silva hes a player
4996425 we have made an offer to fulham for moritz volz and it has been accepted
4996426 there are two weeks to go in the transfer window and well have added to and strengthened the team by the end of that
4996427 i would hope we get at least another four players in in the next two weeks things are progressing very well on some of those players
4996428 hopefully by the middle of next week we might have one or two additions
4996429 when i turn around and look at my bench at times i think we could do with some of the quality on the pitch sitting behind me and some better quality on the field
4996430 everything is in place borja is leaving for west bromwich and he wants to move
4996431 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4996432 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4996433 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4996434 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4996435 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4996436 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4996437 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4996438 i told everyone i had a hunch that i was going to play gasquet last night and this morning
4996439 and then you know we say the first warm up session which is normally when you find out and mathieu was out there hitting there was no sign of richard
4996440 i dont think it would have matter the way i played today no
4996441 guy called me last night and asked if i was ready to play
4996442 i told him that i was feeling a little bit tired after the match of friday but you always think you know you have a chance
4996443 it definitely wont be like that if anyone leaves it will be the managers decision
4996444 mark hughes wont settle for anything else thats exactly how every football club should be run we wont be made weaker by business decisions
4996445 i presume it was the managers belief when he came here that he wouldnt just be coming for one year he obviously feels hes here for the long haul
4996446 there was a lot of shock when sven goran eriksson left there was a time in the season when he was being offered a job for life so for that to turn around and him not to have a job at all left the players wondering what was going on
4996447 i genuinely believe the future is good the stuff in the paper is nothing new at manchester city it happens all the time
4996448 i have decided that i will play the davis cup tie this september against belgium
4996449 im looking forward to the opportunity to help switzerland along with my teammates get back into the world group for the 2009 season i was so excited that the team was able to pull it out in belarus last weekend and very much hope we can carry this momentum into the tie in september
4996450 its been a tough job because all the bids were magnificient and shows the enourmous interest and passion for the team across spain unfortunately we have to make a preliminary selection but we want to encourage everyone to continue to support the team in future
4996451 i havent yet made up the plan exactly for next year
4996452 but i think im definitely going to play the first round next year and that hopefully will be in the world group after beating belgium in the relegation round
4996453 i always have been i love team competition basketball soccer its always something ive enjoyed doing when i got my first davis cup nomination when i was 16 it was for me the greatest thing when i play davis cup the atmosphere in the team is important its really key and we have that thats why stan and i had such a good understanding of each other today on the court and throughout the whole week its something weve been trying to build up for many years
4996454 that being said nadal has won a couple clay court matches since then also im sure hes licking his chops because its gonna be nice conditions for him so hell show
4996455 i think ive become a better davis cup player i still have a lot to prove on clay and im not going to try to tell you that im fixed and great on clay and all this stuff but im better in davis cup situations and im better in away tie situations so you know thats not gonna hurt
4996456 wed like to take on usa again partly because well be at home for that one
4996457 we gave it everything we had against them last year and it didnt quite come off well be eager to have another go at them
4996458 i really want to congratulate the players for the effort they put in and not just the ones here we also won in peru with nicolas almagro and tommy robredo and theyve played their part in taking spain into the semifinals
4996459 our belief that we could win the tie certainly improved after the draw
4996460 i dont know what it is about the court maybe its something mystical its difficult to put your finger on it but every time i play here i seem to get some outside help
4996461 its going to be difficult to play in argentina because of the time difference we will need at least 9 days to try and adapt to the conditions

4996464 it would never occur to him to place the slightest credence in such a compendium of what must regard as insanities such a scene must have taken place thousands of times at the end of classical antiquity and we know that every time there was the same rejection the same shrugging because we have no record of any critical examination of the doctrines ideas and claims of the counterculture that expressed itself through the apocalypse this counterculture was too absurd to retain the attention of a reader of plato a short time a very short time elapsed the counterculture triumphed and plato was forgotten for a thousand years could it happen again

4996468 the fact is employers here have jobs and they need workers
4996469 when you are somali and living in the united states this is what you have to do sometimes
4996470 there has to be a better way to bridge somalis with the government

4996478 come friend i will talk to you personally again young man we shall soon grow old or perhaps we shall die before that time and we shall lie upon our bed the last bed upon which we shall ever sleep we shall wake from our last slumber to hear the doleful tidings that there is no hope the physician will feel our pulse and solemnly assure our relatives that it is all over and we shall lie in that still room where all is hushed except the ticking of the clock and the weeping of our wife and children and we must die o how solemn will it be that hour when we must struggle with that enemy death the death rattle is in our throat we can scarce articulate we try to speak the death glaze is on the eye death has put his fingers on those windows of the body and shut out the light for ever the hands well nigh refuse to lift themselves and there we are close on the borders of the grave ah that moment when the spirit sees its destiny that moment of all moments the most solemn when the soul looks through the bars of its cage upon the world to come no i can not tell you how the spirit feels if it be an ungodly spirit when it sees a fiery throne of judgment and hears the thunders of almighty wrath while there is but a moment between it and hell i can not picture to you what must be the fright which men will feel when they realize what they often heard of

4996482 i think mike coffman has that kind of party building mindset
4996483 i think i have a very definite future as a leader of the republican party

4996513 comparing the two formulae it can be seen that for a given compression ratio r the ideal otto cycle will be more efficient however a diesel engine will be more efficient overall since it will have the ability to operate at higher compression ratios if a petrol engine was to have the same compression ratio then knocking self ignition would occur and this would severely reduce the efficiency whereas in a diesel engine the self ignition is the desired behavior additionally both of these cycles are only idealizations and the actual behavior does not divide as clearly or sharply and the ideal otto cycle formula stated above does not include throttling losses which do not apply to diesel engines

4996811 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

4996814 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
4996815 our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
4996816 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra
4996817 and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
4996818 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
4996819 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
4996820 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
4996821 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
4996822 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
4996823 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process

4996832 i agree with what wil told his supporters last night
4996833 coffman appears to know no end to his political aspirations even if it means his own party will suffer
4996834 i think he will use his position in a good republican district to raise a bunch of money to help all of the candidates in the 6th congressional district and also the statewide candidates
4996835 i think mike coffman has that kind of party building mindset
4996836 i think i have a very definite future as a leader of the republican party

4996838 it is wonderful that the people in this remote part of africa will have access to basic but effective mobile internet access over an edge network here we can see how mobile communications can play a key role in helping improve the quality of life for people even in the remotest parts of the world
4996839 the millennium village project provides us with a unique ecosystem to demonstrate the benefits of voice and internet we believe the uptake of mobile services could go even quicker than anticipated in this environment as the need for even basic services is so much greater the project is one concrete example where we are actualizing our commitment to the mdgs while at the same time stimulating positive business impacts and opening new markets in remote parts of rural africa
4996840 mobile communication is perhaps the single most transformative technology for rural african villages to improve access to health care and education create new business opportunities and access to markets and ultimately to help eradicate extreme poverty we are excited by the tremendous opportunities which mobile phones make possible in every kind of community and economic activity ranging from pastoralists and farmers to traders health workers and teachers

4996843 mccain will have problems getting a high turnout among those voters unless he finds some way to identify with them some way to make them think that a hes not connected to bush and b his economic plan is superior to obamas
4996844 john mccain continues to hear the concerns of rural families thats why he has made every effort to engage these voters on his plans to create jobs and provide relief for working families
4996845 were getting a great response in rural communities that have been ignored by washington and left behind in the bush economy
4996846 im considering it but i dont want any of them

4996848 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority

4996850 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4996851 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
4996852 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4996853 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states

4996855 during the meeting with me the president spoke his mind that he is not considering the option to resign
4996856 slackened due to his insistence to do so only after going through the chargesheet against him
4996857 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4996858 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4996859 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
4996860 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep

4996863 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4996864 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4996865 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
4996866 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night

4996869 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
4996870 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
4996871 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me

4996880 en forma detenida lo establecido por ley 9140 mediante la que se ratifica el acta acuerdo suscripta entre las provincias de entre r os corrientes y misiones con el gobierno nacional que fuera ratificada a trav s de la ley 24 954 y que le permite a entre r os recibir los excedentes que genera la represa binacional de salto grande
4996881 esa misma ley provincial se crea la comisi n administradora para el fondo especial de salto grande cafesg que tiene dependencia directa del poder ejecutivo provincial y se le plantean claros objetivos
4996882 fue conocida durante a os como la obra inconclusa ya que se prioriz la producci n de energ a y no se tuvieron para nada en cuenta los efectos negativos que la construcci n y operaci n de la represa generaron en una inmensa regi n de entre r os
4996883 durante a os los fondos generados por una obra ubicada en nuestro territorio que modific las caracter sticas de un recurso natural del que tenemos el dominio originario como qued claramente contenido en la constituci n de 1994 eran utilizados discrecionalmente por el estado nacional
4996884 lograda la sanci n de la ley nacional que intenta reparar a nuestro territorio en un claro acto de federalismo se inici en 1998 un proceso paulatino de env o de fondos hoy d a si se han cumplido los alcances de la norma entre r os debe recibir el total del monto previsto originalmente que era el 67 5 de los fondos generados por la venta de energ a producida en la represa ubicada al norte de concordia eso s despu s de atender los costos de operaci n y mantenimiento del sistema
4996885 los excedentes nada tienen que ver con las regal as de salto grande y tampoco con los convenios que han suscripto algunas comunas con la comisi n t cnica mixta de salto grande por una serie de servicios que realizan en mbitos del complejo
4996886 los alcances del art culo 37 de la ley 24 065 en el que queda indicado que las empresas de generaci n de propiedad total del estado nacional tendr n derecho a recuperar solamente sus costos operativos y de mantenimiento totales que les permitan mantener la calidad continuidad y seguridad del servicio cuyo concepto y metodolog a de determinaci n ser n establecidos por la secretar a de energ a
4996887 los excedentes resultantes de la diferencia entre dicho valor y el precio de venta de la energ a generada en el caso de salto grande merced al convenio logrado despu s de mucha lucha es en parte para la provincia de entre r os
4996888 para dimensionar un poco esto tenemos que saber que no en vano el complejo hidroel ctrico de salto grande es considerado la joya del sistema de generaci n hidroel ctrica de nuestra naci n el mismo ha sido pagado y amortizado por eso la provincia de entre r os recibe cada trimestre fondos importantes

4996946 i knew i had it in me to get to the final and it has been my little secret target for the season and im absolutely chuffed that i did it
4996947 im quite pleased with that ive improved a lot on my time in athens
4996948 its a good chance and hard to come by and so you should go

4996953 i just want to enjoy this moment because im having an unbelievable year
4996954 its more than my best dreams so i want to enjoy the moment i know how difficult it is to win these things especially here winning for me is unbelievable
4996955 its very difficult to explain the way i feel right now it will take a few days before i realize im olympic champion

4996957 its a great goal i did it in athens and now i did it here
4996958 the olympics means really a lot to me so thats why im really happy im little bit sad about the match but all things considered im really happy
4996959 it worked once before why not try it on this
4996960 yes we had experiences back in athens but this has been a whole different story the whole way along
4996961 today is more satisfaction for having a good piece and winning a medal rather than atoning for past losses
4996962 its all part of who we are today as athletes yeah winning a medal today is a lot better than crashing into the south africans four years ago
4996963 we play golf we bowl were in japan in our camp and hes competitive at everything he does he gets all fired up daves a little more relaxed kind of happy go lucky he felt like he had a rebirth this year hes just been really relaxed and easy to work with open to coaching and criticism i think the two of them together kind of offset each other a little bit
4996964 i believed every step of the way that i would be here
4996965 i knew that with the right pair partner we could be on the medal podium
4996966 during assessment this morning we found the body of a woman burnt beyond recognition and that about 300 shacks were burnt down

4996969 i dont see the silver as a failure i won the silver
4996970 i cant stop crying im so thrilled and its an amazing experience
4996971 that was my first time going into a final in first place
4996972 you try to prepare for it mentally and stuff but theres nothing you can do so it was quite distracting
4996973 ive never had a match before where i can come off the line saying i had fun especially if i didnt do well
4996974 but this time i can say it was really fun to be part of the whole olympic experience to be representing america
4996975 i wish i would have represented them a little better a couple of minutes ago but other than that it was enjoyable i cant wait until 2012
4996976 dont let your losses surprise you alwasy ask this question
4996977 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them

4996981 with the help of allah they will make it but i think it will be difficult

4997010 i tried to put too much on it and ive just not hit it right but im delighted with the one in the second half
4997011 i think after the first one the pressure was on for me to hit the target and i think everyone is delighted that we got the result anyway
4997012 there was a few other tackles the lads got in last ditch but im definitely pleased with the defensive performance and i think the two centre halves did great for us and the boys are buzzing with it
4997013 hes got that quality we did free kicks and corners yesterday and his deliveries were fantastic and he got a rollicking for that first half effort which was a joke for his quality
4997014 hes got everything its up to charlie i keep saying to him everyday hes got all the quality in the world a wonderful left foot its a problem position all over the world and if youve got a left foot like hes got then if he can build up because hes got the height but some times hes a bit too easy for his own good its up to him if he wants to grab it

4997016 for the first time we present an experimental setup that allows measuring the subtle forces both physical and chemical that arise when single hairs slide past each other or are pressed against each other
4997017 the findings will help provide clearer strategies for optimizing hair care products
4997018 the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair care products affect hair to hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion
4997019 ive sat by in silence for a long time now about the way womens bodies are constantly scrutinized to set the record straight im not upset for me but for all of the girls out there that are struggling with their body image
4997020 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
4997021 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
4997022 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
4997023 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization
4997024 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
4997025 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
4997026 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
4997027 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
4997028 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
4997029 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games

4997059 i dont know how this happened or when this happened
4997060 i was able to be a part of three relays where we were able to put up a solid team effort
4997061 we came together as one unit for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well
4997062 espeically to be part of something as special as this
4997063 i just think the biggest thing is that nothing is impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination thats something i learned and something that helped me
4997064 hes done a wonderful job an incredible racer and hes a nice guy a good bloke
4997065 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i guess i kind of just want to see my mom
4997066 i felt like i was just running on one leg
4997067 if it had felt like i was really doing some serious damage then i would have stopped its horrible when you have to drop out especially when its the olympic games there are so many people have worked so hard to get me here
4997068 in some ways its almost quicker just to keep going because youre just left out there on your own if you stop
4997069 i wanted to finish it was really frustrating because i actually felt really comfortable and i could talk and tell gary lough her husband and coach what was wrong i just couldnt go any quicker
4997070 there couldnt have been better conditions when i started to struggle i got a whole lot of trucks around me and that was really annoying i was getting lots of fumes on top of everything else

4997080 the western australian liberal party stumbled badly on two issues this week which in the normal course of events should have been substantial pluses for them daylight saving and extended shopping hours

4997083 this park is about dictatorship and at the same time because it can be talked about described built this park is about democracy after all only democracy is able to give the opportunity to let us think freely about dictatorship
4997084 when cf stood up this school they worked with the iraqis to set up goals they wanted to achieve within a certain amount of time
4997085 some of the goals reached include the ability to run 4 training programs at the same time having fully renovated facilities with the ability to house 500 students and the availability of qualified iraqi instructors to lead the courses todays class represents the attainment of those goals in the bmt basic military training program
4997086 i feel proud to say im a lieutenant in the iraqi air force
4997087 sometimes we had problems with water or uniforms and our advisors helped us work it out
4997088 in the next bmt class the iraqi instructors will have even more responsibility as the usaf advisors transition from a full teaching function to equal parts advising and instructing
4997089 for the most part we have a uav on station for the majority of missions that involve the capture of high value targets or terrorists
4997090 our guys fly them out hand them off to the bcts in theatre and at that time the specific brigade tuav elements actually fly the missions
4997091 at the conclusion of a shadow mission the brigades route the aircraft back into our airspace and the uav operators here pick the aircraft back up and land them once they land we conduct maintenance and prep them for another mission
4997092 everything we do in terms of maintaining the aircraft is annotated by inputting info into our computer system we keep track of just about anything you can think from actual flight hours to required services and inspections
4997093 the uavs can provide at least 70 of the support you would get from an attack helicopter minus the armament
4997094 the operators can observe perform route recon and report immediately over voice what they see to the ground forces very similar to conventional aerial recon methods its very helpful
4997095 the shadow provides coverage for a lot of raids we do road scans for roadside bombs and have actually caught terrorists in the act of implanting these bombs in the road the uav mission is imperative to todays combat ops
4997096 when the infantry troops are going into a certain area to clear buildings well go in ahead of time and scan the area and well be able to report to them exact grids of potential enemies in the area
4997097 keeping soldiers safe on the battlefield is number one this is definitely a technology that will always be part of the fight
4997098 we welcome you to the first but not the last business development conference
4997099 the aim of the one day business development conference was to provide contract registration training to local iraqi contractors and teach them how to access business opportunities that are offered by jcci rcc basrah and grs also provided in the presentation were how to prepare responses to solicitations and how the proposals are evaluated
4997100 there is a clear difference in the quality of proposals from contractors that receive this type of training versus contractors that have not had training the contractors and the proposals also become competitive
4997101 i consider todays conference one of the most important events there were lots of mistakes made in our previous proposals that we didnt know about now we are able to avoid those mistakes and compete to win more projects to help build the future of our country
4997102 we got very useful and valuable guidance that will help us make successful proposals
4997103 we want to train and work with the u s army
4997104 we like our job here of running the traffic control point and providing security at the entrance of the patrol base
4997105 right now the iraqi soldiers have taken over the responsibility of the traffic control point but we are going to train them to be able to take over the entire patrol base go and do presence patrols and set up temporary traffic control points in our area
4997106 we are integrating with the isf to make us a better fighting force
4997107 they have stepped up to the plate and their partnership is why we are able to take over the mission that the georgians had to leave behind with no change in the security and safety of the iraqi people
4997108 i want to fight fiercely alongside the u s army
4997109 i get more training to be able to do the job
4997110 se eu pudesse viver novamente a minha vida na pr xima n o tentaria ser t o perfeito relaxaria mais correria mais riscos viajaria mais contemplaria mais entardeceres subiria mais montanhas nadaria mais rios iria a mais lugares onde nunca fui tomaria mais sorvete e menos lentilha teria mais problemas reais e menos problemas eu fui uma dessas pessoas que viveu sensata e produtivamente cada minuto da sua vida claro que tive momentos de alegria mas se pudesse voltar a viver trataria de ter somente bons porque se n o sabem disso feita a vida s de momentos eu era um desses que nunca ia a parte alguma sem um term metro uma bolsa de gua quente um guarda chuva e um p ra quedas se voltasse a viver viajaria mais leve se eu pudesse voltar a viver come aria a andar descal o no come o da primavera e continuaria assim at o fim do outono daria mais voltas na minha rua contemplaria mais amanheceres e brincaria com mais crian as se tivesse outra mas j viram tenho 85 anos e sei que estou morrendo

4997114 the proud curl of the upper lip expressed haughtiness and bitter contempt
4997115 let me take a moment to feel how this feels in my body perhaps i have contraction in my chest or solar plexus perhaps my breathing is shallow maybe i feel restless confused or paralyzed
4997116 if i notice that i am angry instead of compulsively acting out from the anger let me see how this anger actually feels in my body
4997117 let me feel the agitation the tightness the restlessness and my desire to strike out
4997118 ok i am reacting this way because i am disturbed instead of judging myself for being disturbed and for reacting i am going to observe this behavior in a nonjudgmental way
4997119 i am also going to notice how the disturbance affects how i think

4997144 rachael sage has an inimitable personal style a balance of flamboyance and femininity a performance as distinctive as it was entertaining
4997145 pop music isnt crafted as expertly as this anymore and sage is the stitch between the great rock and pop traditions of the past and what those traditions have wrought albeit almost invisibly in the hypermodern world of the present
4997146 the word leavetaking resonates with me and these songs on a couple of levels on one hand theres the call to wander and the choice one makes to search and to live in that motion and on the other hand the price of that choice and the feeling of loss that accompanies it and its a theme you hear in so many traditional songs some of them traveling songs or gospel songs or love songs theyve got that old longing in them that im really drawn to
4997147 i had met lex on tour a year earlier and after hearing him play and the music hes produced i knew i wanted to work with him
4997148 we mixed in los angeles at the studio of tv composer mike post a friend and supporter since eastmountainsouth kevin came out and we mixed 13 songs in seven days but at the end i felt that only nine fit this album so i decided this was just going to have to be a short record and not apologize for it

4997174 three months ago mervyn king the governor of the bank of england warned us that the nice decade was over by which he meant a sustained period of non inflationary consistent expansion three days ago he was prepared to consider the possibility of a recession
4997175 it was clear months before the governors speech that we were sailing into choppier financial waters and a tougher international climate it does not follow that the future has to be nasty in the economy as in life the future is what we make it
4997176 there is a resilience in the scottish economy to a downturn and there are indications that scotlands economy is performing significantly better than the uk as a whole albeit this is a relative improvement against an absolute decline

4997197 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4997198 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4997199 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4997200 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4997201 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4997202 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4997203 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4997204 the bike was moving round quite a bit but that one just caught me out no excuses no nothing it just caught me out

4997237 our top priority is to protect peoples health and in producing this inspection strategy we have taken a careful and thorough approach to ensure people are protected from contaminated land
4997238 we would very much like to hear peoples views on these proposals

4997267 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4997268 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4997269 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4997270 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4997271 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4997272 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4997273 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this

4997283 the decision has been made to play jamie mcdonald in goal and in the future steve banks will be the new goalkeeper coach he will be on the training staff
4997284 we must make a decision and now the owner is here and we have made a very clear decision and i think a very good decision for everyone
4997285 we have not become a great team because of that result
4997286 i am sure there will be a lot of things in the papers now saying we are the next best thing but wexford beat armagh and there are not too many teams that can day that
4997287 we settled quickly and got the goals at the right time
4997288 we came down here knowing we hadnt been playing great and dublin were the definite favourites we came down to do our best and thankfully it went well on the day
4997289 i tried to put too much on it and ive just not hit it right but im delighted with the one in the second half
4997290 i think after the first one the pressure was on for me to hit the target and i think everyone is delighted that we got the result anyway
4997291 there was a few other tackles the lads got in last ditch but im definitely pleased with the defensive performance and i think the two centre halves did great for us and the boys are buzzing with it
4997292 hes got that quality we did free kicks and corners yesterday and his deliveries were fantastic and he got a rollicking for that first half effort which was a joke for his quality

4997315 three months ago mervyn king the governor of the bank of england warned us that the nice decade was over by which he meant a sustained period of non inflationary consistent expansion three days ago he was prepared to consider the possibility of a recession
4997316 it was clear months before the governors speech that we were sailing into choppier financial waters and a tougher international climate it does not follow that the future has to be nasty in the economy as in life the future is what we make it
4997317 there is a resilience in the scottish economy to a downturn and there are indications that scotlands economy is performing significantly better than the uk as a whole albeit this is a relative improvement against an absolute decline
4997318 figures for scotlands labour market are stronger than the averages for the uk with higher employment and activity rates

4997359 the win is extremely important to start off at home
4997360 i think we were a little rusty at times in the first half but certainly the second we got a bit more cohesion so i was really pleased with how we finished off the game
4997361 once we went a goal down we had to look at trying to get in behind them their centre backs are quite slow so we wanted to inject a bit of pace but we just couldnt get the right ball to nikita

4997366 the time is coming when this order so dear to god will be brought into such disrepute by the bad example of evil friars that its members will be ashambed to appear in public but those who come to receive the habit of the order in those days will be guided solely by the workings of the holy spirit flesh and blood will not contaminate them and they will be truly blessed by god and although no noble works will be done by them because the love that enables the saints to labour so fervently will have grown cold they will be assailed by tremendous temptations but those who are found worthy in those days will be better friars than their predecessors
4997367 recently women have been entering the business at increasing levels at every level of the drug cartel
4997368 but most women in the trafficking business dont get caught so incarceration and indictment rates may not fully speak to the issue of who is doing it
4997369 there are risky huge implications for carrying drugs but there is a susceptibility among these women because they may not be as aware of these risks or the economic circumstances are so bad at home
4997370 so their life situation is used as an enticement to enter this line of work
4997371 another way they join the drug trade is by being coerced by a male actors husbands boyfriends
4997372 there have been more women women with children and whole families caught smuggling
4997373 drug traffickers think that they can use women to cross the drugs because they may look less suspicious but we are checking everyone
4997374 if you happen to see more instances of females caught with drug loads recently it may not necessarily be indicative of an overall trend because we have seen it before and we will likely see it again
4997375 now in the last three years the number of women searched has increased
4997376 but money is still a strong motivator for women to join the business

4997383 want to raise taxes now but they had a long time to make reductions
4997384 they kept saying the problem wasnt bad look where we are now
4997385 to say that we should have cut more sooner i guess we could have but we didnt know it was going to be this bad
4997386 there now needs to be a majority of commissioners to put their heads on the block and say layoffs are inevitable
4997387 maybe government employees should consider joining the real world where pensions automatic raises and benefits for life are not taken for granted
4997388 the project will play an integral role in attracting students from various regions and assist our institution in expanding its recruitment strategy and strategic plan initiatives
4997389 weve kept a lot of the really nice older features and weve modernized everything else
4997390 we had a wonderful footprint to work with and it would have been really different without that
4997391 its a very complex process and there are a lot of pieces that fit together but that was definitely important in making it a reality
4997392 i dont know how they could have done this type of a large scale project without it
4997393 it will have a positive impact on the neighborhood we had been losing businesses there
4997394 if you have 400 or 500 students i cant imagine little shops not opening up to cater to that kind of life

4997397 one of our major priorities is to recruit and retain physicians to meet the needs of the communities we serve
4997398 we are seeing a trend among new physician graduates preferring employment over establishing their own practice therefore we need multiple options for recruiting new physicians in the future
4997399 my preference is to be independent because i think i can best represent patients that way
4997400 since i havent been approached i dont know what the contract would involve

4997405 one of our keynote speakers barbara glanz said that she has spoken to hundreds of organizations on all seven continents but this was her first time at a conference that incorporated a community service event for attendees
4997406 it is our way of giving back to the host community while creating bonds among members and giving trainers an example of how they can take this type of effort back to their restaurants and hotels
4997407 to have been voted by my peers for this award is very humbling especially when you consider the experienced professional and exceptionally talented individuals at the head of the preeminent hotel management companies operating in this region today
4997408 at a time when more and more individual and institutional investors are recognising the long term attractions of hotel property assets throughout this part of the world the ability to help shape the environment in which hoteliers will be operating in five ten and twenty years from now is very exciting that my colleagues in the industry have seen fit to bestow me with this award is a remarkable honour
4997409 more than 270 projects are first class or luxury hotels
4997410 with over 60 luxury hotel projects this market segment grows by over 30 percent
4997411 revenue management means collecting figures data and facts as well as the analysis of the information so it is an extremely creative occupation
4997412 a new setting lasts normally from three to four months within this time however valuable know how gets lost at the same time the growth and competition ability are endangered
4997413 it is an ideal time to watch the actual situation of the hotel and if necessary bring new impulses to raise the sales
4997414 this way the long standing routine gets broken and new ways can be indicated
4997415 there is no perfect revenue management that can be implemented in each and every hotel
4997416 he has a new agreement with the sport director and with the owner
4997417 the decision has been made to play jamie mcdonald in goal and in the future steve banks will be the new goalkeeper coach he will be on the training staff
4997418 we must make a decision and now the owner is here and we have made a very clear decision and i think a very good decision for everyone
4997419 we have not become a great team because of that result
4997420 i am sure there will be a lot of things in the papers now saying we are the next best thing but wexford beat armagh and there are not too many teams that can day that
4997421 we settled quickly and got the goals at the right time

4997423 is the secret life of the american teenager the best worst show ever
4997424 i just want to enjoy this moment because im having an unbelievable year
4997425 its more than my best dreams so i want to enjoy the moment i know how difficult it is to win these things especially here winning for me is unbelievable
4997426 its very difficult to explain the way i feel right now it will take a few days before i realize im olympic champion
4997427 but this is for sure the biggest moment in my career in my life i will never forget this moment
4997428 its a great goal i did it in athens and now i did it here
4997429 the olympics means really a lot to me so thats why im really happy im little bit sad about the match but all things considered im really happy
4997430 we are delighted to have jon heading up the slh global sales team
4997431 his in depth hotel sales experience coupled with his genuine passion for the industry makes him a real asset to the brand
4997432 tah ima is being created to offer a very distinctive luxury resort experience complete with a wellness center and spa services designed to pamper and revitalize each guest

4997434 we have raised personalized guest services to a new level
4997435 i tried to put too much on it and ive just not hit it right but im delighted with the one in the second half
4997436 i think after the first one the pressure was on for me to hit the target and i think everyone is delighted that we got the result anyway

4997440 you must never try to make all the money thats in a deal let the other fellow make some money too because if you have a reputation for always making all the money you wont have many deals
4997441 im happy for crouch because now he can play more games its very important for him because its better
4997442 if a player plays only one game a month its not enough you lose the confidence this is very important for everything
4997443 i saw him in pre season against villarreal and he was fit enough
4997444 i never close the door to anyone i know him very well saw lots of his games last season and he is a very good player
4997445 you have to judge it on the size of the games you are playing and last season we were going for everything and every game was such a big game so the fact i managed to perform to my best was very satisfying
4997446 but you cant rest on that you want to improve and get better me personally i want to keep improving be successful and win more things
4997447 i think rooney can be both its possible to play like a second forward and score goals
4997448 he played very well in two games he didnt score but i was very happy with the performance

4997480 were making a lot of government leaders listen very closely
4997481 but we arent going to stop were getting bigger and bigger
4997482 im a fan because theyre a mystery and with all the science and technology we still havent figured it out
4997483 we read between the lines and start to learn how things are hidden then we can start to discover who we are
4997484 its great to be able to take all that ive learned and give it away to help parents manage their time and enjoy their children
4997485 i realized that it could be my last goodbye each morning and i really had to get it together first if i wanted my kids to get it together
4997486 i live my life on purpose instead of waiting for life to happen
4997487 from what ive learned most children do better with a color system
4997488 shes very experienced and she genuinely wants to pass on help so people can have less stress and enjoy their families

4997490 we want the sheriffs to hear from the horses mouth of what people are experiencing so they can take action thats what i want to come of tonights meeting
4997491 it will be a challenge to get this ordinance through and the first start is getting people to know to call the cops regarding any disturbance in los olivos to get this documented
4997492 the bottom line is getting more diversity into los olivos
4997493 theyre talking about a real problem but theres not really a clear definition of it yet
4997494 as a non tasting room business in los olivos i depend on tourism otherwise there is no way to survive on local traffic only what happens to my business if the wineries go
4997495 as a mother and a health practitioner i have concerns about sending mixed messages to my children as they walk from school seeing drunk people and we teach them about the consequences of alcohol
4997496 i was hit between the eyes at the eir environmental impact report meeting for the community plan update a few weeks ago because no one talked to me about their frustrations
4997497 the first line of defense is law enforcement and i can see you have already started on that secondly there needs to be a new county ordinance requiring conditional use permits
4997498 we still have to get the state parks funding for it to all come together
4997499 but we dont anticipate any problems our hope is to close escrow in december
4997500 that is why we placed a high priority on purchasing this property
4997501 we put together a whole menu of funding sources that ended up getting the job done
4997502 and i believe that of most people who admire that coast such facilities would be very intrusive
4997503 ive been working for three and a half years to do something to preserve that land
4997504 its an area thats been so much a part of our history
4997505 should provide i hope access for people so they can pull off the highway and see what the gaviota coast is really like hopefully for everybody from class a hikers to handicapped persons so they can enjoy the view
4997506 were kind of in a holding pattern until the oil companies who own it remove the tanks and do the soil testing
4997507 interestingly they parked in front of a gate that had three different signs on it saying no hunting and no firearms they admitted to seeing and understanding the signs
4997508 we are very serious about enforcing this ban on hunting in sedgwick reserve and people need to know that not only are we enforcing it during hunting season but we are there all year

4997575 feature a different experience than the game itself with a remade tie fighter construction facility
4997576 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
4997577 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
4997578 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
4997579 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
4997580 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
4997581 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
4997582 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
4997583 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
4997584 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable

4997600 he took multiple phone calls from domenici concerning iglesias urging that he be replaced and has admitted that president george w bush spoke with him about the problems with iglesias
4997601 gonzales has even admitted that one of the reasons that iglesias was fired was because sen domenici had lost confidence in iglesias
4997602 while these allegations are troubling under any analysis a thorough and independent investigation is necessary to determine whether criminal laws have been violated
4997603 under the broad language of the federal statute regarding obstruction of justice it would be hard to imagine that corruptly influence would not extend to firing of the united states attorney in the middle of a public corruption case because he lost confidence of a senator who sought to manipulate the indictments for crass political advantage
4997604 mcnulty also may have sought to conceal an important phone call from sen domenici regarding u s attorney iglesias instructing then justice department liaison to the white house monica goodling to delete reference to that call from his senate testimony
4997605 lam alerted the justice department that fbi agents would at her direction search foggos home in connection with the duke cunningham case and the following day former gonzales chief of staff kyle sampson e mailed the white house from the attorney generals office that we have a real problem with carol lam and urged that she be dismissed at the conclusion of her term
4997606 given the wide publicity of the cunningham political corruption case it is reasonable to conclude that gonzales mcnulty sampson and other senior justice department officials were aware of the underlying judicial proceeding being handled by carol lam

4997636 perhaps more embarrassing to prudently financial new labour are the ranks of tramps and malingerers who have escaped into ashworth to avoid working for a living demanding and receiving full board and full benefits of 100 per week pocket money for life we prison transfers receive only 25 being regarded as patients only for restrictions

4997897 it is our clear position and this position is strengthened after the russian violations that it was a big mistake made by allies that georgia and ukraine did not get the membership action plan in bucharest

4997915 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw
4997916 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
4997917 russian georgian and south ossetian forces all have an obligation under international humanitarian law to protect civilians from attack
4997918 the latest information on civilian casualties in gori tskhinvali and surrounding areas calls into question whether the forces are respecting that obligation
4997919 victims of the attack described to human rights watch how they saw numerous small explosions within seconds before they fell to the ground
4997920 some of them had been hit by rockets most likely fired from grad launchers weapons that should not be used in areas populated by civilians as they cannot be directed at only military targets and are therefore inherently indiscriminate
4997921 we burned these houses we want to make sure that they the georgians cant come back because if they do come back this will be a georgian enclave again and this should not happen
4997922 two of them didnt do anything to us so we just let them go we couldnt take them anywhere as i had to take care of my own men first the third one seemed to be high on something a normal person would have surrendered and this one was shooting at us instead we questioned him and then executed him
4997923 people are continuing to arrive in north ossetia by the busload and many civilians are wounded

4997925 stewart haas racing has had and will continue to have discussions with numerous people regarding leadership positions within the team including crew chiefs for the nos 4 and 14 teams at this point no decisions have been made in regard to filling those positions
4997926 were working to not get just one crew chief were working to get a pair of crew chiefs that are going to work well together
4997927 it helps us work together better as drivers and keeps the organization just that much more intact makin great sense already smoke

4997953 we saw the lanterns coming out of a garden off bradfield road at about half six there was a group of three lads letting them off and three more riding on bikes to see how far they were going they were laughing at all the people staring
4997954 there are usually between 80 and 90 sightings a year and the vast majority of them are these lanterns or balloons they only cost around 3 and can be set off within minutes of being bought
4997955 its very hard to judge how big something is in the sky because there is nothing to compare things with
4997956 as for the disappearing the lantern more than likely just went behind low cloud cover rather than vanish into thin air

4997991 ive been thinking about it ever since kyle hamilton told reporters sunday about the disappointing finish in 2004
4997992 i never thought id get the opportunity to be a favourite in an olympics again
4997993 just to come in as a favourite is an amazing experience to do it twice is just amazing and to win i cant say anymore
4997994 i knew that we had won it there was nobody coming back at that point coxswain brian price told reporters sunday in beijing as he talked about raising his arms near the finish line
4997995 we started everything we could in the first 500 to get ourselves into the race and essentially through the middle its a dogfight everybody wants a piece of it said ian brambell of the mens four crew
4997996 we knew that we had a really solid 500 and it was just a matter of not waiting for it but going everyone together we closed the eyes and went for it
4997997 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and ian said go for it we committed everything we had and went said parsons
4997998 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
4997999 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
4998000 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
4998001 after our first two races we kind of had a tendency of sort of getting caught in the last 500 so we made it our mission to really execute that last 500 and lay it all down on the line and i think we did that
4998002 it was a hard race i think the first half took a lot out of me for the second half i just couldnt be happier
4998003 hopefully there are more to come with canoeing starting and trampoline obviously were hoping there is a good momentum for more medals
4998004 i never thought id get the opportunity to be a favourite in an olympics again
4998005 just to come in as a favourite is an amazing experience to do it twice is just amazing and to win i cant say anymore
4998006 i knew that we had won it there was nobody coming back at that point
4998007 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
4998008 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and iain said go for it we committed everything we had and went
4998009 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
4998010 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
4998011 it was a hard race i think the first half took a lot out of me for the second half i just couldnt be happier
4998012 it was really hard to compete on the last day
4998013 the team has been so supportive we really showed what we can do i think were really ecstatic to be canadians right now
4998014 i thought if i could get a quick enough shot it did not have to be hard i just wanted to get it on net and i managed to hit the goalies glove and it trickled in
4998015 you can get bad tempered and withdrawn obviously that can be a challenge within a crew and for the girlfriends
4998016 the last 200m were just a case of keep going the last 10 years have come down to six minutes of hell but its all worth it
4998017 but we know its just a bunch of guys taking a guess
4998018 nice for the media but its the postseason standings that matter
4998019 we hope to improve on where we were last year
4998020 last year we played with a lot of young guys and this year youre going to see some names show up who are going to be freshmen
4998021 to get some younger guys mixed in with some of the older guys is a healthy thing and were excited about it
4998022 were going to fly to the ball and make things happen
4998023 i guarantee we were the worst 7 3 team in the country in terms of turnovers
4998024 we finally found an identity offensively toward the end of the year
4998025 i think our team is ready to take another step and are up to the challenge of competing for the conference championship
4998026 if we cant stay healthy its going to be a long season

4998028 jitender had not even made it to the semi finals in the state level competition but we felt he had the talent to make it big
4998029 he had fire in him and we could see that he wanted to excel
4998030 he had the right physique to be a good boxer he had good height and the right mentality too the moment we saw him we knew we had discovered a top performer
4998031 we try to pick them at an early stage give them proper training before unleashing them in the national sub junior junior and senior levels after that its up to the national federation said thakran whos also the co ordinator of indian amateur boxing federation iabf
4998032 just prior to these games we sent the qualified boxers to taiwan for the presidents cup where all the top boxers of the world were present
4998033 then a training cum competition programme in germany prepared them properly for the olympics in between they had their regular camps at patiala
4998034 we have lot of faith on our boxers they are no less than any other in the world their wins are not at all surprising daggar said
4998035 they have beaten big names in the past and i am sure they will continue to do so in the future
4998036 team sports like cricket should not be included in the olympics olympics is a personal game where sportsman tries to excel within himself
4998037 it would be unfair to include cricket in the olympics as the players of other sports especially of individual events wait for the single day to happen and show their talents
4998038 hampers other sports but it is the governments who should take corrective measures to ensure that individual sports also get their due
4998039 they have to learn the offense zach and joe know what were trying to accomplish and how and why but it is wide open the difference will be i would think how quickly the two young guys grab the idea and what strides joe and zach made during the summer
4998040 as much as id like to be the starting quarterback its pushing me
4998041 here was a kid that was how are we going to win to we won the ivy league championship
4998042 for a minute you didnt think he was able to turn it around and get the job done would i love it if that was zach or joe absolutely
4998043 if i wouldve come in as a freshman with them i probably wouldnt have much of a chance but luckily i was here a little longer
4998044 whether they take this over now or after us thats going to be a heck of a quarterback battle right there between those two guys
4998045 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4998046 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4998047 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4998048 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today

4998248 the eu must work towards changing its attitudes towards entrepreneurship and create a positive culture which encourages people to take risks
4998249 we need to promote creative thinking in kids minds teach them ability to learn sense of initiative and capacity to take responsibility to turn ideas into action
4998250 you cant teach a person how to become an entrepreneur

4998543 i never worked as a thief also i never lived without taking cognizance of reality i came up from the ground level because i had no tolerance when every development in the life round me was bad for my people
4998544 when i accepted my visit to london i used a false passport and they jailed me for it but they gave me maximum security
4998545 now that im back in sri lanka people will accept me and my politics in the future i want to see change that is now happening in the east when i broke away from the ltte many people thought they could kill me within a short period they thought it was the same internal crisis like in the past but not at all i openly challenged prabhakaran in what was a major incident within the ltte now people can understand that the ltte way is wrong they will never win their mythical dream
4998546 their voices come like a cry from hell now i would like to call it the echo from hell
4998547 political cohabitation with the south is the biggest enemy of our struggle

4998550 it is the artist not the critic who gives society something of lasting value
4998551 unlike drm providers that focus on protecting the product mediadefender tries to protect the distribution channel and only for a limited time
4998552 but those things which were profit to me i gave up for christ

4998580 i would like to share with you an occurrence that happened on december 10 1999 in the a m my 8 year old was at school and my husband was at work i had my 6 month old son in his swing in front of the television watching sesame street what caught my attention was that the television made the shhhh sound i turned to look and the screen was snowy as expected with that noise its what happened next the television completely cut off my child was asleep no sooner did i think oh the cable must have cut off did i hear a voice it said the lord is coming very very soon i was dumbfounded and then the tv came back to normal and sesame street continued
4998581 it is over three weeks since we learned that the portuguese authorities had closed the investigation to find madeleine lifted our arguido status and ended judicial secrecy
4998582 it will be clear to everyone now that there is absolutely no evidence that suggests madeleine has been seriously harmed
4998583 knowing this we strongly believe that madeleine is out there and can be found
4998584 of course whoever is responsible for madeleines abduction must and can be found to prevent them from putting another child and family through the misery we have suffered
4998585 we have always believed that this heinous crime could be solved with the help of the public
4998586 our investigators continue to explore credible leads and will continue to do so as long as madeleine is missing
4998587 now that the authorities are no longer looking for madeleine we implore everyone who has provided information to the enquiry to contact us
4998588 i was accused of assaulting a child in the street but this case should never have been brought to court
4998589 i cant believe this happened to us and we should not have to live like this for the rest of our lives we were terrified when the windows came in
4998590 it could be something to do with my court case or something to do with eamonn but i just dont know
4998591 this intimidation has been going on for about 13 years now and when we think it has stopped for a few months something like this happens
4998592 some of the kids in the street have been making our lives a misery but im not going to be bullied by them they are urinating and drinking but nothings ever done about it
4998593 we also believe that there are people who want us out of our home because they dont want to see two pensioners living in a four bedroom house but its our right to live wherever we choose
4998594 the only reason we cant escape this nightmare is because we dont have the resources and because we spent a lot of money on this property
4998595 we love the house but these people are making are lives a misery and we just want to be left alone
4998596 we work tirelessly in the downpatrick area to stamp out this type of activity and i would urge councillors in killyleagh to use their influence to help bring these types of attacks to an end
4998597 this couple have been subjected to a campaign of intimidation for a number of years and it must end now
4998598 people connected with the show were very keen to get nadine
4998599 then word got out they were also interested in jesse and that would be a real no go for her shes got jesse out of her system and in any case nadine has far too many commitments to be spending six or seven weeks in the jungle
4998600 you can stand by for some pretty big news in the not to distant future
4998601 its illuminating to find out what the big boys are earning at a time when ordinary staff are facing job cuts to plug a budget shortfall
4998602 were feeling the squeeze big time but the current round of redundancies havent affected those at the top
4998603 any one of us can have a terrible day of trauma but since that day every day for us is august 15
4998604 you have your memories and you think of what should have been and what actually is you have to accept what happened and come to terms with it
4998605 it does hurt me to go on flights and see an air hostess walking down the aisle lorraine could have been on a flight we were travelling on
4998606 its other things too having a family passing her driving test christmas presents all these issues its ongoing my eldest daughter denise got married and lorraine wasnt here to be her bridesmaid
4998607 we have a granddaughter now and lorraines not here to greet her we have all these things to deal with
4998608 my wife ann would stand in the corner not speaking and i couldnt stop crying i had ulcers in my eyes
4998609 i drove round country roads at high speed but i realised the hurt it would have caused my family youre broken and you want to get away from the pain your head is in a state of turmoil and shock
4998610 you still get days of desperation and you feel loneliness which does drag you down
4998611 i can still see her laid out with the water running from her clothes and her face full of shrapnel the shock of that when your eyes have seen something like that the picture never goes away
4998612 it brings tears to my eyes to talk about this situation but i feel the world has to know what terrorism can do to people
4998613 the people in power cant get the people who did this and thats hurtful the only thing i want and my family wants is justice
4998614 the fact that i was not asked for my opinion has caused me a great deal of pain and hurt
4998615 i dont pass my wifes shop and my family dont pass it this is not closure its confrontation
4998616 its 15 feet away from the shop and i dont know why this wasnt thought out thats the spot where people fell and died and were hurt and i include those people who were traumatised
4998617 i still dont have a monument on her grave i already have her monuments they are our two children our grandchildren and our great grandchildren
4998618 my wife was a very serene woman she was a very good wife and mother and the sad thing is she would have made a great grandmother
4998619 ive broken my health but thats of no importance as you get older its libby that im worried about
4998620 you cant get closure if she had died by gods hands that would have been different but someone took her right to life
4998621 im sure that in the future we will get justice of some sort im very very determined
4998622 ive got the x factor weve got the x factor glasgows got the x factor scotlands got the x factor wee hamish over there has the x factor
4998623 we want to speak to children and get the message across to them that if they get into trouble when they are young it will affect the rest of their lives
4998624 the psni officers are guiding us on how best to go about setting up the scheme and have expressed an interest in getting involved by talking to the kids about the dangers of drugs
4998625 myself and paul would hope to talk about crime and the consequences sharing our experiences with the school kids
4998626 all i was interested in was drinking and fighting and i had this great big chip on my shoulder
4998627 i was rioting with the police and throwing petrol bombs at them everyone in our area was doing it at the time
4998628 my life was never normal until i was 36 and gave my life to jesus
4998629 since then i have got my driving licence bought my first car and my first house and even been on holiday for the first time
4998630 up until then i never cared about anybody else and i say this regretfully not boastfully
4998631 i have three children in belfast who dont want anything to do with me and i cant blame them as i was never there when they needed me
4998632 i am not proud of my past and i cant change it but i can change my future and only with the help of christ who sacrificed everything on the cross
4998633 i had been carrying out robberies for the sake of it from i was in my early teens when i left home and lived in that derelict house i had to steal to get what i needed
4998634 i started carrying out attacks for the paramilitaries rioting and so on and in return i got to stay in their houses for periods of time
4998635 i never actually joined any organisation but was always on the fringes
4998636 i was 19 and it really hit home that jesus loved me and died for me and wanted to give me a real life a full life
4998637 i decided something would have to be done and i got some boys together to carry out a robbery in ballymoney
4998638 i was going to use the money to buy a weapon to shoot jonathans killer it was my intention to get involved in the feud to get my revenge
4998639 if i hadnt been caught and sent to prison i am sure i would have done murder
4998640 in maghaberry i wanted to be a tough guy and a real menace and spent most of my time in the punishment unit
4998641 i had a lot of anger in me and although i knew my life was in a mess i thought i was in control
4998642 we want to help give these people a second chance
4998643 we want them to know there is somebody there who cares about their families and helping them get back to normality
4998644 we will be setting up a drop in centre in lurgan and on the shore road in belfast to offer a cup of tea and to help them fill in forms
4998645 and as many of them have literacy problems we are looking at the possibility of having a teacher coming in to do adult education i have been in their shoes and i have been where they are who better to talk to prisoners than ex prisoners
4998646 as well as hopefully giving practical help for us one of the most important parts of what we are doing and what we hope to do with the prisoners and school children is to help people to see that jesus is the answer to all our problems and that prayer changes things
4998647 we are aware of the proposals being considered and have offered only advice with no other direct involvement
4998648 we would consider getting involved with the scheme and welcome anything aimed at reducing crime and making northern ireland a safer place to live
4998649 yes it is very frustrating for me and the players and im sure the fans too
4998650 some of the players felt that it shouldnt have gone ahead but to be fair the referee wanted to give it every chance
4998651 but you could see from very early on that a couple of tackles were going in that werent malicious but because of the conditions it was very dangerous and someone could have got hurt
4998652 i can completely understand the decision and now we have to try and get focused on next weeks game
4998653 it is going to be very difficult to try and fit it in we are only a couple of weeks into the new season and already we are looking at fixture congestion
4998654 we have a county antrim shield game on tuesday night to deal with and then very soon the setanta cup games are coming up its a lot to deal with so early but i suppose everyone is in the same boat
4998655 it was a game that we were all looking forward to because it would give us a real look at how far we have come on and what we have to do
4998656 i thought we played well and i could see that the boys were really up for it and at least thats something i can take out of it
4998657 well just have to get on with it it wasnt ideal but the referee made the right decision to stop it because there was a lot of water lying on the pitch and if there is any danger that someone could get hurt then you have to call it off
4998658 he was huge and it took the police and the firefighters ages to get him out
4998659 some of the boys knew him and his background but they still had to do a professional job
4998660 its no coincidence that he was due to appear in court on the monday and because he was so worried he took some pills to ease his pain
4998661 some people believe it may have been an attempt by him to be sent to hospital but because of the state of his health he ended up killing himself
4998662 the house was in a terrible state and there were porn magazines and cats everywhere hes certainly one of the biggest people theyve managed to get out of a house
4998663 people are convinced there are more victims out there and were just relieved he wont be able to attack any more innocent children
4998664 the funeral of mr corry was conducted in saul church by a visiting rector mr corrys family met briefly with the rector immediately prior to the funeral and provided details of his work with the red cross and the udr the rector was not aware of the charges facing mr corry or of his previous convictions
4998665 we have done everything by the book and andrew was at the game and the chairman jim kerr and i will sit down with him and his agent
4998666 we have been after andrew for a long time and my assistant bryan mclaughlin has done a lot of hard work to get us to this situation
4998667 after hamilton told us they wanted to keep the player after we made an offer some time ago we were approached by the hamilton but i know other clubs are interested and im sure his agent will be looking to get him the best deal possible
4998668 but the reality of the situation is that we have been pursuing andrew we would very much like him here and we have told him that
4998669 we want him here as much as we wanted kevin kelbie here but ultimately it will be up to him
4998670 but even if we do sign andrew our search continues
4998671 we need one more forward player if not two and we will keep looking
4998672 last week has gone now and i took the decision because i didnt see there being a dangers to the players and the ball was rolling
4998673 but as the game went on i was in constant contact with my assistants and after half an hour it was becoming a farce and there was a danger to the players so i stopped it immediately
4998674 it didnt matter that linfield were 1 0 up at the time as far as i was concerned the game would have been a farce and the players safety was the most important thing
4998675 der start ist mir wirklich gut gelungen nach dem dritten platz im warm up war ich guter dinge und wollte alles geben

4998702 der inhalt dieser akte best tigt auch die behauptung der beklagten dass man bei der antragstellerin und ihren anw lten im massengesch ft den berblick verloren hat so hei t es n mlich in dieser sache in der klageerwiderung der rechtsanw lte vom 22 m rz 2007 dass man mit gleicher post hauptsacheklage vor dem landgericht berlin erhoben habe die beigef gte abschrift der unterlassungsklage ist freilich adressiert an das landgericht hamburg

4998708 generally speaking though americans have an inability to relax into sheer pleasure ours is an entertainment seeking nation but not necessarily a pleasure seeking one americans spend billions to keep themselves amused with everything from p0rn to theme parks to wars but thats not exactly the same thing as quiet enjoyment
4998709 for me though a major obstacle in my pursuit of pleasure was my ingrained sense of puritan guilt this is very american too the insecurity about whether we have earned our happiness
4998710 can i allow myself to relax for a few hours
4998711 analyze the direct and indirect costs of malaria in the economic development and growth of chad
4998712 im interested in telling narratives and advocating peoples existent feelings
4998713 this mission is an amazing opportunity to have a huge impact on this hard locked heart locked crisis ive never been to gaza myself but i know that gaza is the forgotten little brother of the middle east or at least of the israeli palestinian crisis everything about this crisis is clearer in gaza the israeli occupation strategy is much clearer in gaza because its not specifically about taking more land its mostly about completely destroying a people
4998714 americans are terribly ignorant of the human effects of what they support i think this boat is one of the most effective means of raising consciousness particularly american consciousness about the problems caused by american foreign policy americans have to know the consequences of these policies im sixty four years old my children are grown and my affairs are in order i think about rachel corrie and about what israel may do to us i know its risky but i take a risk when i ride a motorcycle and i think that if were really going to change things then somebody has to begin putting something on the line for that change to happen
4998715 for years and years seeing place in the world that were being totally destroyed and people that were being totally destroyed by other people and governments i thought theres nothing that i could do
4998716 no one is paying attention to whats happening in gaza no one is listening to palestinians they are slowly being strangulated by israel and no one is even listening i cant sit outside of this and just let it happen we as human beings have an obligation to stand up and i cant be passive about it you cant stand up in london and just say that you dont agree we need to find ways to connect people in the middle east particularly young people to people and groups in wealthier countries together we can inspire each other and together we can be much more than we are alone
4998717 were local we live here and work here and we support this country

4998721 whats the fear that students are going to get indoctrinated
4998722 career days are to provide our students with steps they can take after graduation whether that be brown university bridgewater state college new england tractor trailer school or the army or navy
4998723 this group wants to have a debate thats not what these career days are for
4998724 if we open it up to them others seeing it as a forum for discussion will want to set up tables too
4998725 but most of the horror stories they told were from far off in other parts of the country not in bridgewater
4998726 because im not hearing complaints from people here in town im not sure we need to do anything about this
4998727 just as we would have if the garden club or any other group wanted to come in

4998733 council members are acutely aware of the costs of this project we are also acutely aware of the importance of securing a reliable water supply as our wells are depleted and meeting state requirements to reduce environmental impacts from our wastewater discharges
4998734 the nwri panel recommended that davis pursue a balanced water portfolio combining surface water ground water conservation and reuse strategies the unanimous findings of the panel are that no other alternative exists that would support these objectives as effectively economically or environmentally as the proposed surface water project
4998735 all five council members have stated that surface water will be needed at some time the panel report and presentation on july 29 concluded that delay in pursuing this project would result in significant cost increases loss of winter water loss of water rights and other serious negative consequences
4998736 the panel concluded that the most serious consequence from postponing the project is the probability of losing the pending appropriative right to withdraw up to 46 100 acre feet of water per year from the sacramento river
4998737 the panel concluded that postponement of the project to a later date would likely result in the loss of upstream water currently available for purchase to supplement the amount of water needed during the summer months

4998810 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
4998811 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end

4998823 kenapa mesti takut kita bersaing secara sehatlah toh masyarakat banten sudah pintar memilih pemimpin yang baik mereka tidak bisa dibodohi lagi
4998824 saya khawatir bila bukan saya gubernurnya program yang telah ada akan hilang padahal sangat bermafaat untuk kemajuan daerah ini
4998825 alhamdulillah pada hari ini telah ditetapkan gubernur dan wakil gubernur terpilih periode 2007 2012 mudah mudahan dapat lancar sampai tanggal 11 januari mendatang dilakukan pelantikan
4998826 siapa yang akan akan diusung pada pemilihan kepala daerah provinsi banten nanti sepenuhnya kewenangan pusat
4998827 jadi sudah 20 tahun saya bergelut di dunia enteprenuer dan saya berkeinginan bisa berbuat yang terbaik untuk tanah kelahiran saya banten oleh karena itu pemilihan 2001 saya manfaatkan sekali
4998828 saya tk sampat sd di banten baru smp saya di bandung di bandung saya mandiri saya usaha sendiri saya hanya minta masukan pada orang tua tetapi saya lakukan sendiri semuanya
4998829 usaha kecil kecilan seperti pengadaan atk alat tulis kantor suplai beras dan sebagainya yang sifatnya pengadaan dan lama lama kontruksi dan lain lain
4998830 jadi ini keputusannya terjun ke politik dan birokrasi murni keinginan saya saya berpikir wilayah mana yang bisa saya masuki untuk memberikan terbaik untuk banten setelah jadi propinsi yang sifatnya subjek bukan objek dari situ saya sampaikan ke suami dan keluarga awalnya mereka sepintas menanggapi dingin dingin saja karena saat itu mereka tahu saya ini sedang betul betul menikmati kesuksesan saya di dunia usaha
4998831 tetapi tidak semua ulama atau pemimpin pesantren berpandangan demikian ada pemimpin pesantren yang sangat tradisional bahkan mesjidnya diharamkan menggunakan pengeras suara justru tidak menyetujui pandangan yang menolak kepemimpinan perempuan pemimpin pesantren ini juga mengutip salah satu ayat al quran yang menyatakan bahwa islam tidak menolak kepemimpinan perempuan
4998832 derajat seseorang tidak ditentukan jenis kelamin laki laki atau perempuan tetapi amal ibadahnya
4998833 tapi saya tidak pernah memikirkan sampai situ walaupun saya tahu ada orang yang under estimate pada kemampuan saya pada akhirnya mereka akan menilai kinerja yang telah saya lakukan itu prinsip saya saya tidak mau pusing dengan apa kata orang tetapi bukan berarti saya tidak peduli kalaupun ada kritik saya anggap sebagai masukan dan introspeksi buat saya tetapi terhadap yang mencibir saya anggap sebagai cambuk saja bukan sebagai pikiran
4998834 isinya tentang alokasi anggaran 20 persen dari setiap program satuan kerja perangkat daerah dinas biro badan harus dialokasikan untuk yang terkait dengan sentuhan pada hal hal yang dibutuhkan perempuan tidak hanya di lingkup perempitah provinsi tapi juga dilakukan pemerintah kabupaten kota
4998835 mereka betul betul melakukan pembinaan sampai ke tingkat terendah di desa desa pembinaan dilakukan oleh ibu ibu istri pejabat termasuk bergabung dengan bkow badan koordinasi organisasi wanita sekaragn ada 50 organisasi perempuan di banten yang masuk bkow tujuang membina kaum perempuan itu program saya waktu jadi wakil gubernur dan akan terus di kembangkan setelah saya jadi gubernur
4998836 sejak oktober 2005 saya diangkat jadi pelaksana tugas gubernur karena pak gubernur sedang berhalangan disitulah saya betul betul harus menjadi seorang pemimpin yang selain melaksanakan tugas dan fungsi saya sebagai wakil tetapi saya pun harus bisa menggantikan tugas dan fungsi pak gubernur
4998837 saya kaget saya sempat merenung karena saya memang tidak berharap saya berharap bisa menyelesaikan sampai 5 tahun bersama pak gubernur
4998838 itu sudah jadi takdir saya saya menjalankan tugas dan fungsi saya sebagai kepala daerah yah double setelah saya renung sesaat saya harus tegar dan disitulah saya mempersiapkan diri untuk selalu sehat harus bekerja keras saya harus mempelajari semua program yang sudah ada alhamdulillah semua berjalan dengan baik akhir tahun ini sudah selesai semua tugas dan kewajiban kita
4998839 kelihatannya mereka memang tidak protes tapi terkadang mereka ingin ketemu makan bareng dan lebih sering jalan sama sama sebenarnya selama ini selalu saya sempatkan tapi insyaallah tahun depan akan saya sempatkan dan saya beri waktu lebih lama
4998840 tapi kalau saya sampaikan bunda ada kerjaan dulu yang tidak bisa ditinggalkan
4998841 tahun depan saya akan fokuskan perhatian ke keluarga bagaimanapun saya ingin mereka tumbuh sebagai anak dengan kemampuan pendidikan yang baik mendapatkan ilmu yang bermanfaat yang bagaimanapun juga tidak lepas dari pantauan ibu

4998851 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
4998852 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy with their lot
4998853 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits

4998863 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
4998864 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
4998865 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
4998866 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration

4998869 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
4998870 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
4998871 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
4998872 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
4998873 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
4998874 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
4998875 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
4998876 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
4998877 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
4998878 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
4998879 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
4998880 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
4998881 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
4998882 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
4998883 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
4998884 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
4998885 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
4998886 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
4998887 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered

4998902 cambodia definitely had one of the most advanced music scenes in asia at the time
4998903 it is amazing that a lot of it survived at all
4998904 the khmer rouge destroyed everything related to the music scene they could get their hands on including trashing all the recording studios and destroying all the musical recordings they could find
4998905 when i first heard this music i did not think much of it
4998906 the more i listened the more i realised just how different and edgy this music was
4998907 thailand vietnam and laos did not have this scene it was unique to cambodia
4998908 this exposed cambodian musicians to jimi hendrix phil spector the doors
4998909 meanwhile from europe we got latin styles such as cha cha rumba and flamenco
4998910 in the khmer community in long beach california you cannot go down the street without hearing this music
4998911 for them it was about memories of cambodia in the good times
4998912 i remember seeing the tapes of artists like sisamouth and sereysothea for sale in the phnom penh in the nineties
4998913 i did not really pay any attention to the music until i bought a computer to learn design i stumbled on music editing software and started messing around with sampling khmer music
4998914 soon i was started going out and combing the markets listening to every song i could find from this period and i started to mix and sample them
4998915 the first reaction i had from people was shock they thought it was blasphemy and did not understand why i wanted to do it
4998916 i started remixing old music for fun but now it has become a real mission trying to remind people now just how creative people were back then
4998917 in the next five years we are going to see a real explosion of the arts in cambodia particularly in music
4998918 i hope the pre war songs will be part of that
4998919 the day we found out we came home and started doing some research on the internet we had never heard of such a disease and the internet just listed three types of sma
4998920 sma zero is when a baby has the disease from birth at first lavon could move his fingers hands and legs but slowly this stopped from the time he was born he couldnt breathe without the ventilator he also had to have a drip and a tube placed through his nose that went to his stomach
4998921 he was a very alert child he would smile when we spoke to him and would frown or cry if something was hurting but his eyes told you his story we had a short time with him but we formed a close bond the nurses were also very fond of him they really went the extra mile for lavon
4998922 regarding testing for sma it wont be detected in women who are pregnant for the first time unless theres a family history of sma
4998923 antenatal testing can be done if the couple suspect their unborn child could have sma
4998924 a childs blood can also be tested if his or her parents think he or she might have it
4998925 we had to plan a funeral for him before he died that was the hardest part
4998926 theres no doubt that the springboks will very disappointed with themselves this sunday morning
4998927 they will be reminded throughout this week it will be in the news about this defeat
4998928 but i have no doubt they will be up for it next week in durban
4998929 after durban it will be johannesburg and thats been a happy hunting ground for them
4998930 you must not forget that australia also have great pressure of their own
4998931 they have not won at home for some time so they also want to get that monkey off their back
4998932 i have no doubt that the boks will be up and ready next week when they come up against australia
4998933 obviously it was bad enough for him to come off with injuries like that it usually takes about 48 hours to settle or get worse well just have to manage it starting with ice on it all the way home
4998934 if we can keep the swelling down then we could get him back sooner
4998935 richard richie mccaw has a couple of sore ribs and well only know how bad it is when we get home like many of the other players who picked up bruises he appears to be better today sunday than yesterday saturday
4998936 its been a roller coaster ride and there was never a dull moment
4998937 you have to put your quality of life first and as i am an islander durbans weather suited me the best
4998938 beer is a live organism and all the ingredients barley hops maize and water are natural it takes time to ferment and you cant rush it and any changes in the climate will affect your crop
4998939 you need to take these variables and manipulate the process in a certain way so the beer comes out exactly the same because the guy sitting in a pub will want his beer to taste the same
4998940 it is a highlight in the life of a brew master to win a grand champion worldwide award and to do it three times was exciting and emotional
4998941 taking the art and craft of brewing to the consumers and customers
4998942 i train people in the trade to ensure maintenance of quality standards
4998943 i also go to the pubs to try to get people to look after our beers educate those who handle our beer to make sure that they do so the right way that their stock rotation is right and that the beer is poured properly the presentation of the beer is important when you pour it the glass must be clean and every brand must have its own glass it needs to have the right amount of foam and also the lace foam that remains as you pour
4998944 people who drink beer also want to find out more about their brands i take them on a tour of the brewery give a history of beer an understanding of the beer making process as well as tell them about the health benefits of drinking beer in moderation
4998945 i always say that we would rather have more people drinking less than have less people drinking more that is our motto
4998946 consumers are becoming a lot more discerning they want to have a wide choice and the big trend is moving to the premium beers so you need constantly to come up with new beers new packages to excite the consumer
4998947 as rambos creator i have experience in that regard and if your idea of a good time is to be forced to get an unlisted phone number swear your friends to secrecy about your address and make sure your doors are locked because of stalkers youre welcome to it

4998951 summary despite huge investment in school ict over recent years there have been relatively few if any reports of the substantial transformation of teaching and learning expected by governments as a result of this funding glow the scottish schools digital network is the latest of these costly initiatives this research study tracked four s3 classes working through the same modules as part of the standard grade biology course results were tested using summative instruments of assessment comprising topic specific questions from past standard grade biology papers and an end of year exam one class after two modules taught without it studied one module using ict timetabled for one of three lessons each week over one school term with a mixture of independent and collaborative learning tasks reinforcing the learning objectives for that week delivered using the glow virtual learning environment results for this class with the same pupils and the same teacher showed a mean increase of 32 27 for the glow vs non glow modules the attainment of this class on the non glow modules was consistent and significantly below the best of the four classes however on the glow module it was better by 14 69 than the mean of the other three classes further examination of the results showed that the weaker students benefited at least as much as their more able classmates the report discusses the challenges of embedding ict into subject curricula and makes suggestions for a model of good practice this use of ict could facilitate a partial move away from a predominantly subject based focus in teaching to the more applied approach as advocated by a curriculum for excellence

4998994 in dieser frage bewegung das zeigen die neuen umfragen leider ist die stimmung hier noch verh rtet das verstehe ich nicht und ich w nschte mir es w rde sachbezogener und weniger emotional diskutiert werden

4999012 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
4999013 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
4999014 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4999015 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4999016 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4999017 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero

4999019 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4999020 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4999021 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4999022 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4999023 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4999024 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4999025 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4999026 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4999027 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4999028 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4999029 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4999030 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4999031 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4999032 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4999033 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4999034 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4999035 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4999036 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4999037 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4999038 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4999039 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4999040 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4999041 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4999042 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4999043 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4999044 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4999045 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4999046 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4999047 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4999048 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4999049 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4999050 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4999051 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4999052 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4999053 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4999054 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4999055 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4999056 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4999057 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4999058 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4999059 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4999060 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4999061 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4999062 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4999063 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4999064 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4999065 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4999066 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4999067 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4999068 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4999069 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4999070 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4999071 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4999072 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4999073 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4999074 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4999075 well dan my portfolio is pretty tied up in food and shelter
4999076 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4999077 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4999078 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4999079 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4999080 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4999081 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4999082 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4999083 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4999084 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4999085 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4999086 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4999087 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4999088 curiously it so happens that the question who governs britain which at the moment is being frivolously posed might be taken in real earnest as the title of what i have to say this is the first and last election at which the british people will be given the opportunity to decide whether their country is to remain a democratic nation governed by the will of its own electorate expressed in its own parliament or whether it will become one province in a new european superstate under institutions which know nothing of the political rights and liberties that we have so long taken for granted
4999089 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4999090 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4999091 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4999092 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4999093 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4999094 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4999095 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4999096 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4999097 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4999098 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4999099 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4999100 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4999101 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4999102 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4999103 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4999104 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4999105 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4999106 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4999107 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4999108 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4999109 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4999110 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4999111 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4999112 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4999113 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4999114 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4999115 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

4999124 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4999125 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4999126 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4999127 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4999128 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4999129 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4999130 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4999131 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4999132 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4999133 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4999134 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4999135 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4999136 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4999137 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4999138 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4999139 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4999140 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4999141 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4999142 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4999143 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4999144 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4999145 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4999146 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

4999302 de afgelopen weken ontstond er al veel commotie rond het ontslag van chris comvalius uit goede tijden slechte tijden het lijkt slechts stilte voor de storm want er dreigen meer ontslagen in de dagelijkse 22 minuten zendtijd van de soap is ruimte voor 18 personages door de komst van de familie huygens kwamen er aan het einde van vorig seizoen opeens vier karakters bij naast comvalius moeten er op korte termijn nog drie personages uit de serie worden geschreven welke acteurs of actrices buiten de boot gaan vallen is nog niet bekend er zullen dit jaar naast dennis en dorothea nog drie personages uit de serie verdwijnen overigens zijn we ook aan het kijken of het mogelijk is om nog meer nieuwe karakters te introduceren aldus een woordvoerder van rtl nederland

4999306 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services its a huge issue for public health but it also risks placing an unprecedented amount of pressure on council services
4999307 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
4999308 even then the care proceedings may well have been instigated because of related problems rather than exclusively because of their weight
4999309 can have very serious consequences for a childs health and the parental behaviour that leads to childhood obesity can be a form of neglect
4999310 children who are dangerously overweight should be brought into hospital where they can be given 24 hour care for several weeks or months but their parents should have access to them
4999311 it would be better to help the parents provide better nutrition for their child rather than break up the family
4999312 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre

4999320 the us government is strongly opposed to restrictive trade practices or boycotts targeted at israel
4999321 the commerce department is closely monitoring efforts that appear to be made to reinvigorate the arab boycott of israel and will use all of its resources to vigorously enforce us anti boycott regulations
4999322 yes of course the boycott is still in place and is still enforced

4999326 it is not only the jurors right but his duty to find the verdict according to his own best understanding judgment and conscience though in direct opposition to the direction of the court
4999327 for more than six hundred years that is since magna carta in 1215 there has been no clearer principle of english or american constitutional law than that in criminal cases it is not only the right and duty of juries to judge what are the facts what is the law and what was the moral intent of the accused but that it is also their right and their primary and paramount duty to judge of the justice of the law and to hold all laws invalid that are in their opinion unjust or oppressive and all persons guiltless in violating or resisting the execution of such laws

4999377 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
4999378 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have had seven years to deliver on their pledges that these games would further human rights

4999399 dan jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil terhadap hak hak perempuan yatim bilamana kamu mengawininya maka kawinilah wanita wanita lain yang kamu senangi dua tiga atau empat kemudian jika kamu takut tidak akan dapat berlaku adil maka kawinilah seorang saja atau budak budak yang kamu miliki yang demikian itu adalah lebih dekat kepada tidak berbuat aniaya
4999400 menetaplah kalian wahai istri istri nabi di rumah rumah kalian
4999401 apakah engkau menyangka allah dan rasul nya akan berbuat tidak adil kepadamu
4999402 hal ini aku lakukan bukan sebagai penghinaan kepada keluargamu bila memang engkau mau aku akan menginap bersamamu selama tujuh hari namun aku pun akan menggilir istri istriku yang lain selama tujuh hari
4999403 dan kamu sekali kali tiadak dapat berlaku adil di antara isteri isteri mu walaupun kamu sangat ingin demikian
4999404 ya allah inilah pembagianku yang aku mampu maka janganlah engkaucela aku pada apa yang engkau miliki dan tidak aku miliki yaitu hati
4999405 dijadikan sebagian hak istri adalah menyembunyikan perasaan lebih mencintai salah satu istri terhadap istri yang lain

4999440 if you wait long enough everything comes back into fashion
4999441 i wasnt really focusing on it too much i was really just trying to get out of that first inning since i havent pitched in ten days and i didnt have a really good feel for the ball i came out and i was rushing my tempo a bit so i was just focusing on settling down and making it through the first inning after that it was about slowing my pace down and making pitches
4999442 i thought he started slow and finished strong his tempo was a little quick there the first few innings it was nice to see him make the adjustment starting in the third inning where he got his tempo back down to his pace i think that was the key to the game because it allowed him to make his pitches it allowed him to settle back down into his own pace ive had one guy throw a no hitter in 2003 bronson arroyo there was one other but i cant remember bronson threw one in 2003 but weve had a handful of others take no hitters late into the ballgame only to lose them
4999443 i guess i was effectively wild i mean i made some pitches when i had to the defense played good i tried to throw my breaking stuff a little more if you throw the curveball and slider more it forces you to stay back and have sound mechanics i think once i started throwing the curveball for strikes my fastball really took off i think i carried a no hitter into the seventh earlier in the year against akron but i think tonight was the furthest ive gone
4999444 lets put it to you this way it would have made things very difficult for us we would have really thought about it
4999445 i have never called a no hitter granted ive been playing in aluminum bat leagues for a while so its kinda tough to throw a no hitter but jason had great stuff tonight his command was a little off having not pitched in ten days but thats to be expected he had great stuff and he was able to compete and take us deep when a guys got that kind of stuff you just let him go i was just staying back and not saying anything

4999457 women are at the top of the list with what keeps me alive and young and i dont hang around with old people
4999458 everybody that i know is at least 10 or 20 years younger than i am my wife annie is 24 years younger than i am
4999459 my oldest daughter once said dad how come you dont hang around with women your own age and i said listen women my age are usually a lot older than me
4999460 part of the secret to staying young is dont hang around with people your own age because youll get old with them hang out with the young people and youll stay young
4999461 i discovered that life begins at 60 the reason is by the time you get to be 60 you just dont care what happens youve done it all and you suddenly feel free about everything

4999473 i gave tita king her first and last music theater piece
4999474 dr kasilag has consistently devoted herself to the pursuit of excellence specifically in music in her cultural leadership and interrelationships with students colleagues and friends her autobiography reflects her greatness as a person as she shares her joys and experiences with depth and meaning through her interactions with musical masters all over the world she exemplifies the artist as conscience of the world
4999475 we mourn the death of a great pillar of philippine music and culture long live tita king
4999476 i consider her an icon and of course during her years at ccp she initiated the formation of the young artists foundation the national music competition for young artists namcya and other programs which benefited young talents and that included me her years at the ccp was the golden age of the growth of all the arts specially music i will miss her presence in my concerts
4999477 tita king is the mother of all filipino artists during her healthy years she never missed a concert art exhibits book launching or any cultural event when i was doing my cultural research at eastman she practically mailed all her piano works and entrusted the interpretation of her music to me thats how giving she is
4999478 tita king is the philippine pioneer in the creation of filipino avante garde music this country i was her willing guinea pig in her experiments of vocal music which were then considered a novelty her original music and arrangements of folk songs always have an underpinning of humor which were reflective of her witty self underneath a scary bespectacled exterior
4999479 her innovative musical fusion of eastern and western technique form and style enriched philippine music without distracting from each others uniqueness
4999480 we in the orchestral music scene consider kasilags philippine scenes as one of the big four filipino orchestral works alongside buenaventuras by the hillside san pedros buwan sa kabundukan and penas igorot rhapsody
4999481 she is always hardworking and very focused i performed her folksongs in florence italy for my masters degree and her song cycle with prof regalado jose at the concert at the park id like to think she contributed a lot to the development of philippine music
4999482 about five years ago mowelfund honored her at the ccp
4999483 she cared and she gave her very all to the music industry
4999484 she was an amazingly ageless modern youthful and prolific artist she was my idol and ninang who inspired countless other artists she will live forever through her music
4999485 tita king inspired a whole generation of young musicians and it is but fitting that we dedicate this competition to her who was also one of the moving force behind this program for young artists

4999490 the people were great to have the tone and the voice and their perspective we just had everything from the extras to all the african talent they were amazing
4999491 we had extras on a street shoot out scene and they literally hit the pavement during the shoot out
4999492 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
4999493 katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
4999494 katy is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself at the moment
4999495 we cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child but she knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin

4999596 can you provide any documentation or evidence of your claim that two different securities which attempt to track the same index will not cause an investor to run afoul of the wash sale rule
4999597 tax courts have ruled that if you swap the securities of one company for the securities of an unrelated company then the securities are not identical and a tax loss is allowed therefore swapping a vanguard mutual fund for a schwab mutual fund should not create a tax wash lets apply the same precedence to index funds if you sold the vanguard 500 fund at a loss and simultaneously purchased the schwab s amp p 500 index fund for the same amount in my opinion a legitimate tax loss in created
4999598 theres some debate but no direct authority on the question of whether two mutual funds keying off the same index are substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule can you sell one s amp p 500 index fund at a loss and buy a different s amp p 500 fund the same day without having a wash sale because there is no direct authority dealing with this question reasonable minds may disagree its always possible to identify differences between funds managed by different companies such as expense ratios and tax load some people conclude on this basis that funds maintained by two different companies are never substantially identical my feeling is that those differences arent enough to prevent the two funds from being substantially identical the point of the wash sale rule is to determine whether youve changed your position relative to the market if you can lay the price graph for your new investment on top of the price graph for the old one and never see a significant disparity as would be the case for two high quality s amp p 500 funds the investments should be considered substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule

4999608 was not only taught by the apostles and lived in familiar intercourse with many that had seen christ but also received his appointment in asia from the apostles as bishop in the church of smyrna
4999609 i ask you also who are a true co worker to help these women for they have labored side by side with me in the gospel together with clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life
4999610 in charge of the teaching of the divine message for nine years in all
4999611 the church of god which sojourns at rome to the church of god sojourning at corinth
4999612 obedient to those who had the rule over you and giving all fitting honour to the presbyters among you
4999613 moreover you were all distinguished by humility and were in no respect puffed up with pride but yielded obedience rather than extorted it and were more willing to give than to receive
4999614 every kind of faction and schism was abominable in your sight
4999615 for this reason righteousness and peace are now far departed from you inasmuch as every one abandons the fear of god and is become blind in his faith neither walks in the ordinances of his appointment nor acts a part becoming a christian but walks after his own wicked lusts resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy by which death itself entered into the world
4999616 it is right and holy therefore men and brethren rather to obey god than to follow those who through pride and sedition have become the leaders of a detestable emulation
4999617 let us cleave therefore to those who cultivate peace with godliness and not to those who hypocritically profess to desire it
4999618 thus the humility and godly submission of so great and illustrious men have rendered not only us but also all the generations before us better
4999619 but who are his enemies all the wicked and those who set themselves to oppose the will of god
4999620 let us take our body for an example the head is nothing without the feet and the feet are nothing without the head yea the very smallest members of our body are necessary and useful to the whole body but all work harmoniously together and are under one common rule for the preservation of the whole body
4999621 not in every place brethren are the daily sacrifices offered or the peace offerings or the sin offerings and the trespass offerings but in jerusalem only and even there they are not offered in any place but only at the altar before the temple that which is offered being first carefully examined by the high priest and the ministers already mentioned those therefore who do anything beyond that which is agreeable to his will are punished with death you see brethren that the greater the knowledge that has been vouchsafed to us the greater also is the danger to which we are exposed
4999622 my teaching is not mine but his who sent me
4999623 i received from the lord what i also delivered to you
4999624 but now reflect who those are that have perverted you and lessened the renown of your far famed brotherly love it is disgraceful beloved yea highly disgraceful and unworthy of your christian profession that such a thing should be heard of as that the most steadfast and ancient church of the corinthians should on account of one or two persons engage in sedition against its presbyters and this rumour has reached not only us but those also who are unconnected with us so that through your infatuation the name of the lord is blasphemed while danger is also brought upon yourselves
4999625 if however any shall disobey the words spoken by him through us let them know that they will involve themselves in transgression and serious danger
4999626 right is it therefore to approach examples so good and so many and submit the neck and fulfil the part of obedience in order that undisturbed by vain sedition we may attain unto the goal set before us in truth wholly free from blame
4999627 send back speedily to us in peace and with joy these our messengers to you claudius ephebus and valerius bito with fortunatus that they may the sooner announce to us the peace and harmony we so earnestly desire and long for among you and that we may the more quickly rejoice over the good order re established among you

4999637 i feel reasonably comfortable about the process doing it the way i have outlined that i do it and not getting involved in voting for a particular candidate or advocating for a particular candidate
4999638 i made a personal policy decision that i would not weigh in for or against a particular name and that is the way i have always proceeded
4999639 in fact i do not vote except i reserve the right to vote in the rare case of a tie im told that i voted once to break a tie i dont have a recollection of that my recollection is that i have never voted

4999950 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4999951 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4999952 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4999953 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group

4999961 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4999962 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4999963 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4999964 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4999965 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4999966 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4999967 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4999968 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4999969 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4999970 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4999971 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4999972 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4999973 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4999974 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4999975 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4999976 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4999977 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4999978 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4999979 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4999980 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4999981 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4999982 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4999983 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4999984 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4999985 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4999986 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4999987 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4999988 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4999989 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4999990 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4999991 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4999992 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4999993 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4999994 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4999995 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4999996 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4999997 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4999998 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4999999 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
