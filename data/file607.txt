6070000 plus the fact russians still require visa to travel nearly to every foreign destination majority of customers are forced to book their trips through traditional offline agents in order to be able to apply for visa as a result of visa regulations for russians the last minute air or travel package offers are nearly non existent except for turkey or egypt tour packages
6070001 as for the russian federation local hotel bookings the general lack of technology and mentality of hoteliers in various regions result close to zero online availability of those hotels plus russian immigration rules to foreigners are making it impossible for tourists from other countries to freely travel or go for last minute travel along russian territories those potential tourists could have pushed russian region hotels with bookable online capability but that not has been the case
6070002 its clear that the share of online bookings will grow but how exactly we will know only by the end of this year when sales figures will be revealed
6070003 from this perspective the support to online travel development is tremendous though the cost of credit card acquiring is still a painful point as its 3 3 5 percent comes in with agencys only five percent mark up for the sold service such a high cost of acquiring forces online travel companies to look for alternative ways for payment settlements but obviously holds back the development of industry in general
6070004 online travel agencies benefited well from this trend attracting consumers through great availability at a wide breadth of hotel options
6070005 but they too will feel the impact that the 2008 recession and flight capacity reductions will have on the hotel sector
6070006 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6070007 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6070008 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6070009 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option
6070010 i ask basic questions what are you going to do in the shoe
6070011 we can check the wear patterns to see if that shoe is correct for you
6070012 some people want one shoe for everything and thats just not possible today
6070013 dont wear a running shoe for volleyball running is a straight forward activity volleyball is back and forth running shoes dont have any lateral support so youll roll an ankle
6070014 that helps transition as you pull your toe up and makes the transition smoother since you dont leave the ground
6070015 a true crosstrainer used to be something cut a little higher
6070016 the big thing these days is how the midsole is set up if you have an unstable midsole youre going to roll your ankle
6070017 we developed footwear in concert with sparq to support that kind of training activity and launched in march and april
6070018 that is the shoe that can stand up to different activities

6070022 the property enjoys an absolute beachfront position on four mile beach occupying approximately 109ha of land featuring tropical landscaped gardens and an 18 hole golf course
6070023 one of the key attributes of the property is the surplus development land on offer which includes a 15 77ha parcel of land which has been earmarked for the future development of 76 residential allotments some of which will front four mile beach
6070024 the back nine holes of the golf course also offer excellent development potential including a 25 62ha parcel of land which has the potential for approximately 80 residential allotments most of which will benefit from views up the golf course fairways
6070025 with the property long being recognised as one of tropical north queenslands premier resorts an opportunity now exists to acquire this asset at a fraction of its replacement cost
6070026 strong capital growth opportunities can be achieved by undertaking a refurbishment and then repositioning the existing resort facilities as well as developing the extensive adjoining vacant land
6070027 the resorts ongoing popularity is due to its enviable beachfront location and close proximity to the world heritage listed great barrier reef and daintree rainforest as well as the mossman gorge
6070028 we anticipate the property will attract interest from domestic and international investors alike as well as developers seeking to capitalise on the significant land holding

6070084 zaheer did the job for us as he bowled in right areas credit also goes to badrinath as he had not played sri lankan spinners ajantha mendis and muttiah muralitharan before
6070085 we needed this victory there was pressure on us especially after losing opener gautam gambhir stiff neck before the match we would have liked to win comfortably but in the end it is about winning
6070086 we knew we could win this match only by getting wickets we tried hard but dhoni and badrinath batted really well and their partnership took the game away from us
6070087 the important thing was to be consistent and bowl in right areas
6070088 as a spearhead of the attack it was important for me to provide early breakthroughs all the bowlers did well and kept pressure on their batsmen

6070136 the conclusion flatly contradicts two independent studies that have been done one by policy matters of ohio in cleveland and the institute for womens policy research in washington
6070137 they looked at less lost productivity because sick workers tend to be less productive than healthy workers and because there would be less spread illness in the workplace faster recuperation times and improved retention of skilled employees
6070138 the study was conducted using the business size input model program of the regional economic models inc input output system the system produces short and long term forecasts for detailed industry sectors when external shocks are applied specifically the model estimates future changes in jobs output sales income and productivity for ohio by business size and industry by comparing forecasts without change to forecasts with change the mandate the shock in this research is the additional sick leave costs which are calculated to represent one percent of employee compensation based on federal bureau of labor statistics compensation data as well as record keeping and bookkeeping expenses note that overtime and replacement worker costs are not included in the cost analysis and would substantially increase the costs of the mandate if applied moreover the research does not account for the additional costs placed on employers who currently provide paid sick leave but must comply with the additional administrative mandates

6070164 whilst normal sweating regulates body temperature excessive sweating can be chronically embarrassing sufferers can feel uncomfortable in social situations and start avoiding them caused by an overreaction by the sympathetic nervous system hands feet and armpits are the most affected due to the higher concentration of eecrine or sweat glands for example there are approximately 500 glands per square centimetre in the palms of the hands botox treatments are one of the most affective long lasting and minimally invasive treatments that puts a stop to excessive sweating
6070165 but its not just those with a severe problem my patients include those whose nervousness when presenting gets them sweating severely in front of hundreds of people and shy men and women who break out in a sweat in nerve wracking social situations first dates and when meeting new people many of my patients feel that not having to worry about getting uncomfortably sweaty whilst travelling at work and at parties is a big boost to their confidence in both business and social situations especially during summer
6070166 before i tried botox my body hands and feet felt clammy with sweat most of the time shaking hands with new people was a trial i always had to explain to them about my sweaty hands i found social situations daunting but the botox treatments have been incredibly effective after experimenting with endless deodorants and diets its great to find something that actually works

6070171 there are so many variables in bringing a production to broadway theater availability artists schedules and securing capitalization to name but a few

6070180 character integrity hes been a winner all the way up
6070181 he has a lot of great features were really pleased
6070182 when you get compared to another player of trevors ability at a young age it goes a long ways i think it will make him a better player he takes everything in
6070183 character and leadership is i think what you can say about this individual
6070184 i think in this day and age that carries a player a long ways along with skill and ability theres no rush its not a race to get there for him itd probably be best for him to play at the junior level
6070185 i didnt meet my goals for the season i was looking to get in upwards of 20 points probably
6070186 at the end of the year i was feeling a lot better im just continuing to work out in the weight room and hopefully my experience and my strength will carry over from this past year into next year
6070187 he was a raw rookie going into college hockey last year i think he just got stronger as the season went along he was played in a lot of different positions from center to wing there was a lot of things thrown at him but he handled every situation i think he made himself better as the season went along
6070188 im sure hed like to get there quicker but hes definitely a pure goal scorer its all about getting the opportunity when he gets the opportunity he gets those opportunities by his speed
6070189 what he does really well is he plays at a consistent level
6070190 thats what you like to see out of players you know what youre going to get out of him night after night i know hes a little older but he still wants that opportunity and hes showed when he has that hes really proven himself i think thats a real key for him
6070191 i think its in his hands like all these players
6070192 he has to improve on a few things to make himself better if he does then hes going to have a better chance hes got to come into camp with the attitude that hes going to take someones job
6070193 he was one of our better players from christmas on down in manitoba hes had a little taste of the nhl and knows how to handle pressure situations hes just got to take that step hes going into his third year pro and he has to go into camp and prove himself every night theres no easy nights for him he has the ability and the strength to do that its a push to take that next step and hes going to be pushed i know the coaching staffs going to be pushing him
6070194 i think things have happened very quickly for him and he has to play an all around game he has some skill but his all around game has to come into play hes coming along he looks really well with his conditioning
6070195 i really really like the way he plays he has to play that style he came up last year for us and did that hes a banger crash em type of player that can kill player hes another guy thats going to get an opportunity and he knows what he has to do to play at the next level
6070196 he makes easy plays all those sort of things you like in a solid defenseman i think the biggest thing is the way he competes he makes it miserable on whoever hes playing against
6070197 i think the biggest thing for him is to play a nice solid controlled game
6070198 he has a tendency to put himself out of position by just being over aggressive thats just a matter of time and learning as he goes along hes very solid and hes going to be able to shut down any of the top lines
6070199 hes a guy that competes every night you know what youre going to get from him hes a hard nosed miserable guy to play against he knows how to throw the better players off their game
6070200 hes gotten more ice time and he really improved as the season went along hes very solid and strong the skating is the tool he has to keep working on and hes improved in that area a lot from the start of the year
6070201 he came over from sweden to get to know the north american game
6070202 hes gotten more ice time and he really improved as the season went along hes very solid and strong the skating is the tool he has to keep working on and hes improved in that area a lot from the start of the year
6070203 he can shoot the puck a power play type of guy
6070204 the adjustment coming from college to pro is a big adjustment i think you saw it in his play earlier in the season but he really adjusted to it he picks up on a lot of things he really improved right around christmas he really earned his position to be the no 1 in manitoba going into playoffs he was very solid for us
6070205 where do you fit as a goaltender within our organization thats a big mental part of it but youve got to go out and prove yourself night after night you cant look at whats ahead of you you can learn from the guy ahead of you but youve got to be own self as a goaltender
6070206 hes a quick goaltender i think when youre a goaltender and you have the reflexes you have to be in tip top shape

6070309 this marks the official beginning of my campaign to represent the families of taney county with experience efficiency and respect
6070310 the residents of taney county showed overwhelming support during the signature drive and i look forward to getting out in the community and meeting as many people as i can in the next couple of months
6070311 deborah has the work ethic and dedication to the community that taney county deserves in a coroner
6070312 h ad it not been for the excellent police work of the branson police department and boone county sheriffs department a killer would still be at large this is a tragic event that is uncharacteristic for our community and the city of branson
6070313 the successful testing of evidence in this case demonstrates that there is a real need for a regional crime lab in springfield to assist in evidence testing as a quick turnaround of dna and blood analysis is so important in cases with such tragic circumstances
6070314 i expect its going to be chaotic in here today
6070315 i woke up and was surprised the storm wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
6070316 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6070317 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6070318 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6070319 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up

6070323 soliciting sealed proposals for the sale of real property commonly known as forsythe street
6070324 the best responsible bidder shall include as part of its proposal title in a form acceptable to the city for an alternate street right of way that provides equal or better street connectivity in the branson street network in that area of the city the alternate alignment
6070325 mr miller per your request for proposal for the sale of the forsythe street property tanstone group llc would like to submit a bid of one dollar 1 00 as per the terms and conditions of sale please find the attached right away exhibit that provides a better alternate alignment kind regards chris dejohn the tanstone group llc
6070326 this will allow an alternate street right of way that provides better street connectivity in the branson street network in that area of the city alignment with green mountain drive will allow the placement of traffic signals on highway 76 as had been the desired configuration previously announced by the city the alternate alignment will also ensure access from the remaining property owned by patobin enterprises
6070327 the responsible bidder shall submit a title to the city for an alternate street right of way that provides equal or better street connectivity in the citys overall street system so in effect we wanted an alternate road we didnt say anything about price or anything that was a term or condition of sale a new road
6070328 one from tanstone group for the new road that they are building
6070329 it went down and would tie into oak creek drive which does not exist so technically it did not meet the terms and conditions because there is no through road to tie into because tanstone hasnt given us that right of way
6070330 i believe that the bid met all the requirements of citys solicitation
6070331 theres definitely a problem where people are so busy documenting the moment that they forget to just live in the moment

6070336 this allows cowards to hide and this is why voters are losing faith in our electoral system
6070337 i apologize to all who are the victims of this hoax
6070338 he assured me that this isnt the real republican party unfortunately the dirty trick wing has taken control but not for too much longer
6070339 of all the endorsements ive received the endorsement from all three living former democratic lieutenant governors is the one people find most significant

6070341 sam pages experience and record make him the best choice for the august 5 democratic lieutenant governor primary
6070342 his experience in healthcare seniors issues and veterans care make him the best person for the job
6070343 we called the police my wife was afraid he was going to get ran over or hit
6070344 he looked a little agitated but other than that he didnt look to be falling down drunk or anything like that

6070359 has an edge based on his leadership role and prosecutorial experience
6070360 the stars endorsement absolutely affirms our commitment to campaign in every corner of the missouri
6070361 voters want an attorney general who will fight for them we have built the strongest statewide campaign and voters are embracing our common sense agenda and our message for strong leadership
6070362 he effectively managed diverse interests which is no small task
6070363 he wants to use the office to emphasize open government and preservation of public records for starters
6070364 as a legislator he worked to protect missouris environment from pollution by factory farms he also championed limits on campaign donations
6070365 those are ideas that would carry over well into the job of attorney general
6070366 over the last three and a half years my administration has created a more open and accountable state government for missouri taxpayers and one of the ways we have achieved this is by leaving the old way behind and using technology to bring state government services into the 21st century
6070367 this internet site is another example of how we are providing missourians with important and easy to access information now missourians will have easier access to information pertaining to cases that come before the administrative hearing commission
6070368 we are excited to introduce this new internet access to the public this site will allow access to our case information to anyone with access to a computer 24 hours a day 7 days a week we have worked hard to produce and refine this internet site to make it convenient and to improve customer service by taking advantage of technology to better serve the citizens of missouri it will enhance our efficiency as well as those who seek this information
6070369 strong conservative management of missouris budget over the last three and a half years has turned a 1 1 billion deficit into three consecutive surpluses while cutting taxes and increasing education funding by 1 2 billion which is the largest such increase without a tax increase in missouris history
6070370 now some politicians want to spend the surplus on a big government welfare program that was nearly bankrupt before we reformed the system despite liberal assertions the changes we made to save medicaid represent less than half of the changes we made to get spending under control in 2005 responsible budgeting has placed missouri in the small category of states that are not experiencing budget shortfalls deficits and other problems plaguing their fiscal stability now is not the time to increase the size of government by spending the surplus on big government welfare programs especially those we have successfully reformed by attacking waste and fraud and removing ineligible participants because of the surplus radical proposals to dramatically increase welfare spending might be sustainable for a few years but they will eventually drive the state to either bankruptcy or a tax increase
6070371 we must remain committed to being responsible with missouris hard earned tax dollars
6070372 the spending proposals of liberal politicians would return us to the old broken system and lead towards another spending crisis if we are going to spend additional state funds we should continue down the path i have led our state over the last three and a half years by ending the education cuts and withholdings and increasing education funding to ensure our children are prepared to compete for jobs in our global economy

6070457 since ian paisley junior suffered the humiliation of being forced from ministerial office his contributions to pubic debate have been increasingly nonsensical and irrelevant this latest outburst certainly falls into that category

6070459 political parties and campaign groups alike should be required to submit a declaration of expenditure to the standards in public office commission following a referendum campaign
6070460 there is a responsibility on all of us who campaigned for and against the lisbon treaty to be transparent in how individual campaigns were financed and monies spent
6070461 sinn f ins total campaign expenditure for the lisbon treaty referendum campaign was 118 907 68 the bulk of this spend was on campaign posters which cost 66 871 10 to produce in addition the party spent 20 231 70 on media advertising and 27 939 53 on printed materials
6070462 the campaign was funded by sinn f in centrally with much of the financial outlay on printed materials repaid by partys local organisations a 20 000 contribution from sinn f ins eu parliamentary group gue ngl and a public appeal for donations the largest of which was 650
6070463 it is worth noting that the distribution of all the partys campaign literature was done by party activists and supporters over the course of the campaign
6070464 last week sinn f in publishedits annual financial statements for both the north and south political parties in the north are required under law to provide a full income and expenditure annual financial statement to the electoral commission

6070480 this is an unacceptable situation graduates have worked hard for their degrees yet are not able to get the award from the university because the student loan company has not paid the relevant fees
6070481 while universities have long used this mechanism to ensure that all outstanding money owed to them is paid the situation is placing more pressure on students who now have such huge levels of debt when they leave university
6070482 parents of students i have spoken to have taken out loans and paid upwards of 1 300 by credit cards directly to universities to ensure that their son or daughter has the honour they deserve of graduating and receiving their diploma they worked so hard for instead of receiving a blank scroll
6070483 parents in this situation now have to pay off those credit card bills and loans as several weeks later the universities concerned have been unable to reimburse them as the student loan company has still not paid outstanding accounts
6070484 i am calling on the higher education minister reg empey to directly intervene and contact the student loan company and use his ministerial office to bring pressure on them to pay all outstanding accounts
6070485 the department has a statutory duty to encourage and facilitate the development of irish medium education and i examine each proposal on a fair and consistent basis

6070487 sinn f in is the fastest growing political party in ireland we are activist based and have members all over the country our task is to build a country where all the people are treated equally regardless of religion income gender ethnicity or geography
6070488 there are countless roles for everyone to play in our rapidly growing party from joining and adding to the important work of local cumainn to assisting our hard working election teams through to helping the party grow in tandem with developing technological advances these are only some of the areas where sinn fein would like to harness the energy commitment and enthusiasm of everyone to achieve our aims and take society in ireland confidently into the coming years and decades
6070489 currently people can phone walk in or send an email to apply to join sinn f in the email system in recent times has been the most successful
6070490 we recognise that almost everyone has a mobile phone so why not text to join the party has set up a 5 digit number and from now on people can text join followed by their name and address to 60060 and apply to join by text

6070494 i am extremely disappointed at the unionist parties on craigavon borough council with an opportunity to show leadership and send out a signal to the nationalist and republican community that the council is open to everyone they failed to rise to the challenge

6070509 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6070510 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing

6070528 to her all my decisions seemed absolutely arbitrary as though i could just as well have selected anything at all and therefore there was no meaning and that made it ugly so i told her that if i were to describe the way she was dressed it might sound very much like what shed been saying for instance she had feathers on her head and she had this enamel brooch with a picture of the blue boy on it pinned to her breast and around her neck she had on what she would call mink but what could also be described as the skin of a dead animal well at first she was a little offended by this i think but then later she came back and said she was beginning to understand

6070606 after years of personal struggle of study of conversations i believe that people who are gay are created that way
6070607 who am i to deny something that god has created
6070608 i always felt i could talk to bob and he would give me a straight answer
6070609 thats not the case with every bishop hes upfront and tells you where hes coming from which i always appreciated we disagreed on homosexuality but he didnt hold it against you we talked openly and honestly and went on our way
6070610 im so sorry i hope i did not get hurt

6070613 i hope we could be free from the misconceptions of the people around us whats normal in this world anyway
6070614 calm down dont be too serious you might hurt yourself
6070615 it has always been a struggle for most of us and in someway we always tried to be normal but in the end well realize that this is what we are and we dont need to change that

6070618 kami tidak tahu menahu adanya sambutan itu di lapangan terbang dan kenapa pihak tersebut tidak memaklumkan kepada kami tentang sambutan itu sebenarnya kami sudah sampai lebih awal dan yang penting chong wei telah selamat sampai ke sini untuk bertemu penduduk kampungnya
6070619 this cowardly attack will not only have any affect on our cooperation with afghanistan but it will even strengthen our will in the fight against terrorism
6070620 your struggle in afghanistan is important for the freedom of the world and it should be continued
6070621 penrith and eden are low crime areas but we have little spots like this where somebody can decide to kick off and we want to make sure it is dealt with we have been looking at how to improve this area for 12 to 18 months we will be reviewing how this goes over the next few months
6070622 people know that the cameras are there and they make a fantastic deterrent we have had assaults and burglaries and incidents that cause concern

6070625 im playing a negative role which has various shades it really interested me it is more like what al pacino has played in many of his movies
6070626 though im the first person in our family who is playing a negative character my father is very supportive
6070627 shammiji said whatever role you play do it with your heart and soul and give your best
6070628 the reason for casting aditya in the negative role will only be known when the film is released
6070629 shamita used to give her 100 to the projects she undertook as a fashion designer she was brilliant at mixing and matching fabrics and would have definitely been an asset to the fashion world
6070630 all who seek god dess are welcome at the holy communion meal
6070631 when the tibetan bowl rings a third time please stand
6070632 i began to think about our language and our metaphors and our teaching of the holy others
6070633 can language create who we are and if it creates who we are can it also hinder who we mean to be
6070634 in my mind the question arises does god have a penis does god have to have a penis
6070635 the answer is no and i dont think anybody that has thought about it would ever say that absolutely god has to have a penis or else
6070636 and if god doesnt have to have a penis god can easily be goddess as well
6070637 the lifting up of the female imagery is not to do away with one and become another domination structure
6070638 its not the opposite of patriarchy but rather a partnership model of egalitarian nature
6070639 i think this path supports justice towards all and a peaceful setting
6070640 everything we do is more about a loving atmosphere empowerment inclusiveness everyone is welcome here
6070641 i might claim to be the first to put those two together
6070642 so that the feminine is explicit i chose to use sophia instead of just christ wisdom
6070643 when you have an exclusively masculine theology you have a foundation for demeaning devaluing and abusing women
6070644 if our sacred symbols are not equal what about our values
6070645 divine feminine images can contribute to bringing down patriarchal structures
6070646 i think that there is a deep hunger for the healing of the world for bringing back this balance
6070647 now i think its crucial to have the divine feminine in the forefront for saving of the world to nurture instead of blowing it up
6070648 because the divine continues to be associated so much with the masculine until you bring the feminine women will still be seen in some secondary kind of way
6070649 if you cannot also say god dess then you cant believe that god is both or neither gender
6070650 this church was all danish and swedish when i joined
6070651 we used to have 80 some kids here and each one of those plaques you see with my name on them is from a year that we did the my city my world camp
6070652 i find references to god as neutral but the fact is people dont people anthropomorphize god into a male image and thats of course very limiting of what god is and what we understand god to be
6070653 at the church we have to constantly be looking at the language were using so that it speaks to people and doesnt stay anchored in medieval times
6070654 this is one of the reasons the church is dying we are not responding to the changes that are happening so quickly
6070655 martin luther was the first reformer of the christian church and ever since then weve being trying to look at things in light of the context that we live in
6070656 he did that back in the 1500s and weve been doing the same thing ever since
6070657 it just really felt like everything the ritual the hierarchy was being deconstructed
6070658 thats really where ive come to realize that having god as a masculine image isnt a fundamental

6070668 and best of all whenever he slips up the media is there to make an exception for him
6070669 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
6070670 you know youre never too old to burn your bridges because i believe i have offended everyone
6070671 i think ive got a couple more ill burn that bridge when i come to it is my favorite phrase ive ever coined
6070672 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
6070673 i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6070674 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer

6070686 it should be in every rucksack for those times when soldiers need spiritual energy
6070687 in the process of securing comments for recommending the book i believe there was a basic misunderstanding on my part that the comments were publishable
6070688 were intended for me personally rather than for the general public
6070689 and unless someone like military com notes it we would not be aware of it
6070690 we dont get the stateside papers in baghdad and i doubt very much that gen petraeus goes to amazon com much if at all
6070691 mrff is now officially putting both army chaplain lt col bill mccoy and general petraeus on notice not to destroy any of the written or electronic records of their communications about this issue
6070692 general petraeus has by his own hand become a quintessential poster child of this fundamentalist christian religious predation via his unadulterated and shocking public endorsement of a book touting both christian supremacy and exceptionalism
6070693 he should still be relieved of duty and court martialed
6070694 so the icece would support what general patreaus has done
6070695 agenda to be more important than the units agenda and thus lead to unit failure
6070696 no one else has written a book which allows for varying world views and perspectives while suggesting the gospel might have an idea worth considering under orders does just that

6070702 its to everyone out there that you have to work hard ive been through a lot of ups and downs but ive seen a lot of good things along the way i was able to use the negativism in a good light and say after my accident i can still do it if i work hard
6070703 you have to set dreams set goals and never give up
6070704 i was swimming next to her and she beat me and she has one leg
6070705 when i take my leg off and im completely free in the water
6070706 i find it hard and im a completely able bodied person
6070707 sometimes you feel a bit awkward kind of asking but she told me everything she told me about the accident what happened the rehab
6070708 shes got such courage everyones insecure everyone has insecurities to kind of put that in show and be totally fine with that is totally amazing im going to go and give her a big cuddle
6070709 id even go so far as to award her a separate medal
6070710 i have enormous respect for her it is exceedingly hard just looking at these people inspires you
6070711 i want to do everything on merit this is not just a free ride
6070712 among the causes of homosexuality is a contagious demonic factor
6070713 dehumanising effects of contraception and abortion and ivf of homosexual marriages of human cloning and the vivisection of human embryos in scientific research
6070714 only by a genuine personal decision for christ and the church can someone separate himself from it
6070715 payments which are made where there is no legal liability to undp but the moral obligation justifies making such payments which are in the interest of undp
6070716 undp should be able to show compassion when addressing such cases
6070717 with the proposed amendment to its rules undp seeks to harmonize its approach with those of the other funds and programmes
6070718 undp does not expect the proposed change to result in a significant financial impact for undp over a period of time given the low number of such payments that undp has had to address to date
6070719 are part of a fledgling movement to make a firearm as common an accessory

6070721 i believe that this design paradox of low weight and large presence could be the way well define premium in the future
6070722 i am totally overwhelmed with the response we have had this year
6070723 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
6070724 its getting ugly out there the frauds bunglers liars and losers who are hurting america
6070725 now that means we just need to figure out a way to get them there
6070726 ive also asked for some additional forces on top of that for the current fight
6070727 but i would not use the term surge because i think we need a sustained presence
6070728 but its going to be much much harder to turn things around at this point
6070729 we have a cross border firing incident out of pakistan almost daily and unfortunately those arent diminishing
6070730 there are militant sanctuaries in pakistan and they operate at will
6070731 if you can go quietly negative thats what hes done i think the perception is that hes still running the positive campaign
6070732 its a pretty smart high low good cop bad cop strategy
6070733 we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment
6070734 the prices of gas are up the prices of milk are up
6070735 support george bush 95 percent of the time keep spending 10 billion a month for the war in iraq
6070736 its game on the moneys in the bank were going to have a huge financial advantage let the mccain campaign chase us around the country if they can find us
6070737 we certainly for a while were finding a lot more in mccains ads to complain about
6070738 with a partisan record that doesnt measure up barack obamas been reduced to a sucker punch strategy shirking his new type of politics in favor of a more negative campaign
6070739 they may understand that this race is a lot tougher than they originally thought it was going to be
6070740 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
6070741 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
6070742 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
6070743 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
6070744 this database is in a sense worse than a watch list
6070745 at least in the watch list scenario theres some reason why the name got on the list here the only thing a person does to come to the attention of dhs is to lawfully cross the border the theory of this data collection is track everyone just in case
6070746 new technology and systems designed to enhance border security or identify other violations of law
6070747 there was absolutely no way they should have the entire database
6070748 once you have data in a database you dont need it lends itself to unauthorized use
6070749 a person opts to go over the border their information is going to be collected and held anyway
6070750 if you dont want to go over the border you dont have to
6070751 to accomplish an agency function related to this system of records
6070752 when there exists a legitimate public interest in the disclosure of the information
6070753 hes done 40 years of service to this state getting money for the state for stuff we absolutely need hes a great man
6070754 this indictment thing you go to washington d c and if anybody can throw the first stone id like to meet them
6070755 has done so much for the state and it took time to build up the seniority to be able to do it why throw that away
6070756 theres a definite attitude of wanting a change to the point where a lot of people dont care what it is just make a change get them out we hear that on both sides of the aisle republican and democrat
6070757 we could lose this could become a blue state obama could take this state
6070758 can you imagine if sen stevens is spending the final five weeks of this campaign in a federal courthouse facing felony corruption charges and every night the news is covering it hes going to lose 2 to 1 in november
6070759 people are i dont know if disgusted is the right word but with the appearance that you can do these things and think youre going to get away with it
6070760 and the other thing is it seems like theyve all sold out for very little money and thats kind of embarrassing
6070761 if the election were held tomorrow i think ted stevens would beat me
6070762 this is what our democracys all about people go up and say i have a better dream i think i can represent the people a little bit better then the american people get to choose
6070763 what hes said is i think i have some experience i have seniority youve blessed me with that seniority and now theres more things we can do together in terms of an economic future for alaska
6070764 alaskans two years ago really began to take back the government as a people alaskans were disgusted with backroom negotiations a lack of transparency in public processes and just a lack of ethics and character in government
6070765 i cant remember a time in these 40 years that i ever refused to see an alaskan or try to solve the problems they brought to me
6070766 ive got one major problem now and that is to be reelected so i would ask each of you to stand with me now
6070767 my name is use your first name and the first initial of your last name only
6070768 i have read the syllabus for dr franeks class and i understand the expectations for this course
6070769 i didnt succeed at doing it at all its incredibly hard
6070770 i think you have to figure out some way of keeping all of those capabilities and requirements in your life in balance
6070771 i empowered myself by not staying in the thing with russell
6070772 i felt it was going to be repeating some similar patterns that id just gotten out of and it was a drag because i was crazy about him
6070773 beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it

6070777 we have a number of projects in the pipeline with eskom which we have tendered for
6070778 the price should reflect the cost of logistic materials used in building the houses
6070779 we however can not say our capacity is enough to provide the construction material needed
6070780 because of the price hike and other issues the construction of the low cost condominium houses could not be concluded within the time frame
6070781 with current expansion of capacity in the private construction sector and consultancy services the problem will be concluded soon
6070782 haier thermocool emphasises the need for after sales service and has invested a lot on this
6070783 while we recognise the gravity of the matter and the urgency and because this was not a technical committee we have decided to set up a committee to look into the issues and report back next week
6070784 if the committee recommends that the deadline stays or alternatively an extension be given then it will be up to us to accept or not to accept
6070785 as i speak with you now valco is attracting international offers of over 200 million
6070786 we bought it valco two years ago at 20 million now we are selling only part of it for 200 and in addition will be earning interest that we never had in the past
6070787 so far 700 metres have been dug including the main sewer line
6070788 we are left with 300 metres for trenches feeding the houses and about 60 metres for the main sewer line
6070789 i am impressed with the womens input who have proved they can do it like their male counterparts

6070795 workers of delta steel company are of the view that following the coming on board of ginl that their fortunes and that of the companies have improved for the better and as such have faulted the government revocation of the concession deal
6070796 there was no production of any sort we were not paid salaries for months
6070797 as soon as ginl was given the plant in a few months the plant came back to life and since then we have been making progress in areas of production even if not at maximal level and we hope that with time it would improve
6070798 i will not subscribe to anyone saying that ginl does not have the financial and technical capacity to run steel companies in nigeria like i said earlier this plant was completely down before ginl came over and within a short period they were able to rehabilitate the plant and start production
6070799 the plants are now working except one or two areas and that is either because of poor electricity supply to the company or the problem of getting iron ore

6070806 i want to assure ghanaians that the cpp will not take its eyes off gt just because parliament has approved the sale
6070807 i do not blame you for wanting someone who says they will take an interest in the company invest in it and protect your jobs that is what your government should have done these past several years my party will be very vigilant to ensure that the foreigners who are coming treat the ghanaian worker very well sale or no sale this is ghana this is our land in our own country our workers deserve the best treatment
6070808 to vodafone i say once again buyer beware know where you are know what you are buying know the people who have opposed this sale and understand our reasons for taking a contrary view i also know that when cpp comes to power it will review the whole arrangement to ensure the protection of ghanaian interest to be for warned they say is to be for armed
6070809 we are keeping our eyes and our options wide open we say to them resist the temptation to sell any more ghanaian assets
6070810 far from it being a further testimony to weakening our legislature you cannot say you believe in ghana then turn round and sell it and in the process treat the representatives of the people with contempt

6070821 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain

6070839 the dark tranquillity compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p2p networks as well as on ebay and in certain record stores is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg its very convincingly made with a century media logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but its nevertheless a bootleg its usually a better strategy to be silent about these things but as a lot of people keep mailing us asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd has started to appear on online discographies presented as a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight

6070856 the weather has not been kind to us but things are still pretty much where they should be in terms of the schedule

6070858 after that the finish coat will be put down on the whole thing
6070859 i think its going to happen sooner rather than later
6070860 all signs are pointing in that direction ive been wrong on all my predications about this so far because i thought it would happen last spring but i believe its going to happen as soon as it can
6070861 theres no question its going to happen for several reasons
6070862 a lot of economists are predicting a downturn in the economy next year and i think they are very uncomfortable with elections canadas investigation of this in out scheme also the price of oil this winter is going to leave a lot of people disgruntled
6070863 i think canadians are a little more ready but thats not whats driving this i think the conservatives have figured out this year is a better time than next year for an election and they are going to do whatever it takes to make that happen
6070864 its to point out that people like hugo chavez and countries like saudi arabia and russia have taken that money and have done things that arent in our best interest

6070871 in the coming months i hope nixon explains to the people of missouri how doling out a quarter of a million dollars in grants to naral and planned parenthood benefits the uninsured
6070872 from what the missouri republican party can see nixons plan to help the uninsured includes three steps 1 work three years to develop a health care plan with a 265 million dollar mathematical error 2 increase taxes to return us to an old failed system that was bankrupting the state and 3 reward pro abortion interest groups instead of providing funding to families in need if jay nixon is truly serious about helping uninsured missourians he should condemn his foundations decision to award these grants to pro abortion interest groups and promise missourians that it wont happen again

6070876 the federal government had a role to play and turned that over to the province in 1970 but with the onset of global warming and rising sea levels and tides i believe the national government has to become a partner again like they were in the past
6070877 based on the challenges i saw at the aboiteau repair project in cumberland county last week and knowing that the bay of fundy has the worlds highest tides i am concerned that if both governments dont reach a new partnership on repairing and strengthening our dike system soon then i suspect nova scotians will pay dearly for years to come
6070878 we all know what happened in new orleans after hurricane katrina and we dont want that to happen here
6070879 the aboiteau is just a pre cursor things to come and if we have failures in dikes and dont have the expertise and technology to fix and replace them then we could be in serious trouble
6070880 we have to create our own technology and once the assessment is done we have to decide how were going to fix the dikes
6070881 thats going a little too far i dont see the highway or the rail line being in danger

6070957 what is the secret of the popularity of the katzenjammer kids
6070958 i ask you what is the secret of the perpetual popularity of the katzenjammer kids
6070959 i imagine the kids preserve their ap peal from year to year because they express to childhood the dreams that childhood feeds upon and to maturity the dreams that were cherished in childhood but never came true because the dreams of childhood never do come true
6070960 as boys we set ourselves some goal or mark of achievement
6070961 let my own case since i know most about it illustrate the point i am trying in illustrate
6070962 i wanted to be an aeronaut or aviator as the term is now behold me shackled to a drawing board making pictures of the katzenjammer kids instead of up in the clouds soaring at heights where strange birds fly and losing all sense of motion as you do when you journey through the air
6070963 perhaps i am better able to draw child hood effectively because my own in the re spect at all events of desiring to become an airman persisted long into manhood and de sisted only in the face of overwhelming dis couragement
6070964 my first experience as an aerialist was on a roof a hipped affair such as you still see in cities where families live in houses instead of in three or four rooms nailed together and rented at three times their value as apartments
6070965 then i transferred my talents to the dumbwaiter i would pull myself up to the top of the house and turn loose thus secur ing a swift ride to the bottom of the shaft accompanied by a terrific bump again my parents became nervous and i was forced to desist then i got a glider it was great
6070966 we young chaps in philadelphia had some of the first gliders in the country
6070967 the gliders were followed by balloons those were days of real sport once the crew i trained with reached an altitude of 13 000 feet by the simple process of throw ing overboard too much sand by mistake
6070968 ballooning gliding and all the rest of it ended when i came to new york to draw the katzenjammer kids but that doesnt stop me from dreaming of the old life
6070969 the secret then of the hold on human hearts of the katzenjammer kids lies with all the fat men who want to be thin and the thin ones who want to put on weight
6070970 in other words only the cold necessity of three meals a day and a place to lay our heads down has prevented the phenomenon of a world filled to overflowing with over grown katzenjammer kids
6070971 diverse groups make better decisions if everyone in the room is the same youll have fewer arguments and worse answers diversity is a distinct competitive advantage
6070972 we knew however that we could improve the power to weight ratio with several select modifications lamborghini has its gallardo superleggera ferrari its f430 scuderia and dodge its viper acr now the corvette z06 has the clubsport package from katech performance
6070973 it was like going to a baseball convention and willie mays had just walked into the room
6070974 his accomplishments and service to scouting were well known highly regarded and everyone could see he played the game because he loved the game and he believed in the game and he was a microcosm of the game
6070975 underage drinking often leads to criminal damage assault and fear of crime for residents in areas subject to this kind of anti social behaviour
6070976 it presents a significant issue to our local community we want to send a message to those juveniles who drink in public areas that this will not be tolerated
6070977 i know however that the issues surrounding underage drinking are not just confined to the school holiday period and summer activities alone are not going to solve the problem
6070978 it is everyones responsibility to tackle the issues surrounding underage drinking and anti social behaviour
6070979 as a police service we will play our part but i call on parents community workers health and education professionals the drinks industry government and young people themselves to consider the long terms dangers of alcohol abuse and what they can do to stop the problem
6070980 after this operation ends we will continue to work with the local community schools and the health trusts to increase awareness of this issue and tackle the associated anti social behaviour that it causes
6070981 its a very emotional decision but unfortunately were all in a state thats been affected by our economy and you cant fight it youve got to work with the numbers that are given to you
6070982 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
6070983 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
6070984 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
6070985 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
6070986 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
6070987 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
6070988 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
6070989 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
6070990 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
6070991 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
6070992 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
6070993 my generation those born in the great depression or between the years 1932 40 are sometimes called the forgotten generation historys most fearsome war radically blurred our childhood now mostly retired by default we are the bridge generation between those who won wwii and their offspring the baby boomers whose indelible traits have been protest against traditions and authority their parents had built
6070994 to come to his town to find happiness with men who far outnumber women
6070995 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are such women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
6070996 if you wanna be happy for the rest of your life never make a pretty woman your wife so for my personal point of view get an ugly girl to marry you
6070997 people are upbeat about the chinese market turning around and of course hps numbers gave a good face to whats been a tough sell off for a couple of days
6070998 its always nice to see a bellwether company report solid earnings it reflects a view that even in times like these there are companies that are doing well
6070999 have signed their names to a public statement that the 21 year old drinking age is not working and specifically that it has created a culture of dangerous binge drinking on their campuses
6071000 i do not agree that lowering the drinking age would be effective at this time
6071001 as a consequence one in five of our students reports being assaulted by a drunken peer one in three reports being the subject of an unwanted sexual advance this is simply unacceptable and i do not believe that these statistics would change in the current cultural environment with a lowered drinking age
6071002 our experience as college and university presidents convinces us that twenty one is not working
6071003 how many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition
6071004 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
6071005 oh were not really proposing the age be dropped to 18 our statement just calls for an informed and dispassionate public debate
6071006 underage drinking why do adolescents drink what are the risks and how can underage drinking be prevented
6071007 locals weigh in on drinking age debate ui president says proposal wont solve the problem
6071008 you had more community in your little online church then weve had at most of the churches weve been to
6071009 my husband and i smoke and cuss at home and get looked down on when we go to church
6071010 if youre looking for a perfect church youre going to do nothing but look because there isnt one
6071011 my baby is 15 months old and all she ever did was cough shes been like that since weve been there but was never like that before we moved in
6071012 me and my 4 year old son had a consistent chest cough and my eyes were irritated and watered all the time
6071013 mold can be an irritant if you or your children have asthma the mold is a risk factor
6071014 even non allergic people will get itchy watery eyes sneezing and congestion
6071015 it was great to see such a determined performance against such a quality side
6071016 morning sickness is unknown in some more primitive societies where lifestyles are simpler more relaxed and less demanding
6071017 s lo puedo mostrarte el p rtico eres tu quien debe atravesarlo
6071018 when it comes to energy consumers are much more cost conscious
6071019 control or lack of it is a highly emotional value tied to a core american value the freedom of choice and should be leveraged in messaging
6071020 great fit for the intiman and a great fit for the entire arts community
6071021 experts estimate that if we keep on the current course 75 percent of americans will be overweight or obese by 2015
6071022 but it is clear now that while personal responsibility is an important part of the equation there are many factors beyond individual control
6071023 employees should be encouraged to engage in physical activity on their lunch hours and breaks employers have long allowed smokers to step outside for 10 minutes for a cigarette break
6071024 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals

6071135 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 an ounce
6071136 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6071137 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6071138 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6071139 whenever a process works at a lower temperature that brings energy savings and cost savings
6071140 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost
6071141 its all a bit of a sorry state of affairs and a huge disappointment after all the anticipation and build up

6071145 the lhc is a discovery machine we dont know what well find
6071146 im actually hoping we find something unexpected that does the job of the higgs
6071147 weve been debating this for 30 years and one way or another the lhc will definitively tell us how electroweak symmetry breaking occurs thats a fundamental advance
6071148 its a tough game you can only do it by statistical analysis since there are other known processes that produce events that can mimic a higgs boson signal
6071149 by itself the higgs is a very puzzling particle so there have been a lot of conjectures about some kind of new physics beyond the standard model supersymmetry has the easiest time fitting in with what we know
6071150 initially well be looking for things that are known standards to make sure that everything is working properly in 2009 we could start really looking for new things like supersymmetry
6071151 these large projects take such a long time we have to start early
6071152 weve been operating it and looking at cosmic ray particles
6071153 nature gives us these cosmic rays for free and theyre the same kinds of particles well see when the machine turns on so it enables us to check out certain aspects of the detector but were very excited to start seeing collisions from the machine
6071154 well be throwing away a lot of data so we have to make sure the triggers are working correctly
6071155 the graduate students and postdocs get to go to geneva but even the undergraduates get a chance to work in a real physics lab and be part of a major international experiment
6071156 there is a high level of interaction and camaraderie between theorists and experimentalists at ucsc which is not the case at other leading institutions
6071157 for me its valuable just in terms of being aware of whats happening on the experimental side
6071158 if nothing were found beyond what we know today that would be so radical because it would be in violation of a lot of extremely fundamental principles
6071159 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
6071160 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form

6071187 our enterprise social network solutions provide an easy to use interface along with an exceptional level of customer training and support and because of this nearly 100 of the communities weve supported since 1999 have been self sustained
6071188 but the market has made a definite shift this year and many are turning to outsourcing this function as a way to get up and running quickly our partnership with athena east ensures that our customers have a valuable alternative to in house community management with a team that is experienced in ensuring business goals are met and returns are delivered
6071189 weve researched this market carefully to find the right partner one who we could trust to provide the same level of care we provide our customers with a solution that would deliver the enterprise results they seek
6071190 to move away from the criticism cynicism and self effacing irony towards something more celebratory and empowering the time feels ripe for it
6071191 this sounds a lot like the imperial march in star wars
6071192 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6071193 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6071194 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6071195 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6071196 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6071197 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6071198 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6071199 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6071200 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6071201 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6071202 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6071203 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6071204 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6071205 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6071206 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6071207 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6071208 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6071209 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6071210 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6071211 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6071212 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6071213 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6071214 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6071215 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6071216 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6071217 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6071218 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6071219 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6071220 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6071221 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6071222 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6071223 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6071224 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6071225 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6071226 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6071227 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6071233 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6071234 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6071235 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6071236 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6071237 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6071238 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6071239 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6071240 who are open to doing something on the production side
6071241 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6071242 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans

6071284 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6071285 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6071296 earlier this summer i heard from anne lagac dowson a 20 year veteran of cbc radio who had quit her post to run for the new democratic party in a by election in the quebec riding of westmount ville marie ive known anne all my life literally she was my babysitter when i was an infant and so i was glad to hear that she was doing this amazing thing but i was even more delighted when she said that her campaign and her party were both passionate about the digital freedoms issues that i campaign on and she asked if id be willing to offer her my endorsement

6071301 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6071302 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6071303 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6071304 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6071305 it was a fairly minor crime with a fairly major consequence

6071312 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6071313 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6071314 no you all get together down at the other end

6071317 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president without knowing necessarily what hes doing
6071318 my vice president also will be a member of the executive branch
6071319 he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6071320 my vice president also will be a member of the executive branch
6071321 he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6071322 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6071323 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6071324 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6071325 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6071326 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6071327 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6071328 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6071329 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6071330 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6071331 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6071332 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6071333 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6071334 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6071335 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

6071341 the speaker of the house i most admire is tip oneill despite their differences he was able to work in a bipartisan way with president reagan to save social security this was possible because they were both willing to listen and to compromise
6071342 since ive become speaker my flagship issue has been energy security and addressing the global climate crisis
6071343 energy independence is a national security economic environmental health and moral issue
6071344 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth
6071345 any measure that reduces oil firms margins in america is likely to have the effect of diverting at least some investment to other countries and so exacerbate the shortage of fuel produced at home
6071346 america has only 1 6 percent of the worlds oil supply but we use 24 percent so drilling isnt much of a solution at all
6071347 equivalent of 30 years of current imports from saudi arabia
6071348 the planet is gods creation and we have a moral responsibility to preserve it
6071349 natural seepage from the sea floor is a much larger source of oil in american waters than is offshore drilling
6071350 america can achieve true greatness when we work together to make certain that every voice in america is a voice that will be heard

6071355 its time its time to come outside and fly youre a beautiful butterfly
6071356 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6071357 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6071358 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6071359 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6071360 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6071361 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6071362 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6071363 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6071364 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6071365 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6071366 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

6071480 cant give what you dont have pontiff recalls urges christians to stay close to holy spirit
6071481 holy father how can we live the gifts of the holy spirit in practice here in our country and in our daily lives in such a way that our relatives friends and acquaintances feel and experience his power and how can we exercise our mission as christs witnesses
6071482 that faith today is a force that is present a force that can give people the right orientation this is why there was a moment in which we truly felt the breath of the holy spirit who sweeps away prejudices who makes people understand that yes here we find what closely affects us this is the direction in which we must go and in this way we can live in this way the future unfolds
6071483 it is far more difficult in practice to perceive the action of the holy spirit
6071484 in the end it is the lord who helps us but we must be available as instruments
6071485 i would say simply no one can give what he does not personally possess in other words we cannot pass on the holy spirit effectively or make him perceptible to others unless we ourselves are close to him
6071486 within the radius of the holy spirits breath in contact with him only if we are continually touched within by the holy spirit if he dwells in us will it be possible for us to pass him on to others

6071515 am devenit fascinat de singur tatea pe care o evoca aceast situa ie i empatia pe care o sim eai imediat pentru acest personaj
6071516 am nceput cu ideea de a face din wall e o comedie dar cam la o treime din parcurs ne am dat seama c filmul este n egal m sur i o poveste de dragoste wall e este un personaj inocent copil ros care f r s vrea ajunge s aib un impact uria asupra lumii povestea filmului este de fapt despre eva personajul ei sufer cea mai mare schimbare iar filmul este n egal m sur povestea ei i povestea lui ea este un robot foarte elegant tehno sexy i cu o alur foarte futurist el este conceput doar pentru a i face treaba e ruginit murdar i ur t dar am considerat de la bun nceput c mpreun vor tr i o minunat aventur romantic
6071517 filmul este o combina ie de mai multe genuri este o poveste de dragoste un film sf o comedie o comedie romantic
6071518 c utasem elemente muzicale potrivite pentru acest film c nd am dat peste hello dolly s a nt mplat cel mai bun lucru cu putin melodia put on your sunday clothes
6071519 nu se vor ntoarce acas p n nu vor s ruta o fat
6071520 pe tot parcursul filmului wall e i dore te s se in de m n cu cineva asta a nv at el din filmul hello dolly a a i exprim oamenii afec iunea n acest film
6071521 mi am dat seama c a a este acel moment muzical din film i prezenta pe cei doi in ndu se de m n i am tiut c a a trebuia s fie
6071522 dintotdeauna am sim it cu pasiune c anima ia poate spune la fel de multe pove ti ca oricare alte forme media chiar dac n alte modalit i rareori a fost mpins n afara zonei sale de confort
6071523 am fost foarte m ndru c am contribuit la crearea filmului toy story pentru c am sim it c tonul i stilul acelui film au spart multe conven ii din mintea oamenilor i nc sunt de p rere c putem continua s for m anumite limite n acest sens chiar nainte s tiu c acest film avea s se cheme wall e am tiut c avea s fie nc un pas nainte pe drumul for rii acestor limite sunt foarte m ndru c am avut ansa s l fac i c s a ridicat la n l imea a tept rilor mele
6071524 acest robo el nva de fapt omenirea s redevin uman
6071525 n acest film nu am vrut s desen m robo i cu aspect uman cu bra e capete i ochi pe care s i punem s vorbeasc am vrut s lu m obiecte pe care n mod normal nu le ai asocia cu caracteristici umane i s vedem ce putem scoate din ele prin desen i anima ie
6071526 n wall e animatorii lucreaz cu toat m iestria lor pentru a putea transmite emo ii i g nduri complexe cu at t de pu ine cuvinte ideea este s putem transmite emo ii prin intermediul anima iei
6071527 am sim it c putem face asta prin dialoguri non tradi ionale p str nd ns integritatea personajelor
6071528 n via a real c nd personajele nu pot vorbi de exemplu un bebelu un animal de companie oamenii tind s defineasc emo iile acestora n locul lor
6071529 n wall e animatorii lucreaz cu toat m iestria lor pentru a putea transmite emo ii i g nduri complexe cu at t de pu ine cuvinte ideea este s putem transmite emo ii prin intermediul anima iei
6071530 n lumea anima iei pantomima le place cel mai mult animatorilor
6071531 am tot ncercat s i fac pe animatori s i impun ni te limite fiindc voiam s fie evident modul de construire a ma in riilor i modul cum fuseser concepute
6071532 personajele par robotice fiindc nu se ntind nu se turtesc a fost o mare ncercare pentru animatori s i dea seama cum s comunice acelea i idei totu i s lase sentimentul c ma in ria func iona n limitele impuse de design i construc ie a fost o misiune dificil i cu at t mai satisf c toare c nd cineva g sea solu ia corect
6071533 andrew a venit ntr o zi bucuros c g sise sursa de inspira ie pentru ochii lui wall e fusese la un meci de baseball i folosise un binoclu brusc i a dat seama c dac nclina u or binoclul ob inea alt imagine i transmitea alt sentiment acest binoclu a devenit unul dintre elementele cheie n desenul personajului principal
6071534 ne am dat seama c aveam nevoie de enile ca s urc m pe mormanele de gunoi de asemenea personajul trebuia s poat compacta cuburi de gunoi deci avea nevoie de un soi de m ini cu care s gesticuleze
6071535 po i transmite n moduri diferite elementele masculine i feminine din aceast lume iar noi am considerat c ea trebuia s fie fluid impecabil s aib calit i feminine atr g toare
6071536 dac mi c rile lui wall e sunt mai tradi ionale cu motoare i roti e din ate eva este un robot elegant n form ovoidal care se mi c folosind magne i fiecare cadru i compozi ie au fost atent modificate pentru a l sa ochiului o impresie pl cut ea are gra ie i elegan n mi c ri a a cum te ai a tepta s aib un robot foarte performant
6071537 fiecare plan se schimb fiecare unghi i chiar modul n care capul i se curbeaz spre spate c nd se rote te totul trebuia s arate ntr un anumit fel ca s fie conving tor totul trebuia s fie foarte foarte subtil n principiu ea este alc tuit doar din patru p r i i doi ochi care clipesc am discutat mult despre felul cum ar trebui s i mi te bra ele i am g sit mai multe pozi ii perfecte pentru a exprima diverse emo ii e uimitor c t de multe poate s exprime
6071538 cea mai mare provocare cu care ne am confruntat la acest film din punctul meu de vedere a fost design ul de produc ie i delimitarea decorurilor i mediilor
6071539 una dintre marile reu ite ale animatorilor de la pixar
6071540 este c pot s creeze filme de anima ie care au i elemente de efecte speciale sau filme de ac iune contur m lumi pe care le cre m pornind de la zero n cazul filmului wall e era esen ial ca publicul s cread n aceast lume altfel nu ar fi putut s cread c personajul nostru principal este un robot ultimul robot de pe p m nt ca urmare am conceput foarte realist decorul de pe p m nt cu multe detalii am creat aproape 10 km de peisaj urban astfel nc t oriunde s ar duce wall e tim exact unde se afl i tim sigur c lumea aceea exist n final am mai stilizat imaginile pu in pentru anima ie dar acestea sunt cele mai realiste decoruri pe care le am creat vreodat aici la pixar a fost i cea mai dificil misiune din punct de vedere artistic
6071541 un alt obiectiv al nostru cu acest film a fost s folosim culori i lumini pentru a sublinia emo iile lui wall e i a ajuta publicul s le n eleag
6071542 prima parte are o lumin romantic emo ionant iar partea a doua se refer la sterilitate ordine i cur enie fiind n antitez direct cu prima pe m sur ce filmul nainteaz ncet dar sigur introducem mai mult lumin romantic o mare parte din misiunea mea a fost s preiau toate aceste idei disparate de la departamentul artistic i s le duc p n la linia de produc ie
6071543 una dintre influen ele cele mai puternice sim ite de mine i de ntreaga echip n ceea ce prive te viziunea noastr asupra viitorului a fost arta creat pentru tomorrowland
6071544 nu era vorba despre detalii specifice ci mai degrab despre sentimente de tipul
6071545 una dintre chestiile pe care andrew i a dorit s le fac n wall e a fost s creeze un alt aspect dec t suntem obi nui i s vedem n filmele de anima ie
6071546 foarte adesea filmele de anima ie i dau sentimentul c sunt nregistrate ntr un soi de spa iu computerizat noi am vrut ca acest film s dea senza ia de film real filmat cu camere adev rate pentru care directorii de imagine s ar fi dus i ar fi filmat imaginile pe care le vedeam ne am dorit s aib elemente de fotografie i s par real mult mai dur dec t tind s fie filmele de anima ie n general n ace ti ani mul i de c nd lucrez cu ilm am cunoscut mai mul i oameni care m puteau ajuta s ob in acest lucru
6071547 the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford
6071548 i roger i dennis au lucrat la acest film oferindu ne perspectiva lor i multe idei referitoare la cum ar trebui s arate lucrurile
6071549 am adus chiar i ni te camere de filmat vechi de prin anii 1970 de la panavision asem n toare cu cele cu care am filmat filmele originale din seria star wars cu ele am filmat imaginile pentru a ob ine stilul special creat de acele lentile am inut cont de detalii tehnice cum ar fi abera ia cromatic distorsiunea i alte imperfec iuni iar tot ce am nv at am aplicat n imaginile noastre cu grafic creat de computer dennis i roger au jucat un rol esen ial n ob inerea acestor imagini de exemplu sfaturile lor referitoare la imagine lumin i compozi ie ne au ajutat s cre m peisajul p m ntean auster luminos i dur din prima parte
6071550 am explicat echipei tehnice c n lumea real c nd filmezi lentilele sunt de obicei cam la 1 metru distan de planul filmului i ob ii modific ri de perspectiv c nd panoramezi sau nclini camera oamenii au preluat asemenea informa ii i ne au oferit imagini care sem nau cu 50 la sut mai mult cu o imagine filmat rezultatul este c ai senza ia c ar fi un cameraman acolo care filmeaz nu c te afli ntr un soi de spa iu virtual unde totul este neatins exist o oarecare imperfec iune n aspectul final al filmului care i d un plus de credibilitate
6071551 am folosit camerele i tehnologia de iluminare pentru a crea sentimentul c exist o camer de filmat i o lentil care filmeaz ntreaga ac iune am folosit un fel de ecran lat i o profunzime de c mp foarte mic pentru a conferi imaginii o bog ie real pute i remarca fundaluri neclare i straturi cu textur mai pronun at n anumite cadre care aproape creeaz compozi ii ca de acuarel am folosit i multe cadre filmate din m n sau cu steady cam n special pentru secven ele din spa iu pentru a face publicul s simt c a a ceva chiar s ar putea nt mpla c avem un robot adev rat care merge printr o lume adev rat sim i c e ti martorul unei scene care se petrece cu adev rat una dintre marile inova ii pe care le am realizat cu acest film o premier absolut pentru pixar a fost c am putut s pre vizualiz m cadrele principale nainte s le film m pentru a avea o idee mult mai clar cu privire la modul cum va ar ta lumina n film n final n trecut nu aveam nicio informa ie referitoare la lumini n acest stadiu al produc iei
6071552 c nd am v zut filmul finisat am avut sentimentul c nu am mai v zut n via a mea a a ceva
6071553 m am sim it de parc l vedeam cu al i ochi
6071554 a fost dintotdeauna un vis al meu s colaborez cu tom sunt un mare fan al muzicii lui de mult fiindc e un tip extrem de original mi amintesc c i am povestit pentru prima dat de acest nou proiect n seara premiilor oscar din 2004 c nd ne aflam acolo pentru nemo i am zis c am o idee de film n care intr hello dolly i elemente sf m am ntrebat dac o s mai vorbeasc vreodat cu mine dup asta s a dovedit n final c partitura pentru hello dolly fusese compus de legendarul unchi al lui tom lionel newman deci ntr un fel totul r m nea n familie
6071555 n anima ie atmosfera se creioneaz n segmente de timp mai mici uneori n numai c teva secunde
6071556 prin partitura lui tom putea s comunice sentimentul lumii pe care o creaser m noi
6071557 exist o scen n primul act n care l urm rim pe wall e v z ndu i de rutina lui zilnic totul are un oarecare aspect ca de mecanism de ceas partitura are un ritm ca de fabric un fluierat slab ca atunci c nd fluieri n timp ce lucrezi tom reu e te ntotdeauna s g seasc adev rul acestor momente iar cu stilul lui unic de dublaje suprapuse i mixaje dup ce a nregistrat cu orchestra vine cu o palet proasp t de sunete are capacitatea real natural de a g si emo iile cele mai intime dintr o scen cred c de asta am lucrat at t de bine mpreun pentru c eu am tendin a s subliniez aspectele emo ionale ale pove tii
6071558 colaborarea cu peter a fost unul dintre cele mai grozave momente din cariera mea c nd am ajuns la finalul filmului ne am dat seama c mai trebuia s ad ug m ceva s cre m o poveste cu un sentiment global brusc mi am dat seama c peter a creat o mare parte din muzica lumii occidentale am fost sedus de ideea de a i aduce pe el i pe tom n aceea i nc pere ca s v d ce ar putea ie i tom s a dus la londra pentru un jam session cu peter i totul a fost ca un v rtej brusc aveam o melodie uluitoare compus de thomas newman i peter gabriel intitulat down to earth a fost mai presus de cele mai ndr zne e visuri ale mele versurile lui peter sunt n el tor de simple dar exact ce trebuie am fost at t de impresionat de versuri fiindc sunt inteligente i se potrivesc perfect l reprezint ntru totul pe peter gabriel i faptul c tiam c se inspir din povestea scris de mine iar eu eram cumva asociat n acest proiect m a f cut s mi ies complet din min i
6071559 seam n foarte mult cu o melodie peter gabriel dar are o conectivitate i o sensibilitate care sunt ale lui tom
6071560 tom a fost at t de inspirat de acest c ntec nc t a revenit asupra filmului i a rescris c teva momente principale pentru a include o parte din acelea i teme totul are acum un sentiment organic perfect integrat n film

6071620 now if you are going to win any battle you have to do one thing you have to make the mind run the body never let the body tell the mind what to do the body will always give up it is always tired in the morning noon and night but the body is never tired if the mind is not tired

6071625 the end state requirements are not known at programme initiation
6071626 the end state requirements are not known at programme initiation
6071627 we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to you know not having not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class theres a pervasive sense i think that this country as wealthy and powerful as we are still dont spend enough time thinking about the least of us
6071628 perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest i think after 9 11 my friends instead of telling people to go shopping or take a trip we should have told americans to join the peace corps americorps the military expand our volunteers expand what youre doing
6071629 people are starting to lose faith in the american dream
6071630 under the approach im taking if you make 150 000 or less you will see a tax cut if youre making 250 000 or more youre going to see a modest increase what i am trying to do is create a sense of balance
6071631 cannot confirm the reduction of pharmaceuticals in water with carbon filters
6071632 what you see in many states is a reaction to the lack of action at the federal level
6071633 a lot of bottled water is actually tap water so there is no assurance that what is coming from the bottle is any safer than what is coming from the tap
6071634 as mark twain once said when one has tasted watermelon he knows what the angels eat i encourage my colleagues to join me in acknowledging the wisdom of mark twain by supporting this resolution
6071635 we also recognize that we have more to do and we will do so both in the remaining weeks of this years congress and next year when we will have expanded democratic majorities in the house and the senate working with president barack obama
6071636 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
6071637 resolutions are fine but why arent we also passing legislation to lower gas prices what about health care reform and runaway entitlement spending
6071638 not only do you create heat stroke awareness month every year after that you recognize the importance of heat stroke awareness month you never move on to substantive legislation
6071639 wicket cricket baseball football cat fives or any other game or games with balls
6071640 even back in 1791 youths were already breaking windows playing americas favorite national pastime
6071641 with that the first mention of baseball was penned into history
6071642 despite a slight chilling effect the types of events you can hold really hasnt changed very much
6071643 its just a question of adhering to the new guidance
6071644 the truth is the ethics changes havent affected our parties very much
6071645 we want to showcase our fine products and be 100 within the rules and the law
6071646 if those parties prove to be a problem then we can revisit it when we do the ethics rules next year
6071647 due to the very late end to the primary season
6071648 had the effect of making people more thoughtful and more careful
6071649 but at the end of the day the application and interpretation of those rules may allow a fairly significant amount of entertainment at most of these events

6071661 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 an ounce
6071662 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6071663 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6071664 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6071665 whenever a process works at a lower temperature that brings energy savings and cost savings
6071666 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost
6071667 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
6071668 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
6071669 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
6071670 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well
6071671 one of the great advantages of a regional dialect is that its rooted in real life and real distinctions like the one between i could and i might could each with a different degree of probability to sacrifice such shades of meaning for no better reason than a false respectability is to lose sight of what language ought to be about conveying meaning precisely even about imprecision
6071672 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
6071673 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
6071674 weve had russian strategic aviation challenging in ways they havent even along our borders with the united states which i might note is a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider this is not one that is cost free
6071675 that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world
6071676 georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt georgias economy will be reinforced
6071677 we are going to send a message that we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures like georgia and ukraine
6071678 europe will be divided again the lines are different pushed farther east but the division is the same and dangerous
6071679 you cannot conduct foreign policy based on fear of russia weve been through this before ukraine knows it the baltic republics know it
6071680 i dont think russia is an immediate threat to us in the military sense but they are a nasty neighbor
6071681 an alliance with the united states is a long term investment
6071682 poland by deploying the interceptors is exposing itself to a strike 100
6071683 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
6071684 i am not afraid of an invasion and i hate the russians
6071685 that empire is very aggressive but we count on the word of the united states we will be safe because the u s supports us
6071686 only the u s can protect us not europe and so there is no danger for poland
6071687 one battery of patriots will provide no security for warsaw there are lots of threats and not enough privileges
6071688 unfortunately no matter the outcome of this trial this schedule alone may not be enough to ensure that senator stevens has the ability to compete meaningfully in the upcoming election
6071689 were venue transferred to alaska senator stevens would have the opportunity to campaign in the evenings and on weekends during the trial
6071690 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
6071691 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
6071692 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
6071693 dead zones were once rare now theyre commonplace there are more of them in more places
6071694 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time
6071695 keep fertilisers on the land and out of the sea
6071696 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields scientists and farmers need to continue working together to minimise the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
6071697 we believe it would be unrealistic to return to pre industrial levels of nutrient input to oceans but an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century
6071698 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
6071699 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
6071700 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
6071701 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
6071702 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
6071703 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
6071704 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
6071705 the stakes for wilmington clinton county this region and our entire state are very high
6071706 the wilmington air park is a priceless asset right here quietly nestled in this community is the largest privately owned airport in the united states
6071707 this is not a republican issue or a democrat issue
6071708 this is about the people of this community and how we can work together to deal with this situation and save jobs
6071709 this is not just a company moving out but its a ripping out of the community
6071710 we saw this day coming when we heard the news from dhl on may 28
6071711 working with dhl we have been able to offer many of our employees a fair and meaningful severance package
6071712 the dhl family and i personally deeply regret that this unavoidable and irreversible decision will cause severe hardships to many families in wilmington and ohio
6071713 my colleagues and i will do our best to be of help
6071714 had no choice but to enter into the settlement in order to avoid further incarceration
6071715 if this stands this single handedly undermines the entire civil judicial process in this country
6071716 there is not a shred of evidence that he doesnt qualify
6071717 would harm all companies developing experimental drugs by providing a precedent for using the courts to gain special treatment instead of participating in controlled clinical trials
6071718 it could have given them some reason to believe that when the time came she would be able to get them into a program

6071724 i am deeply troubled by this matter and understand how devastating the announcement of it is to the brazilian community
6071725 we cant really take much out of what happened today
6071726 theres still about a 60 percent probability of a rate cut happening in january of 2009
6071727 manny has accomplished so much for the state of new york over the past 18 months
6071728 in his role as deputy secretary of education manny worked tirelessly to demand greater education accountability and provide meaningful reform
6071729 in the process he oversaw the greatest infusion of education aid that our state has ever seen manny has had a long and successful career serving new york states students after devoting so much of his life to public service i wish him the best in his future endeavors in the private sector
6071730 the opportunity to serve as the senior education policy adviser in two executive administrations has been a tremendous experience
6071731 i am especially appreciative of governor patersons support and commitment to improving public schools and to the children of this state i intend to continue to serve students in new york and nationally in a new role within the private sector
6071732 i was gone no more than two minutes and then this happens
6071733 were just waiting and hoping the little one pulls through
6071734 when the victim is a small child the cowardly behavior of the person responsible is all the more alarming
6071735 we were playing just before he went outside with his cousin
6071736 but then we realize were never going to see her again shes never going to show up again its just like a big hole
6071737 we know that there are people who have valuable information so we ask individuals to look deep into their hearts and help us bring the person responsible for this horrible and senseless act to justice
6071738 with a few words and a smile she could bring a whole room together thats just the kind of girl she was
6071739 we will never forget her but my main concern is i would never want another parent to feel what im feeling right now
6071740 theres about a 2 foot in diameter tree about 80 feet high and the wind just took it down
6071741 there are about six branches sticking into the living area
6071742 these storms were moving pretty quickly so it probably didnt last more than a few minutes
6071743 i love you be strong because soon we are going to be together again
6071744 she told him if he messes this up that she would make sure he would not be able to see him again
6071745 the boy kicked the ball down the side of brightwood terrace and gonzalez cursed the boy in spanish
6071746 what we are trying to accomplish is at the end of the day that there is something left for the family members
6071747 its what you want to know are you going to get out of the hospital or not
6071748 we were humbled by suboptimal performance and took that as an opportunity to excel
6071749 it validates all the hard work weve been doing it validates all the systemic changes
6071750 i think it is the case that after the public reporting of the cardiac surgery situation at umass memorial their performance improved thats indisputable
6071751 ill be looking to talk to a lot of people to get input to get into look learn listen mode before i start to set a course
6071752 an injustice to the unique character of the holocaust as well as to the memories of its victims
6071753 our concern has never been as much with the person who holds the position as with the policy of the adl
6071754 the ball is in their court at this point and were waiting for them to do the right thing
6071755 got his eyes wide open and he knows what his challenges will be
6071756 my guess is he will try to build bridges and do everything that he can to get adl back on the footing it once had in the community
6071757 it is a big job and its an important job and he has big shoes to fill
6071758 im thrilled that they brought in somebody of derreks caliber and experience but who is comparatively untested in executive leadership
6071759 they took a chance on derrek but i think its exactly the kind of risk taking that will pay off in days to come
6071760 i was born over here my parents were born over there
6071761 were not different in any way nothing separates us i just dont see why they cant have my rights and my opportunities
6071762 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
6071763 we believe our labeling will be even more detailed to allow consumers to make the best possible choice
6071764 unless all of the companies use the same method theres little point to the exercise
6071765 most people dont know what the term carbon footprint really means
6071766 but we hope this will be a launch pad for other companies to take part and increase public awareness
6071767 i am sick amp tired of the president of the united states embarrassing me
6071768 none of them are a statement that i would be comfortable making right now at this point in my life
6071769 how do you bring a project into compliance after the fact without bringing other proposals back into the fold

6071774 momma if people watching were an olympic sport you would get the gold medal
6071775 that northward shift in the storm track is tied to reduced early spring precipitation especially over the southwest u s
6071776 it looks like the northern great plains seem to get a little bit more rain
6071777 the dry season in parts of the country that are already quite arid
6071778 the change so far in total precipitation is pretty small
6071779 we expect that this may continue or even get worse
6071780 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought
6071781 as an artworks its nice but as a poster its horrible text is hard to read hence the poster does not serve its purpose to inform about the event nicely chosen typography would do better in this case
6071782 when we mourn our workers we dont go to work at all and we will not go to work at the mine on thursday how that may or may not affect their output is not our concern
6071783 hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world large and small use these servers as the foundation of their it infrastructure because they are exceptionally secure and reliable
6071784 we do one thing as well as anyone in the world
6071785 we seamlessly and securely link merchant credit card purchases to order entry systems our clients are brick and mortar merchants mail order and call center operations and online vendors adorama of course fits each those categories
6071786 merchants work hard to make the purchase easy and stress free so that the customer does not give up before checkout but its just as important to make this experience secure and to protect both parties these authenticated payment options do just that
6071787 we couldnt be happier with the solution both mastercard and visa have lowered our costs per transaction as an incentive to take part in their authenticated payment programs
6071788 in addition we estimate these programs have reduced fraudulent online purchases by more than five percent our overall payback period was under five months
6071789 adorama has benefited from a team of first rate specialists spanning transaction security services payment software and computer hardware the team has delivered an integrated suite of state of the art card processing tools that are practical and cost effective for everyone from small shops and online merchants to huge web vendors

6071800 floods in the cuu long river delta happen every year so people are used to taking preventive measures for crops and life
6071801 in the past floods caused problem to transportation and it was hard for children to come to school but in recent years vietnam has built protective dykes and residential areas above the flood peaking level
6071802 since the floods are to wash away alum we expect the yield of the next winter spring rice crop to be good at least on par with this year
6071803 floods are forecast to rise above the average level in many years

6071836 the opening of the redbridge centre could not have happened at a better time this being londons summer of cycling
6071837 one of my key ambitions as mayor is to see london become a real cycling city by encouraging the estimated 1 1 million londoners who own bikes but dont use them regularly to get back in the saddle
6071838 so now theres no excuse because its a superb facility and if you dont own a bike theyll lend you one just turn up and pedal

6071861 right from the start we were looking for an efficient monitoring solution to cover the entire warehouse
6071862 staff are a major factor in the handling of package freight
6071863 shortage of time and the usual warehouse pressures will inevitably mean that some units for shipment are not located
6071864 video monitoring combined with a precise real time location system covering the entire warehouse is therefore absolutely essential
6071865 it used to take us several hours to search through video tapes in order to track the route and locate the position of the shipment in the warehouse thanks to real time location this takes just a few minutes
6071866 this has reduced the number of errors to a minimum and greatly increased the quality of our service a happy side effect has been the way in which the system has considerably improved staff morale whereas searches used to be both time consuming and irritating the rapid query resolution now possible thanks to the process transparency of real time location enable every member of staff to remain quite relaxed we have achieved everything possible in packaged freight regarding process security and distribution quality our logistical processes work and we have realised an roi in much less than 12 months

6071877 is she pestered by stage door johnnies in tweed caps who ply her with guinness and fish and chips
6071878 she could leave bradford disillusioned with men and hitch hike her way to london
6071879 then she sees an ad for a model agency the job turns out to be a seedy dress warehouse in the east end
6071880 on second thoughts no rats we want this to appeal to women too
6071881 then i see her being chased around racks of twenty nine and six sunfrocks
6071882 nice touch then the dirty old sod collapses with a heart attack just as hes closing in for the kill

6071987 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s

6072034 growing old most feel is better than the alternative but although some of us will age gracefully some surely will not advances in medical care dont always help and treatment can be expensive and have debilitating side effects some doctors are now proposing that their patients consider whats being called slow medicine that is trying to let nature take its course rather than aggressively fighting the ravages that sometimes accompany old age

6072040 a man wont steal ordinarily unless that which he steals is something he cannot as easily get without stealing in liberty the cost of stealing would involve greater difficulties than producing and consequently he would not be apt to steal

6072055 understanding of and knowledge about muslim prisoners was particularly weak and there was insufficient management scrutiny of race issues in general
6072056 these include prisoners who are dangerous but also prisoners who are vulnerable
6072057 inspectors found that there was no evidence of a robust violence reduction strategy which is essential to ensure safety order and control there was little management analysis of data on bullying intimidation or self harm
6072058 high security prisons require constant and vigorous management in order safely to contain and work effectively with their challenging populations
6072059 franklands population had become even more challenging recently with increases in gang affiliations and the arrival of a small number of convicted terrorists
6072060 it is unfortunate that this coincided with the absence of the governor for some months and the resulting drift that was observable at this inspection needs urgently to be reversed
6072061 i am pleased that the chief inspector has acknowledged the excellent multidisciplinary relationships within the dspd unit which deals with some of the most challenging prisoners in the system
6072062 i am concerned about the comments raised on the safety within frankland however this should be seen in the context of franklands extremely challenging population
6072063 a new diversity and safer prisons manager is now in post to ensure a focus on the matters raised by the inspector in relation to anti bullying and diversity
6072064 anne owers is warning of drift in key areas particularly safety
6072065 i feel that i can achieve that sort of thing a loan would only make me a better player like jay has been since he came back hopefully i can make those steps as well
6072066 i was really disappointed not to make it on the flight to the training camp in austria
6072067 when i saw the list and i wasnt on it it was upsetting but thats football
6072068 since then i have put so much effort into training and the games so that i can prove to the boss that i can be a success here hopefully he will see that i am trying to improve everything in my game that i can play football his way and work hard for the team with or without the ball
6072069 in the last few games not just huddersfield where barazite grabbed the winner but also for the reserves i have been practicing my role for the whole team working off the ball
6072070 he has been doing his job for 22 years and i cant think of anyone in the game who can match that when you have that kind of experience you become very good at your job and gary is undoubtedly a fantastic physio
6072071 well see him fairly frequently especially as part of his remit is to monitor the fitness of the best young english in the country and we have a fair few of them
6072072 if id never run on a pitch before id probably be nervous but ive done it loads of times alongside gary in first team games and on my own in reserve matches to be honest you dont really notice the crowd as you are so involved with whats happening on the pitch
6072073 on matchdays now ill be the only physio travelling but i will have two masseurs with me and of course doctor beasley who the fans will have seen in the technical area and on the pitch occasionally

6072075 the beauty of rockstacking is working with objects that are entirely different from each other and seeing the beauty in each and discovering how they work well together
6072076 it will continue to be a great sport there was softball before the olympics so theres softball after the olympics hopefully it will get back in it has a good chance
6072077 its a bittersweet moment because with the youth of our team the next one would have been the big one
6072078 the group of young ladies on this team staying around for four years that would have been an easy call staying around for eight years there are going to be some people who will have to think about it
6072079 i will ask them to stay because theyre great athletes and theyre not done yet but at the same time its an absolute shame
6072080 i think this will be it for me i have to make that decision ill make it a little later
6072081 we didnt have the best tournament but we came in here and i thought we played pretty well
6072082 i feel like we are definitely capable of a medal and we didnt play our best ball here
6072083 it could have gone the other way but i hung some balls today
6072084 we hit line drives after line drives after line drives and nothing fell
6072085 we know we should be standing on the podium but unfortunately the results dont show that
6072086 its a tough loss for us but the good thing is that the team has done a lot for this country and the sport of softball and we can only look forward to whats going on next
6072087 even though we dont get the medal around our neck to kind of validate what this group of ladies is all about certainly putting some runs up on the board and showing we had a lot of fight that does mean something
6072088 theyre disappointed because they fought hard and it wasnt enough
6072089 if you look at the two games today one goes into extra innings and one goes back and forth and those are the type of games that you want to be in an olympic championship
6072090 youve got the best athletes out there its a clean sport its a womens sport and its a team sport i think there are a whole lot of checkmarks that should go beside softball as far as it getting back in i dont get a vote but i certainly will push for one

6072101 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6072102 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6072103 this is just the tip of the iceberg im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
6072104 the effect on grapefruit juice on some medicines is well established and where this applies it is clearly detailed in patient information leaflets
6072105 pharmacists will usually draw this matter to patients attention when dispensing their medicines this new research showing that apple and orange juice may enhance or reduce the effects of some medicines is interesting but it is only one study
6072106 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet

6072108 literally if you look at this board its quite interesting
6072109 its all based on the votes and how they placed in the voting and has pretty much nothing to do with financial and geographical flow which is traditionally what we think of in monopoly

6072121 who knows how many more involved a desperate seller and a lender who accepted a short sale
6072122 many would be buyers especially those eyeing costlier coastal homes wait for signs of a market bottom or for the return of more favorable financing

6072221 there is a strong case for the reserve bank to move by a larger amount by 0 5 particularly given that at the beginning of a rate cut cycle its best to have your biggest move because thats when its safest because thats when rates are at their highest

6072249 do you love playing sports outdoors or staying indoors reading
6072250 its clearly a time where you have to get big or get out
6072251 we dont get any gas from bgs acquisition of origin if they get it
6072252 they dont get any of our acquisition of sunshine if we get it
6072253 there has been a disconnect between the underlying asset value and the trading share prices because investors have been sceptical about the underlying value
6072254 yeah im doin the drywall up there at the new mcdonalds
6072255 theres no question we did the right thing in holding the opening ceremony to air in prime time on nbc that night
6072256 im really doing something with my life i have a job and its an official one too because see i have these business cards as validation
6072257 we have to do an official vote this is still a straw poll
6072258 okay this is an official vote i think i think this is the official vote
6072259 yeah i was a sourpuss but i didnt want to hug sissy or go upside down or jump in the puddle
6072260 we dont put shoes in our mouth and we dont lick the toilet
6072261 she did enjoy it she said it was really good apart from getting lost a few times
6072262 she enjoyed meeting new people and already has lots of new friends in her class
6072263 she is exhausted though because she tried to walk it it was just a bit far for her so it looks like ill be her driver for a little while
6072264 shes still attending clinic every fortnight but everything is going well
6072265 we play nice football pass the ball about well but we are missing that killer touch to see teams off
6072266 its a results driven business and we know that but if we keep plugging away im sure things will turn our way
6072267 going into every game we play im confident we can win it and if the rest of the players have that mentality then we will pick ourselves up
6072268 we dont want to be sitting at the bottom of the table and at least a play off place is our aim for the season
6072269 in our last few games we have played well and its disappointing when things dont go your way
6072270 against raith in the cup we were on top for long stages of the game and we deserved to win the game but we lost out on penalties
6072271 and against east stirling last week we were excellent it was one of those games that i really enjoyed playing in because we played so well but we couldnt put the ball in the net and lost 1 0
6072272 we are dominating teams but its not just down to the strikers to do a job we have lost some sloppy goals and maybe the midfield arent creating enough chances its collective responsibility at the end of the day we win as a team and we lose as a team
6072273 its one two three strikes and youll be happy at the old ball game
6072274 a subcommittee will consider and make a decision on board changes as part of our response to corporate governance issues that have previously been raised and management changes in the context of our announced strategic review
6072275 the overwhelming influence on perpetual in the past year has been the state of the markets
6072276 australian investors experienced their worst returns in about a generation
6072277 the outlook for the global market and the us is not exactly rosy
6072278 they are improving margins in all businesses even in new zealand and indonesia where you could have expected an impact from economic slowdowns
6072279 they probably spent way too much time trying to fix korea and its clear they have now focused on existing operations
6072280 we are delighted that customer research and ovums evaluation have placed us among the top three vendors of applications outsourcing a clear reflection of our flexible client driven approach
6072281 as our clients business ally eds takes nearly 50 years of outsourcing experience and tailors applications strategies that effectively let clients do what they do best manage their business

6072287 this report is the first chief social work officer annual report prepared for the council under the councils change management programme service and people first
6072288 there is no doubt that further improvements in service delivery are required such as increased personalisation of services earlier interventions improving the quality of residential provision and support to carers
6072289 social work services in north lanarkshire will continue to be delivered within the context of a changing and challenging environment
6072290 for example the shift away from institutional forms of care towards highly personalised individually designed services aimed at supporting people to remain in or return to their own homes and communities is just one of the areas this council is pioneering
6072291 real progress has been made in assisting the most vulnerable people in our communities and in the way we deliver our services
6072292 as the consultation period begins to draw to a close it is vital that local people have the opportunity to express how they feel about their post office and the impact that closure would bring
6072293 i will ensure that all the ward councillors and the local msp are invited to what i hope will be a constructive meeting mr khan the sub post master has specifically requested that there is not a political fight over the future of his post office
6072294 it is important to continue the strong community campaign which has already started and anyone who would seek to grandstand and turn it into a party political football should remember the need to act constructively
6072295 constructive input from local communities is important changes are going to take place in the post office network it is essential these are made with the benefit of local customer feedback to help minimise inconvenience and disruption
6072296 the decision to close the post office is absolutely appalling i have written to the mp and fully expect a reply
6072297 quite simply this is a facility that must be kept open
6072298 this post office is used by a great number of elderly people who quite clearly are going to find it difficult getting to the main street where the post office is quite frankly not user friendly
6072299 in the past i have seen queues almost around the block at 8 30am waiting to get in
6072300 we at coltness community council have a deep interest in both the schools
6072301 coltness community council and the community as a whole have a deep affection for both schools but for me it is the logical answer
6072302 but this is just one stage it is the right decision all the relevant factors point to coltness primary
6072303 the next stage of the debate is whether we are getting a new build primary or a refurbishment
6072304 coltness community council and both sides of the divide both believe that if this is a decision being made then every parent wants a new school not a refurbishment regardless of where it is
6072305 before the recommendations were put to the committee an extensive consultation process took place
6072306 this involved parents parent councils school staff unions community groups msps mps and councillors being asked to comment on the proposals public meetings were held and over 400 written responses to the consultation were received
6072307 the main conclusions from the consultation are that there is general acceptance of the amalgamation in principle the most important reservations are that each school community wish a new build as opposed to a refurbished school and the location to be their own site
6072308 todays decision will see the preferred site of coltness primary being investigated further
6072309 it is also recommended that the new build option from a best value perspective is explored fully with the schools and centres 21 framework contractor and further consultation will take place as plans are developed for the delivery of this exciting education project
6072310 todays decision marks the first step in delivering improvements to the education and community facilities available through the amalgamation of coltness and lammermoor primary schools
6072311 one of the main reasons for the amalgamation is the over provision of non denominational primary school places in coltness and lammermoor
6072312 i would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the councils commitment to working closely with the relevant parties involved throughout the process of this exciting change and confirm they will play a key role in shaping the future of the school
6072313 i would advise that the council noted that the summary justice reform programme included the unification of the administration of the sheriff and justice of the peace courts under the control of the scottish court service
6072314 further as a result the rutherglen district court which was within the sheriffdom of glasgow and strathkelvin would transfer to the scottish court service in december 2008
6072315 the council noted that after carrying our various scoping exercises the scottish court service consultative document contained a proposal to cease the operation of the district court in rutherglen from december 2008 and transfer all of its business to the new justice of the peace court in glasgow
6072316 the council carefully considered all the information contained in the document however the council considers that rutherglen court service be retained in rutherglen as this court provides a local justice service with justices who have a better understanding of the local area
6072317 to ensure this element of local knowledge be continued the lay court should be retained at rutherglen
6072318 i felt we possibly went into the blantyre game with a false confidence after beating east kilbride
6072319 blantyre battled well for everything they gave our keeper a few things to do but we had five or six chances ourselves without making their keeper work for it
6072320 i dont think the game was drab as both teams worked very hard and played some decent football it was just one of those nights for both
6072321 we huffed and puffed throughout the entire game our play in the final third was a disapointment as we were shooting when we should have passed and vice versa
6072322 but you cant take anything away from blantyre who could have nicked it themselves
6072323 we probably had over 60 per cent of the possession but couldnt turn that into goals
6072324 although we didnt take full points we had to take some satisfaction as we collected another clean sheet
6072325 we were sloppy throughout the entire team during the first 30 minutes or so
6072326 we tried out a new 3 1 4 2 formation but it wasnt working for us and myself and assistant manager tam miller take full responsibility for that so we changed things to a 4 4 2 after about 15 minutes when it was obvious it wasnt working
6072327 vale took the lead after about 20 mins with a cracking strike
6072328 we werent happy so on the half hour we brought graham doak on after taking off odonnell and pushed craig ferguson into midfeld
6072329 once wed got our formation and personnel changed we looked the better team once we had our balance back
6072330 this steadied the ship and we came right into the game after that we got an equaliser after about 40 minutes with a great move and finish by chris queen from an acute angle at the back post
6072331 craig fergusons goal came after a melee in the 18 yard box when he got a knock on from a corner
6072332 a few strong words were used at half time as we tried to get it right telling them to up their effort we wanted to see more hunger from them we wanted to see an improvement in the quality of movement and passing as well as their movement off the ball and they reacted well
6072333 we could have scored several goals but it wasnt to be but at least we were creating the chances we could have gone in 3 0 down at half time but in the second half we could have scored half a dozen
6072334 there were a lot of good performances from the entire team but whats very satisfying is that this year unlike last year or the season before is the fact that on the bench i can look round and see players who can go on and change the game
6072335 we had another four players on saturday who werent even stripped to play so were gradually getting there you can tell a teams quality by the strength of the bench

6072339 personally i think they will be there or thereabouts at the end of season so i would rather get a decent start in the league
6072340 obviously the fans want to go on a wee cup run but promotion has always been mine and willies ultimate aim
6072341 we have a squad that is good enough i believe we are stronger than last year with more variety but time will tell of we actually manage it this year
6072342 we played well certainly a lot better than we did against vale of clyde and we want to stay at that level of performance
6072343 the size of the park suits us better with the way we are trying to play football we are trying to build a team that will pass the ball
6072344 of course it will make it easier for other teams as well but i think that suits us as well and i reckon the supporters will see quite a few entertaining games this year
6072345 its important for us to get people onto the park and hopefully we will be ready on it for saturday if you want to win promotion you need home victories so this was a good start
6072346 we spoke about the defence at the end of the game and it is a problem at the moment
6072347 we are looking great everywhere else but the fact is we look vulnerable from anything pumped into our box and thats extremely disappointing with the players we have
6072348 its quite simple if they cant do it then we will bring in someone else they have another couple of weeks tops to get their fingers out were not manning the panic station yet but something needs to improve we have got numerous defenders so someone has to step up to the plate
6072349 weve got enough football players in midfield and attack in defence we need a couple of guys who will just defend
6072350 there are no excuses for them at the moment they need to take more pride in keeping a clean sheet
6072351 the game was finished at 4 0 but we spoke to them at half time and said we werent bothered about more goals but we wanted to focus on the defence before the game as well we spoke about good habits and keeping clean sheets is one
6072352 those with aspergers syndrome have normal scores on iq tests and are of average or above average intelligence you should know that normal means a score above 70 you create the impression that those with as are all very bright this is not so incidentally current research suggests that there are good reasons for not differentiating between autism and aspergers syndrome

6072388 it is whites who are abusing our african american children and these statistics clearly show the racism our culture endures
6072389 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
6072390 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

6072423 the convergence of usually different muslim or christian or muslim and christian groups should be in principle a source of happiness and comfort for lebanon since it helps us prove to the whole world that there is still a large space for dialogue and accepting the other and it shows readiness for cooperation between the lebanese citizens

6072427 im happy to transfer net reflector to red gate for continued development
6072428 red gate has lots of experience with similar projects and can put a full development team at work to move the tool forward
6072429 red gate developers use net reflector all the time and we have the highest respect for what lutz and the add in writers have done
6072430 this is one of those rare tools that is very easy to use and works the way it should our commitment is to maintain an amazing free tool that will continue to benefit the community while seeking input from users on ways to make net reflector even more valuable
6072431 dad what are you asking me for im only six years old i dont know anything about how the world works
6072432 the good news is its consistent the higher your vitamin d status the lower the risk of your developing a hip fracture
6072433 we conclude that low serum vitamin d concentrations are associated with an increased risk for hip fracture in community dwelling women the mechanism of association is unclear
6072434 if you dont have inadequate vitamin d you cannot efficiently absorb calcium
6072435 vitamin d also helps maintain bone health by keeping bone cells active
6072436 to get vitamin d levels to where they need to be to reduce the risk of hip fracture you need to be taking at least 1 000 international units of vitamin d a day from a supplement
6072437 they need to ask their doctor for the right test
6072438 women should strive to keep your vitamin d levels above 125 nanomoles per liter year round to do that they are going to require supplements
6072439 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
6072440 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
6072441 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment
6072442 if you lose weight after diagnosis you can achieve some long term benefits in terms of blood pressure and glycemic control that extend even beyond the point at which you regain weight
6072443 we havent had results like this before this is telling us that with a significant mean weight loss of 10 7 kilograms 23 5 pounds in 18 months theres an improvement despite weight regain after 36 months
6072444 its entirely possible that one of the explanations here is that if we looked at 15 years we wouldnt find that benefit continuing
6072445 losing weight is a good idea even if you regain it
6072446 we do ask that those diabetics who are overweight lose weight and that in general improves all the factors that affect vascular disease and thats blood pressure blood sugar and cholesterol
6072447 were pretty happy that we came up with rather realistic tumor sizes although this is a very basic model it should give researchers a tool to use when deciding if a particular secreted protein would be a good biomarker
6072448 early cancer detection is a very challenging but important goal for the cancer field this modeling work enables a very deep understanding of the problems that will have to be solved for blood based cancer biomarkers to be successful in this effort
6072449 this technique is really the first time that cancer surgeons can see structures that are otherwise invisible providing true image guided surgery if were able to see cancer we have a chance of curing it

6072452 w hen i read the newspaper articles about the hazelwood case i just got angry because it seemed we had spent the last three or four years trying to reform education and produce kids that were more creative and independent and capable of thinking critically it seemed that all this effort to make students more thoughtful and independent would now be swept under the rug by a supreme court that wanted to muzzle everybody
6072453 my experience in the two week intensive advisers training at kent state was one of the most enjoyable and enlightening experiences of my life

6072456 sisyphus has his rock and i have my school newspaper
6072457 despite all good intentions i consistently find myself with a paper that has been created from the ether because if i try to focus too hard on the writers of the articles they disappear like fey children and i am left with a wispy bit of gossamer for a publication
6072458 asne reynolds institute not only provided me with the materials to stop that rock but gave me the lead to ground fey folk
6072459 my paper literally has been created in an off hand casual way as something cute for students to do i will return with the fire in my belly and covered in copy ink with a declaration that this has ended and there will be serious journalism at my school from now on

6072469 zaheer did the job for us as he bowled in right areas credit also goes to badrinath as he had not played sri lankan spinners ajantha mendis and muttiah muralitharan before
6072470 we needed this victory there was pressure on us especially after losing opener gautam gambhir stiff neck before the match we would have liked to win comfortably but in the end it is about winning
6072471 we knew we could win this match only by getting wickets we tried hard but dhoni and badrinath batted really well and their partnership took the game away from us
6072472 the important thing was to be consistent and bowl in right areas
6072473 as a spearhead of the attack it was important for me to provide early breakthroughs all the bowlers did well and kept pressure on their batsmen

6072482 we respect the salafists choice of freezing the memorandum of understanding for more discussions and revisions they will find hizbullah is always by their side in any decision they find appropriate
6072483 all of the positive support to the hizbullah salafist mou revealed its importance in enhancing dialogue between different islamic and national forces and in facing challenges
6072484 the agreement will be temporarily frozen pending appropriate circumstances that allow for its implementation

6072523 port development combined with the rail development is holding the bay trail hostage if we cant move forward with that issue its unfortunate because its a good opportunity
6072524 there is really nothing stopping the bay trail except some government to get the money to do the project its just a matter of getting those people together into some force to get the money and get it done
6072525 touch diamond owners will know that the navi wheel on the front of the device is capacitive and can measure movement without actually rotating like many htc devices it seems the touch diamond and pro have hidden features and pretty tasty ones indeed using an application called this video shows not only is the navi wheel capacitive but that the whole front of the device can track finger movements and even two fingers independently so far there is no know feature on the touch diamond pro that exploits this but once our developers get their hands on the api it wont be too long this also promises that even current generation devices with resistive screens will be able to take advantage of multi touch features in wm7

6072555 es wird f r den strache die partei in der zukunft einfach nicht mehr f hrbar sein wenn jeder sagt okay lieber strache wenn ihr glaubts ihr k nnts mit mir schlittenfahren dann geh ich halt zum original haider und stadler damit hat er ein weiteres strukturelles problem
6072556 wenn man sich anschaut dass er selbst vor dem parteivorstand erkl rt dass er ohne kickl keine politik machen kann das gibt er ja offen zu wenn man wei wie fremdbestimmt er ist dass ihm praktisch jeder satz vor einem ffentlichen auftritt vorformuliert vorgekaut wird wenn man das alles mal gesehen hat dann darf ich ihnen sagen dass

6072603 we have many months of hard work ahead with educational partners to get this initiative off the ground the industry as a whole needs to make it easier for motivated young talent to gain experience in using todays industry standard middleware technology these games are much more complex to develop for and this is a pro active approach to prevent an industry shortage of experienced mmog developers particularly game programmers and game designers
6072604 i am pleased to have the opportunity to work with leading game educators to provide them with the resources to create mmogs and virtual worlds the technology that will be made available will greatly enhance educators and students understanding of what commercial grade mmog engines are about and also provide students with greater job prospects in this online age

6072610 cindy seems like shes laid back and not trying to run her husband
6072611 its nice to have a brain but they should let their husband be president
6072612 michelle obamas african american shes highly articulate shes young and she seems highly devoted to her husband and her family
6072613 she serves as a role model theres not a parent on planet earth who wouldnt want a daughter like this
6072614 polls show that some people dont like michelle obama dont know who cindy mccain is
6072615 we can be president as long as nobody finds out about that chick he banged
6072616 thats great jackass but as far as i am concerned i dont know about this the first time i find out will be when i read it in the papers
6072617 blah blah he banged her blah blah she knew wait what
6072618 the developer wanted to make the game the most realistic volleyball video game out there
6072619 theyve worked really hard to make sure they captured the true heart and passion of the court in this game they wanted players to feel like they are really in the game bumping setting and spiking

6072627 every pharmacist has the right to do the same thing

6072634 almost 100 percent of the oil companies are constrained in their investment program because there is no rig available
6072635 todays students and young professionals must be willing to go global not only get to the top but to compete successfully in the international marketplace
6072636 you must be a top performer this is a substantial investment for companies and they dont send mediocre people
6072637 the past advantage of college graduates in the job market is eroding ever more students attend college at the same time as ever more employers are automating and sending offshore ever more professional jobs and hiring part time workers
6072638 unacceptable numbers of college graduates enter the workforce without the skills employers say they need in an economy in which as the truism holds correctly knowledge matters more than ever
6072639 i think if youre remarkable amazing or just plain spectacular you probably shouldnt have a resume at all how about three extraordinary letters of recommendation from people the employer knows or respects or a sophisticated project they can see or touch or a reputation that precedes you or a blog that is so compelling and insightful that they have no choice but to follow up
6072640 how do you win a war that is militarily unwinnable
6072641 obviously pulling out would be the worst of all outcomes but the solution can only be political even if that requires military supremacy the courage of soldiers demands the intelligence of politicians
6072642 even though the toll is so high you should be proud of what you are doing
6072643 theres been wide consensus for a long time in france that when the right times come the army must be used even if the price to pay for that will be the loss of soldiers
6072644 once the shock of these deaths eases people wont ask whether we can stand the losses we obviously can nor will it be whether this is a legitimate and important war for global stability it is debate will focus on how we get down to business and map out a way to beat an enemy that is very clearly getting stronger
6072645 i think that the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
6072646 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet
6072647 to turn each of those states into a daunting porcupine capable of deterring the russian bear
6072648 i think one area of us military spending that will definitely get bolstered by the russian invasion of georgia is spending on strategic defense meaning defenses against nuclear weapons
6072649 most us missile defense efforts over the last 20 years have been focused on countries like north korea that may now change
6072650 the us decision to pull troops out of europe was based on a belief that russia had become democratic and peaceful
6072651 many policymakers in washington will now be rethinking whether that will be prudent or not
6072652 is a signal that all is not well and russia is making choices that people think will take them down a very nasty road
6072653 and make sure we have hedges that position us to respond appropriately as necessary
6072654 but i dont think were at the point where we upend all our planning assumptions and put this new threat front and center
6072655 maybe ill look back on this with a little regret how close can you be one place but what can you do i tried hard but i havent made it a metre off the final against the best americans and jamaicans so i cant be too disappointed i didnt mess up
6072656 ive clearly improved this season come on another level maybe these olympics came a year too early but its been a good championship for me i knew 20 25 would probably make it and it did from both semi finals
6072657 i just didnt have that extra gear but considering my problems in the past with rounds ive still done really well
6072658 i always felt it would be a six horse race between the four that qualified and me and chris williams i beat williams but not the other four
6072659 this was a class up again compared to the quarter final i think for most of the race i was just a touch down a tiny tiny fraction i was fifth off the bend when i hoped to be fourth then tightened up i still think i got my peaking right but im just not as strong as these guys not yet and this is the olympics the best sprinters in the world
6072660 and hopefully i can move on as well and at the world championships next summer make the final but i was absolutely loving it out there had a great time i said id enjoy every minute of it because it doesnt come around every often and even after the race i looked up at the crowd took it all in there are 91 000 people in there but you dont get a chance to see them until you finish
6072661 athletics is such a huge sport and im such a huge fan and want to see it getting bigger and better in ireland one way to do that is perform on the big stage and hopes that carries on through to the grassroots
6072662 what do you do and how did you get to where you are today
6072663 on august 16 the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the searching for bigfoot team
6072664 the ice was being thawed slowly and the following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed i extracted some from the alleged corpse examined it and had some concerns
6072665 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area
6072666 as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6072667 later that day we were informed that mr whitton and mr dyer had admitted it was a costume

6072681 i dont want to have anything to do with it
6072682 this is a wake up call to get people to think about their actions and what life really means
6072683 try swimming a lot and youll look like me at least from the neck down
6072684 in principle yes i must repeat we will never be perfect
6072685 it could be i should have pushed it more at the very beginning
6072686 its not up to me to impose a solution however the technical committees will get clear orders to find a solution
6072687 the b panel scoring is where theyre not getting that separation theyve got to find way to separate them
6072688 mike ignore all emails about the new coloring its awesome pursue it
6072689 is it real is it real did i really win gold
6072690 i wanted to make china proud in the olympics that china is hosting
6072691 in the first leg i felt the gold was already in my pocket because i was first and the chinese girl was behind
6072692 in the end i turned around on the last leg and realized that maybe spain had given up
6072693 i knew if i kept passing one after another victory would be mine
6072694 this is probably the most stressful 10 days of my life
6072695 ik hou van schrijven deze woorden uit de bedankingswoorden van het boek womens ministry in the local church blijven me inspireren en motiveren schrijven is zoete gemeenschap met de heer hij onderwijst me wanneer ik schrijf als niemand het ooit leest dan is zijn doel toch bereikt in mijn eigen ziel ik ben voldaan als het hem behaagt om het te gebruiken in de levens van anderen mag zijn naam dan verheerlijkt worden

6072700 to shoot 65 to do it makes it that much better i feel really good about the way ive been playing
6072701 i had some moments of greatness mixed in with some pretty awful shots
6072702 that was the hard part im not saying that match play is easy but i just feel more comfortable knowing i can take a deep breath and validate my game
6072703 it just means were starting to do things in the right way
6072704 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done its good but still theres a long ways to go its just nice to be there right now
6072705 i dont think weve played particularly bad in any of these games but tonight was one bad inning
6072706 we set the table for them and cracked it open further with an error and those guys capped it off with a hit we just didnt get it done late weve been doing a terrific job of that but not tonight
6072707 weve been pitching well its just at the end we cracked the door for them and let them win
6072708 its frustrating because we didnt play well enough certainly in the eighth inning theres not much more you can say about it
6072709 no really now you actually have to go to bed

6072713 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
6072714 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects on which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species

6072729 de zonde leeft vermomd daarom is het zo moeilijk ze te herkennen het feit dat de zonde er zo goed uitziet is een van de dingen die het zo erg maken om zijn boze werk te kunnen doen moet ze zichzelf voordoen als allesbehalve verkeerd leven in een gevallen wereld is als het ultieme gemaskerd bal bezoeken

6072736 ik ga minder naar de kerk maar mijn geloof is overeind gebleven hoe ik dat beleef hou ik voor mezelf als je ouder wordt word je je er meer van bewust dat het leven kort is dat er veel problemen in de wereld zijn en dat je dankbaar moet zijn dat je hier nu op dit terras kunt zitten als je je eens minder goed in je vel voelt denk je daaraan ik weet ook op wie ik kan rekenen op mijn familie en mijn beste vrienden ik weet wie voor mij belangrijk is en zij weten dat ook dat is mooi

6072740 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought
6072741 that northward shift in the storm track is tied to reduced early spring precipitation especially over the southwest u s
6072742 it looks like the northern great plains seem to get a little bit more rain
6072743 the dry season in parts of the country that are already quite arid
6072744 the change so far in total precipitation is pretty small
6072745 we expect that this may continue or even get worse
6072746 if one started to use biofuels and in reality that policy led to an increase in greenhouse gases rather than a decrease that would obviously be insane

6072749 kerkpraktijk in belgi boert verder achteruit de kerkpraktijk in ons land gaat er verder op achteruit zo blijkt uit een studie van het centrum voor politicologie van de kuleuven in opdracht van de belgische bisschoppenconferentie zo werd in 2006 nog 56 8 procent van alle borelingen gedoopt tegenover 64 7 procent in 1998 in deze periode daalde het aantal kerkelijke huwelijken van 49 2 tot 26 7 procent en het aantal kerkelijke begrafenissen van 76 6 tot 61 procent naar schatting 7 procent woont wekelijks nog een mis bij tegenover 11 procent in 1998 volgens de leuvense onderzoekers zet de secularisering zich op hetzelfde tempo door als dat de jongste decennia het geval was wel blijven er grote verschillen tussen de gewesten de kerkpraktijk blijft in vlaanderen het hoogst en het laagst in het brussels hoofdstedelijk gewest de breuklijn situeert zich echter veeleer tussen stad en platteland terwijl in de plattelandsgemeenten soms nog cijfers tot 90 procent gehaald worden ligt de kerkpraktijk bijzonder laag in het centrum van brussel volgens de onderzoekers blijft de katholieke kerk in ons land evenwel bijzonder sterk ingeplant ze verwijzen hierbij naar het feit dat 2 procent van de bevolking of 200 000 mensen als vrijwilliger meewerkt aan het parochiale verenigingsleven
6072750 as a pastor i know that you can learn a lot about a mans character based on how he treats his family
6072751 barack is a strong man of christian faith who has been married to his wife michelle for 16 years
6072752 what they describe in the ad could describe millions of american men
6072753 just go to a promise keepers event and the stadiums full of them but that doesnt mean all of those men are qualified to be president the question i would think that religious leaders would be asking is what is this mans views on issues whats his christian worldview on issues
6072754 i dont think that most pastors in this country those who believe the bible is the word of god and interpret that through what we know is a traditional christian worldview are going to be able to just close their eyes to the radical pro abortion position of senator obama
6072755 this is a man who has pledged to sign a freedom of choice act that would overturn every pro life law state local national in the nation
6072756 the school district has decided to turn course after we filed the lawsuit
6072757 weve gotten one thing that we were looking for and that is that the church is allowed to distribute their awana flyers on the same terms as everybody else
6072758 the bigger problem with this is that the school has policies that expressly discriminate against religious speech and religious speakers

6072762 its great to be a finalist for the science to service award we hear from our program participants and their families that they love what we are doing and now we have the opportunity to receive the same recognition at the national level this type of recognition not only speaks to the star program itself but also to all of the dedicated instructors and community members who strive to provide high quality after school programming in the mid coast without their hard work and support we wouldnt be in the place we are today
6072763 it is very rewarding to be able to provide clear evidence that what we are doing works to positively impact the predictors of problem adolescent behaviors before children develop them being a finalist for a national level award is like icing on the cake we have the satisfaction of knowing we are making good things happen in our community and are getting recognized for our work too
6072764 in this four hour tape that we listened to they were talking about specifics of changing judges recruiting new judges in these type s of situations rewriting constitutions
6072765 they have sued the bush administration they have sued countries around the world they are a vicious group of pro abortion litigators
6072766 theyre supported by the ford foundation the rockefeller foundation the hewlett foundation the packard foundation george soros and on and on and on and on and the united nations population fund which by the way claims its neutral on abortion yet they fund this pro abortion litigating group

6072771 those firms merrill wachovia and others are going to have to raise that cash
6072772 they are either going to have to get it from the federal reserve through some direct or indirect means which means more leverage more fed balance sheet more regularly oversight or theyre going to have to get it in the capital markets
6072773 the price in the federal reserve is about 2 plus percent in the capital markets its four times as high
6072774 if they pay the higher price there is no profitability for them so their franchises are jeopardised this is a serious developing issue as we cure years of overleveraging
6072775 that was exactly what i wanted from the first round
6072776 i felt real good instead of sitting back i allowed myself to get in the hunt when i got the lead i wanted to shut it off but i had to reaccelerate im glad i had to do it because it shows i had that kick

6072778 to have insured nearly a half million people in less than two years is nothing short of remarkable
6072779 the significant reduction in free care through the health safety net provides further evidence that health care reform is having its intended effect
6072780 these newest enrollment numbers show that the multi pronged effort to insure people through the expansion of medicaid publicly subsidized insurance and the individual mandate is working
6072781 we appreciate the efforts of all parties but will need to ensure that we can sustain the effort going forward
6072782 these new enrollment numbers show our continued hard work to implement the historic health care reform is undeniably working
6072783 we must stay vigilant to ensure that as more people obtain insurance our costs are controlled and quality remains among the highest in the world with all those things working in the same direction our efforts will continue to be a model for the rest of the country
6072784 this report is good news and provides further evidence that health care reform is working in massachusetts
6072785 the latest enrollment numbers including an increase in private group coverage and a drop in the free care pool demonstrate that expansion and coverage are not being paid for solely by the state our public private shared responsibility is an effective partnership and with the new cost containment law passed this year health care reform will move forward with even greater sustainability
6072786 this remarkable increase in health coverage for massachusetts residents demonstrates irrefutably the continued success of health reform and shared responsibility
6072787 the dual findings of 439 000 newly insured and a 41 decrease in healthy safety net payments confirms that people are moving out of emergency care and into coverage we applaud the ongoing efforts of the administration to keep health reform moving forward

6072799 this is a really exciting project for ladbrokes bingo and we are delighted to be bringing bingo on such a big scale to the streets of liverpool
6072800 we wanted to represent the fun exciting nature of the game and were sure the giant bingo balls will make an impact on both merseyside and across the country

6072809 the fdas assessment relies on just two studies which were funded by the american chemistry council acc this ignores dozens of other studies done by independent scientists which have found evidence of health consequences
6072810 the chemical industrys efforts to hide or misrepresent the hazards of its product have been so blatant that congress has felt the need to intervene
6072811 the federal governments failure to prevent harm for american citizens is unacceptable when will government learn to err on the side of caution instead of risk equations
6072812 we are not exactly where we want to be at this stage of the season
6072813 lewis moody will be out for a few months erinle is probably going to be out for another six weeks and louis deacon is struggling with his back he will probably be out for two to three months we have sent him for new scans we are a little bit worried about that
6072814 castrogiovanni is also going to be out for another two months and martin corry has a groin injury but is progressing quite well
6072815 harry ellis is still struggling with his knee whenever he trains there is still swelling in the knee so i am concerned about that
6072816 hipkiss is not 100 per cent and is struggling with a groin and geordan murphy has had a scope on his knee we are a little bit thin and there are lots of guys struggling
6072817 but its good that we had a look at the academy kids in biarritz to see what depth there was and i was impressed with what i saw i am happy with the fitness and conditioning of the guys too the skill levels were good in biarritz and we scored some good tries
6072818 for 50 minutes we were organised and played within the structure we had talked about our 9 0 lead could have been grown out even further but we then made two or three silly errors missed a tackle here and there and our reaction to that was panicky
6072819 we had to try and create things we had not worked on and when you do that in france you get picked off for 50 minutes it was pleasing but there can be no excuses for mistakes whether you are a youngster in this environment for the first time or an experienced international
6072820 when you play for gloucester it is about operating at a high level consistently and in that respect we should have been more competitive
6072821 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
6072822 i remember seeing nastia for the first time when the scores came up and she said finally and she hugged me
6072823 to finish off on my last routine of this whole olympics experience and to finish it with a gold in my favorite event i cant stop smiling
6072824 chow doesnt really put things into words hes very professional and he holds things in his emotions
6072825 but i could tell by his actions by the way he hugged me by the look on his face that he was more proud and happy than he ever has been
6072826 ill use the same word ive used all along this is surreal
6072827 i went big i told myself go big or go home i knew i wouldnt have a chance to medal with my other routine because ive done that routine the best i can in team finals and gotten a 15 7 that would have put me fourth i added a couple of skills put my start value up five tenths and if i had stuck that landing this would be a different color medal
6072828 it pretty much went silent in the gym every time i went up there
6072829 people were saying is he really throwing this stuff right now people know im not afraid to go crazy
6072830 we crossed off another day yesterday and said wow this is the last day of our olympic competition and we need to really enjoy it
6072831 i was proud that shawn finally got a gold medal and we can both say were olympic champions thats pretty cool
6072832 separating the ownership of gatwick and heathrow makes a great deal of sense
6072833 it will put pressure on heathrows owner baa to get its act together
6072834 deliver our ambitious investment program to expand airport capacity build new facilities and provide a better service to passengers and airlines
6072835 its just a matter of seeing it believing it and just working at it and achieving it the guy who went 0 1 at the world championship just won the olympic title
6072836 its unclear if this will be the first time obama appears with his running mate
6072837 the mystery of who that running mate will be has created a media frenzy with rampant speculation does it mean anything that obama today praised the national security leadership qualities of one senator in his speech to veterans
6072838 im proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional one billion dollars in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
6072839 remains shrouded in secrecy leaving him the option of making known his selection at any point this week some campaign insiders are known to favor
6072840 was troubleshooting in georgia over the weekend but was back home today in wilmington trying to deflect attention
6072841 used the word he to describe his choice rather than the phrase he or she which would appear to exclude potential female running mates such as sen hillary clinton of new york and kansas gov kathleen sebelius
6072842 is reportedly sounding out republicans about the viability of a pro abortion rights running mate fueling speculation that hes considering connecticut senator joe lieberman or former pennsylvania governor tom ridge
6072843 multiple gop sources say that party officials in washington and in the states have been contacted by the mccain campaign in the past two weeks and asked about the fallout
6072844 sources at the republican national committee now say theyve been told by mccains aides that the former pennsylvania governor tom ridge is no longer being considered mccain aides flatly refused to comment
6072845 slipped further down mccains list yesterday as evangelicals remained deeply opposed to the pro choice republican
6072846 sources say mccain is seriously considering a registered democrat joe lieberman the right wing is threatening a revolt
6072847 youre going to have a lot of conservatives throwing up their hands and saying this is a ticket we cant support
6072848 in several states are in a frenzy over how to persuade
6072849 flew to georgia on tuesday as emissaries of sen john mccain to stand in solidarity with its leaders against russian military aggression
6072850 to stop questioning his patriotism because he wants to withdraw troops from iraq
6072851 responded sharply to mccain who had spoken to the groups annual convention monday in orlando
6072852 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6072853 john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that
6072854 in response the mccain campaign reiterated its argument that obama lacked experience in foreign affairs
6072855 painted during the democratic primary as weak on abortion rights
6072856 is now being portrayed by opponents of abortion as an extremist who literally supports killing babies both portraits are based on his handling of a related issue in the illinois senate and obama insists they distort his position
6072857 and his critics agree that as chairman of the health and human services committee in the state legislature in 2003 he led efforts to defeat a bill called the born alive infants protection act but they disagree about virtually every other aspect of the legislation from its meaning and purpose to the breadth of its application
6072858 narrative of the presidential campaign appeared to be set on the issue of abortion
6072859 altered since the rev rick warrens saddleback civil forum in california on saturday
6072860 hesitant statement at the forum that defining the beginning of life is above my pay grade took even some supporters by surprise since then the national right to life committee has challenged him on an obscure law that protects babies born alive after failed abortions saying that his opposition to the measure in the illinois state legislature proves he is an extremist
6072861 at the forum seemed to hearten many conservatives not only because of his firm uncompromising stand against abortion but his broader appeals on global warming genocide and the embrace of causes greater than self
6072862 on the biggest backdrop he could find an oil rig more than 100 miles out in the gulf of mexico
6072863 platform of chevrons genesis production facility which produces about 10 000 barrels of oil a day
6072864 it is time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6072865 the elaborately staged photo op represents something of a turnaround for mccains campaign which only a few weeks ago seemed dogged by an interminable spell of bad luck his first attempt at the oil rig visit was postponed after a huge oil spill in the mississippi river in new orleans
6072866 called the four hour excursion nothing more than a stunt
6072867 modest outcome of the emergency meeting reflected divisions within the alliance over responding to the russian invasion
6072868 some european powers such as germany have favored restraint anxious not to aggravate the crisis and jeopardize their energy supplies from russia
6072869 former soviet bloc governments have advocated a tougher stance anxious to deter the kremlin from believing that it can reimpose its influence over its former empire
6072870 struggled to come up with concrete steps to force a defiant moscow to end its 11 day occupation of its smaller neighbor even as russian troops seized prisoners and u s military humvees
6072871 failed to agree on any specific punitive measures despite pressure from the united states that nato at least threaten russia with unspecified consequences and pleas from the czech republic poland and natos baltic members that it take a tough stand
6072872 empty words thats how moscow glibly dismissed natos criticism yesterday of russias continued occupation of georgia the russians may be bullies but like all bullies they know weakness when they see it
6072873 what happened in brussels today was appalling the nato statement was embarrassing it deplored russian actions which it said were inconsistent with peacekeeping no kidding you invade a neighbor and its not peacekeeping remarkable thats what you would expect out of old europe somebody owes the former secretary of defense an apology
6072874 backed by the united states and european powers pleaded for the un security council to demand that russia immediately withdraw its troops from its small neighbor
6072875 remains defiant despite efforts by both nato and the un security council to defuse and resolve this crisis

que abrirlo sin remedio meter en el saco lo que contenga y luego lo vender en el zoco de los caldereros sac el cuchillo y empez a maniobrar hasta que levant el plomo entonces sacudi el jarr n queriendo inclinarlo para verter el contenido en el suelo pero nada sali del vaso aparte de una humareda que subi hasta lo azul del cielo y se extendi por la superficie de la tierra y el pescador no volv a de su asombro una vez que hubo salido todo el humo comenz a condensarse en torbellinos y al fin se convirti en un efrit cuya frente llegaba a las nubes mientras sus pies se hund an en el polvo la cabeza del efrit era como una c pula sus manos semejaban rastrillos sus piernas eran m stiles su boca una caverna sus dientes piedras su nariz una alcarraza sus ojos dos antorchas y su cabellera aparec a revuelta y empolvada al ver a este efrit el pescador qued mudo de espanto tembl ndole las carnes encajados los dientes la boca seca y los ojos se le cegaron a la luz cuando vio al pescador el efrit dijo no hay m s dios que alah y soleim n es el profeta de alah y dirigi ndose hacia el pescador prosigui de este modo oh t gran soleim n profeta de alah no me mates te obedecer siempre y nunca me rebelar contra tus mandatos entonces exclam el pescador oh gigante audaz y rebelde t te atreves a decir que soleim n es el profeta de alah soleim n muri hace mil ochocientos a os y nosotros estamos al fin de los tiempos pero qu historia vienes a contarme cu l es el motivo de que estuvieras en este jarr n entonces el efrit dijo no hay m s dios que alah pero permite oh pescador que te anuncie una buena noticia y el pescador repuso qu noticia es esa y contest el efrit tu muerte vas a morir ahora mismo y de la manera m s terrible y replic el pescador oh jefe de los efrits mereces por esa noticia que el cielo te retire su ayuda pueda l alejarte de nosotros pero por qu deseas mi muerte qu hice para merecerla te he sacado de esa vasija te he salvado de una larga permanencia en el mar y te he tra do a la tierra entonces el efrit dijo piensa y elige la especie de muerte que prefieras morir s del modo que gustes y el pescador dijo cu l es mi crimen para merecer tal castigo y respondi el efrit oye mi historia pescador y el pescador dijo habla y abrevia tu relato porque de impaciente que se halla mi alma se me est saliendo por el pie y dijo el efrit sabe que yo soy un efrit rebelde me rebel contra soleim n hijo de daud mi nombre es sakhr el genni y soleim n envi hacia m a su visir assef hijo de barkhia que me cogi a pesar de mi resistencia y me llev a manos de soleim n y mi nariz en aquel momento se puso bien humilde al verme soleim n hizo su conjuro a alah y me mand que abrazase su religi n y me sometiese a su obediencia pero yo me negu entonces mand traer ese jarr n me aprision en l y lo sell con plomo imprimiendo el nombre del alt simo despu s orden a los efrits fieles que me llevaran en hombros y me arrojasen en medio del mar permanec cien a os en el fondo del agua y dec a de todo coraz n enriquecer eternamente al que logre libertarme pero pasaron los cien a os y nadie me libert durante los otros cien a os me dec a descubrir y dar los tesoros de la tierra a quien me liberte pero nadie me libr y pasaron cuatrocientos a os y me dije conceder tres cosas a quien me liberte y nadie me libr tampoco entonces terriblemente encolerizado dije con toda el alma ahora matar a quien me libre pero le dejar antes elegir concedi ndole la clase de muerte que prefiera entonces t oh pescador viniste a librarme y por eso te permito que escojas la clase de muerte el pescador al o r estas palabras del efrit dijo por alah que la oportunidad es prodigiosa y hab a de ser yo quien te libertase ind ltame efrit que alah te recompensar en cambio si me matas buscar quien te haga perecer entonces el efrit le dijo pero si yo quiero matarte es precisamente porque me has libertado y el pescador le contest oh jeique de los efrits as es como devuelves el mal por el bien a fe que no miente el proverbio y recit estos versos quieres probar la amargura e las cosas s bueno y servicial los malvados desconocen la gratitud pru balo si quieres y t suerte ser la de la pobre magir madre de amer pero el efrit le dijo ya hemos hablado bastante sabe que sin remedio te he de matar entonces pens el pescador yo no soy m s que un hombre y l un efrit pero alah me ha dado una raz n bien despierta acudir a una astucia para perderlo ver hasta d nde llega su malicia y entonces dijo al efrit has decidido realmente mi muerte y el efrit contest no lo dudes entonces dijo por el nombre del alt simo que est grabado en sello de soleim n te conjuro a que respondas con verdad a mi pregunta cuando el efrit oy el nombre del alt simo respondi muy conmovido pregunta que yo contestar la verdad entonces dijo el pescador c mo has podido entrar por entero en este jarr n donde apenas cabe tu pie o tu mano el efrit dijo dudas acaso de ello el pescador respondi efectivamente no lo creer jam s mientras no vea con mis propios ojos que te metes en l en este momento de su narraci n schehrazada vio aparecer la ma ana y se call discretamente

6073218 8 20 cia evidence not supporting iraq attack so bushies create their own intel agency
6073219 ms hobart was different than other teachers in a good way
6073220 we didnt learn just from a textbook we experienced the topics by jumping into the textbook we got to construct a rainforest in our classroom have a fancy lunch on the queen elizabeth ii and go on a safari through africa what i learned ten years ago still sticks with me today when i become a teacher i hope to inspire my students as much as she inspired hers
6073221 its anybodys guess but traditionally bad economies have been good for the fair
6073222 our biggest year ever was 2001 just after the tech bubble burst
6073223 when times feel tough people sometimes stay closer to home
6073224 maybe this will be the last big hurrah of summer for all those people who didnt drive very far on vacation this year because of the gas prices
6073225 lots of times when its extra crowded it seems like people get hot and tired and go home earlier so they dont buy as much
6073226 those who normally take long trips might be staying in the state this year
6073227 and no matter what the economy and his family has seen it all at the fair from the boom times to the depression and back people still need some entertainment
6073228 you wont see helmets and nightsticks but were prepared for any situation
6073229 wow i cant believe thats me i love the photos

6073233 im happy to transfer net reflector to red gate for continued development
6073234 red gate has lots of experience with similar projects and can put a full development team at work to move the tool forward
6073235 red gate developers use net reflector all the time and we have the highest respect for what lutz and the add in writers have done
6073236 this is one of those rare tools that is very easy to use and works the way it should our commitment is to maintain an amazing free tool that will continue to benefit the community while seeking input from users on ways to make net reflector even more valuable
6073237 we are pleased the university is pursuing an agreement that would make these records publicly available
6073238 the donors only concerns regarding the collection are due to personnel information that could include names confidential salary information and even social security numbers
6073239 if one started to use biofuels and in reality that policy led to an increase in greenhouse gases rather than a decrease that would obviously be insane
6073240 the other night when my fianc e came back home he found me in the leather bodice 4
6073241 no matter how good of shape im in i cant run
6073242 becka those are the most beautifully dipped easter eggs i have ever seen
6073243 i wanted to thank you for getting that extra money for us
6073244 you could have cheated us and we would have been none the wiser
6073245 dont push me ill pull you instead and if you push too hard ill pull away
6073246 shoot the elephant in the room before he breaks all the furniture

6073248 there is no question for us that we would wind up in the top two which in the end is what matters
6073249 the majority of voters in this district made it clear they want a change in this country
6073250 i expect its going to be chaotic in here today
6073251 i woke up and was surprised the storm wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
6073252 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6073253 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6073254 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6073255 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6073256 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
6073257 i expect its going to be chaotic in here today

6073264 to put these results into perspective during the 2004 campaign i received just 34 percent of the vote in the primary
6073265 fewer than half of the voters who will vote in november cast their ballots in the primary
6073266 in all four corners of the state including places where she didnt do very well last time around
6073267 we expect the margin to be growing in the next couple of days
6073268 validated the work ive done on issues like methamphetamine domestic violence identity theft and mortgage fraud
6073269 were ready to go maybe the media and the public will start paying more attention to mckennas record
6073270 im very pleased and grateful to the people of the state of washington for returning me to the high court for another six years
6073271 with todays launch american airlines makes history as the first and only u s airline to offer customers full in flight internet connectivity demonstrating once again our industry leadership and focus on our customers
6073272 when we use drugs you have to use it at the right dose too low a dose doesnt give you the effect you want too high a dose has the chance of producing too much of an effect or just basic toxicity
6073273 so if you want to get the most chance of having the most consistent uniform effect what you should really do is take your medication with a whole glass of water on an empty stomach
6073274 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6073275 there cannot be a dividing line across europe as there was in the time of the cold war
6073276 the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take
6073277 as long as russian forces are occupying a part of georgia i cannot see a russia nato council convening
6073278 russia has made it pretty clear its not that anxious to improve co operation with nato so if nato suspends talks thats unlikely to have much leverage
6073279 the view from russia is that international law and international organizations such as nato are transient phenomena of the late 20th century
6073280 what really counts as far as moscow is concerned is big powerful states using their muscle with gas and tanks
6073281 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6073282 the reason we went to five year contracts initially was because our bargaining unit contracts initially were three year contracts and it seemed like every time we turned around we were negotiating contracts with our bargaining units that takes attorney time that takes staff time that takes employee time its very labor intensive
6073283 do marginal benefits outweigh the marginal costs attracting and retaining a good police chief is an important thing is it worth a 2 year contract compared to offering a 5 year contract
6073284 years ago performance of major league baseball players was based on the length of their contracts
6073285 while i would be willing to review evidence that a 5 year contract is more useful than a 3 year one with an option to extend my gut tells me a 5 year contract could dull the pencil dull what otherwise would be a much sharper edge compare that with what the state of michigan mandates of food contractors in public schools the contractors are allowed only a short term initial contract with 1 year extensions food service companies go to school districts so confident of their ability to please that they give the school districts a 30 day out clause

6073298 a number of guys have received interest from nfl teams which is a part of having great players and winning a championship
6073299 im happy to get him another shot at the nfl we feel hes come a long way in the past two years as a professional and we wish the best for him
6073300 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
6073301 legislators probably felt impelled to appear as if they are doing something even if it really does nothing
6073302 mientras los valores de la hacienda en pie no se actualizaron los costos aumentan
6073303 no es que los peones cobren demasiado sino que el ternero es barato
6073304 tanto argentina como grecia son dos grandes equipos grecia es una selecci n que tiene jugadores de muy buen nivel europeo y nosotros tambi n somos buenos
6073305 europe faces a stark choice between either embracing the evolving forest biotechnology or becoming unnecessarily dependent upon the rest of the world for timber pulp and paper product with little consideration given to europes values and preferences
6073306 without gm tools european society would also be denied the benefits of establishing new longer rotation forests including spruce pine and fir on abandoned agricultural land to increase carbon sequestration and contribute to environmental remediation
6073307 once pulp fibre or tree metabolites can be produced more cheaply or at higher quality in competitor countries such as china malaysia india canada the us and chile the european forest sector would be diminished this trend would threaten millions of jobs currently worth billions within the eu alone the european timber trade deficit could only increase in these circumstances weakening europes competitive position in the forest sector in this way would adversely affect trade deficits lead to substantial job losses
6073308 the experiment was to see if less chemicals could be used and we were able to do that we showed they stood up fine no different to wild ones when we put them into a pilot scale we got good quality paper but with less chemicals we proved that a company could save money on chemicals
6073309 this is the real tragedy of the attacks on the field trials because it actually prevented us accumulating the knowledge of just how useful they could be i cant see any justification for interfering with field trials
6073310 were still only doing the research but there are huge varieties in the amount of lignin present in the wild population you can do something in the laboratory or the greenhouse and everything can look fine but until you put them out under controlled conditions of course you really cant tell how theyll cope
6073311 the whole area has had such a bad press that it would be a real bonus to find an example where they could show a conservation benefit to make people stop and think again that it could be beneficial rather than the entrenched positions almost knee jerk responses that some of the conservation groups have come out with
6073312 its a real tragedy because its a technology that should work absolutely hand in hand with organic agriculture its a way of protecting plants and crops without resorting to chemicals
6073313 its got to be a more environmentally friendly way of dealing with problems i think attitudes will change theyll have to change as we wake up to our environmental problems it means deploying any or all technologies
6073314 in other parts of the world people really are pursuing it much more actively than we are at the moment if these trees do offer benefits we will be left behind
6073315 in america a lot more going on a lot of paper companies are interested and now with the bio energy push theres going to be a lot more interest in manipulating plant cell walls and materials
6073316 if australia and japan really do produce new trees that are easier to process and more economical they will capture a greater share of the market and europe will be left behind
6073317 it wont be able to deploy the technology quickly because even if japan or australia has a new tree it probably wouldnt fit the european climate if we got left behind it wouldnt be possible to recover quickly
6073318 there was no communications person so i ended up doing the pr and events
6073319 i really want to bring out new artists and things people have never seen before
6073320 i like working with charysse because shes very honest and on the ball and shes someone who gets a lot of people out when you have a show or event

6073326 i am totally overwhelmed with the response we have had this year

6073332 theres no credible evidence that whats in airborne can prevent colds or protect you from a germy environment
6073333 airborne is basically on overpriced run of the mill vitamin pill thats been cleverly but deceptively marketed
6073334 boosts the immune system with seven herbal extracts and a proprietary blend of vitamins electrolytes amino acids and antioxidants
6073335 the manufacture distribution and use of it equipment is responsible for around 2 of total global carbon emissions thats on a par with the airline industry
6073336 as an it company cobweb believes it has a responsibility to lead the way by reducing our own environmental impact and by working with our customers we can achieve even more that is what our new green community is about collective action that makes a difference
6073337 with over one third of it departments likely to have one or more environmental criteria in their top six buying criteria in 2010 it makes good business sense too
6073338 as a hosted it services provider cobweb works hard to keep our environmental impact to a minimum we also help our customers to reduce their own environmental footprint by reducing the need to maintain energy hungry servers on their premises
6073339 we were extremely pleased to receive our iso 14001 accreditation but we do not intend to rest on our laurels we will continue to look at reducing our own carbon footprint and encouraging our customers to join us in a variety of green community initiatives

6073354 you the most beautiful woman i ever seen even on media
6073355 about 50 such personnel who had come to bjp office here had narrated their woes about how they faced threats in the valley in recent past and were forced to quit different parts of the valley
6073356 they should learn from the people of jammu who have proved their secular credentials by ensuring that no kashmiri muslim working in jammu leaves for valley under duress or threat
6073357 we warn these officers including the chief secretary the director general of police and director agricultural to desist from such pressure tactics or else they and their families will face social boycott from jammuites

6073364 one thing i told three of the firms lawyers early was that suing the county was definitely off the table
6073365 there was a miscommunication here nobody told me that had they done so we would not have gone forward with the notice of claim
6073366 we dont contemplate ever instituting a lawsuit against the county because we feel they did nothing wrong

6073368 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6073369 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6073370 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6073371 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6073372 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6073373 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations
6073374 can i think of any other film festival that has invited as many indian films year after year

6073558 the bible does not address the matter of appropriate behaviour for those who are for whatever reason homosexual by instinct or nature
6073559 by the end of the 80s i had definitely come to the conclusion that scripture was not dealing with the predicament of persons whom we should recognise as homosexual by nature

6073566 not part of christ but the whole christ and not a partial or local unity but the full eschatological unity of all in christ
6073567 any structure which would deny the fact that each eucharistic community revealed in a certain place the whole christ and the ultimate eschatological unity of all in him
6073568 no provincialism that would fail to see the same reality in the other eucharistic communities
6073569 is neither an objective gift to be possessed nor an objective order to be fulfilled but rather a presence a presence which unites into a single existential reality both what is given and what is demanded the presence of him who sums up in himself the community and the entire creation by his being existentially involved in both of them the church is catholic only by virtue of her being where his presence is ignatius i e by virtue of her being inseparably united with christ and constituting his very presence in history

6073755 in six months the authorities will fine the church again and then they will try to confiscate the building
6073756 we could not appeal against this because the building was not listed as belonging to us on the official documents
6073757 we are preparing all the necessary documents to rent land but its not going to be easy
6073758 we have to overcome all kinds of bureaucratic barriers including getting documents from officials responsible for electricity architecture public health water and sewage

6073764 the right of the public to attend court equality between the parties and the presumption of innocence
6073765 people who i did not recognise phoned me and threatened that they would kill me if i did not drop pressing this case
6073766 i think there is an influential person interested in the building and the piece of land
6073767 some people are interested in getting the building in good shape for free now
6073768 let the court case finish and only then we will talk to you about this
6073769 they will not do it because they are only interested in expropriating the religious organisations property
6073770 we were told by the authorities that they would give it back to the kindergarten
6073771 but no one including the kindergarten has done anything on the land
6073772 there is no building on that land it is an empty plot

6073783 none of us were rich so we had to make a little money to support our schooling
6073784 we had five horn players i played key bass on the organ so we did away with the bass we didnt have a string base
6073785 as a matter of fact double shot didnt even portray that
6073786 woke up this morning my head hurt so bad the worst hangover i ever had
6073787 you can imagine today they probably wouldnt even have looked at that
6073788 we only toured nation wide in 66 when double shot was big after that it was back to school
6073789 not going back to school would probably have split us up because of the draft
6073790 im real pickle with the fact that the people still remember us
6073791 hes been real complimentary on the band through his career
6073792 i guess after he saw us he figured if we could do it anybody could do it
6073793 it was like he came along and whispered some dream in everybodys ear and somehow we all dreamed it
6073794 you dont miss your water till the well runs dry and
6073795 i was six or seven when i started singing in church
6073796 i won first price and that brought me to the attention of phineas newborn who had a big 14 piece orchestra kind of like a count basie type orchestra
6073797 some of the things i learned back then i can still apply today how to read an audience how to time your shows
6073798 when you see youve got them at a fever pitch exit
6073799 they had much rather that i had gone the gospel route but since old man phineas sons were in his band and he had asked my mum about joining the orchestra she reluctantly agreed as long as i was back in time on sunday for church
6073800 but at that time i had the music in my head
6073801 i was always a poet even as a ten to twelve year old that was like an escapism i was always writing lyrics
6073802 they had b b king with a fifteen minute show where he would play and sing and then they had the teen talent singers where we would play three songs or so
6073803 i knew him both as a comedian and a dj he kind of was a surrogate father to all of us
6073804 it was weird my neighborhood was like the dividing line between black and white
6073805 early in the morning my mother would have coffee at the kitchen table and exchange recipes with the white lady across the street so i grew up with more of an open mind when i got with stax having the camaraderie with black and white it was a mixture there once we closed those doors we locked the world outside
6073806 it didnt matter if you were black or white it was all in terms of what you could bring to the table in terms of your musical abilities
6073807 it was like a family we opened a lot of avenues by being mixed
6073808 she was like a mother to us she was nutritious she kept us on the straight and narrow a lot of times because we would be teenagers back than it didnt matter to her if you were black or white if youd do something wrong shed be all over us
6073809 you dont miss your water till the well runs dry
6073810 as a kid i was always surrounded by grown ups
6073811 so i got a lot of that home spun wisdom from my grandparents and my parents and everything
6073812 his background was gospel too his father was a minister
6073813 but of course he was more of an up tempo singer wham
6073814 coming from memphis i got a little bit of everything
6073815 we used to flip coins to see who had to sit in the middle portion
6073816 i think in one year we did almost 300 one nighters
6073817 we were lucky we werent ran over by a plane
6073818 these days you probably couldnt do that without being shot
6073819 booker was more musical inclined all was more of a feel person he approached it almost from a religious point of view booker wanted it all to be structured musical correctly he was such a great musician really a multi instrumentalist long before it was fashionable
6073820 but then he came in and would take it to another level
6073821 it was the music that almost dictated the subject matter
6073822 after stax filed bankruptcy i was so disillusioned because as kids growing up we never thought that stax would end
6073823 disco was a 120 beats a minute and it was killing us
6073824 even though a lot of artists are still around they never came back
6073825 its too much a melting pot these days i like some of the modern stuff but to me individuality is what makes and artist all of the great artists whether its b b king chuck berry jimi hendrix or clapton they all had a distinct sound youd easily recognize
6073826 a lot of it is lost in the generic music of today because they use the same instrumentation the same chord structure it just comes across as fast food music
6073827 artist dont have a place to go and hone their craft
6073828 you have to be able to look your audience in the eye balls
6073829 i want you to take all your clothes of now
6073830 because of that dirty dancing tour we still have been working pretty much solid ever since its a blessing
6073831 before i knew it i was performing up and down the country at various corporate functions as well as casinos weddings etc its a crazy way to make a living
6073832 one of the greatest moments of my life was walking into the virgin megastore in times square new york and seeing a whole rack of the light of day a tribute to bruce springsteen cds facing me as i walked into the store
6073833 what was apt was that it was seeing bruce springsteen in concert that inspired me to pick up the guitar in the first place years later it was my version of a bruce springsteen song that led to me being signed so really i owe mr springsteen a lot if he ever wants an elvis impersonator for a party ill certainly offer him a cheap rate ha ha
6073834 perhaps the highlight of the sessions for me was recording johnny bye bye to be recording a song written by bruce about elvis death in the room where elvis made his first faltering steps that would eventually lead to his passing was incredibly moving it was a moment ill never ever forget it may sound clich d but i felt that in a sense id brought the two of them together somehow
6073835 im not sure that jack himself releases quite how significant he is in the scheme of modern music history
6073836 here was a man who not only played woody guthrie songs he was friends with woody and travelled with him he was the bridge between woody and greenwich village you take jack elliott out of the equation and our cd collections would be sounding very different today i know people always say that dylan was the heir to woody but the truth is that dylan only met woody when woody was very ill and could no longer play the guitar dylan learnt all the woody stuff from jack
6073837 i felt privileged that he felt me enough of a friend that we could talk about a lot of things but i dont feel its my place to tell any part of his story
6073838 bruce apparently went backstage during one the rolling thunder revue shows in the where he asked jack his autograph
6073839 although maybe its something i should consider for the future
6073840 i think in his heart bruce is a bit of an elvis impersonator himself theres no way he hasnt practiced all the elvis moves in front of a mirror no way
6073841 bruce is about the journey i get the feeling that hes always been very conscious of that journey in everything that he writes he seems to know where its going and where it may end up i dont believe elvis had that sort of perspective on his music i truly think there was a real artist struggling to be heard but he didnt necessarily have the tools or the advice on hand to make those decisions
6073842 i have come into the desert to pray to learn to pray
6073843 buy it use it break it fix it trash it change it mail upgrade it

6073847 the two girls have been left understandably upset by this mans actions
6073848 what he has done is completely unacceptable and i would appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident or who recognises the description of the offender to contact us
6073849 i would like to reassure parents in the area that these types of incidents are rare but i would urge people to be vigilant and come forward with and details they think can assist police
6073850 had access to the option tool yes in fact only two sellers had such access out of hundreds

6073872 they deny the holocaust where thousands of lgbt people trade unionists and disabled people were slaughtered
6073873 you may find a hundred rows of books about the holocaust you are not to pay any attention to them just concentrate on the one or two or ten books on row
6073874 where they burn books they will also in the end burn human beings
6073875 capitulation to dogma over the spirit of open inquiry leads to the very catastrophes that the unconscious proponents of dogmatism most fear thus we have the book burners of both left and right joined in common cause

6073877 code pink at a mock war crimes tribunal in istanbul june 27 signed a declaration that the iraqi insurgency deserved the support of people everywhere who care for justice and freedom
6073878 we must begin by really standing with the iraqi people and defending their right to resist i can remain myself against all forms of violence and yet i cannot judge what someone has to do when pushed to the wall to protect all they love the iraqi people are fighting for their country to protect their families and to preserve all they love they are fighting for their lives and we are fighting for lies
6073879 sure why do we have bases in the middle east we totally violated the rights of that country why do we get to have bases in the middle east
6073880 barack obama has said he knows he needs to earn the trust of the military when he speaks before the veterans of foreign wars today he could take a giant step toward earning that trust by renouncing jodie evans and her bundled campaign dollars and denounce her support of the iraq insurgency

6073883 lets come up with something that will get people talking
6073884 si zapatero y el gobierno socialista llevaron a europa el debate sobre su negociaci n con el terrorismo y el proceso de paz el lehendakari tambi n lo lleva a europa
6073885 lo tenemos entre vascos porque la mitad de la poblaci n cree que se vive mejor se prospera y somos un pa s en el que estamos c modos en espa a
6073886 el debate es entre vascos y no entre estados ni regiones
6073887 sigue en sus trece sigue empe ado en llevar adelante su plan y su refer ndum a pesar de que todo apunta a que es claramente ilegal
6073888 divide a la sociedad vasca y que no est dentro de las prioridades de los ciudadanos de este pa s
6073889 seguir planteando todo aquello que no suponga soluciones a los problemas de euskadi sino que supone m s problemas
6073890 no se da cuenta ni de la vertiente judicial ni la social ni la ciudadana
6073891 lo nico que le importa es cumplir con aquellas propuestas que ha hecho
6073892 no es muy sensato que el lehendakari conf e en que los tribunales acepten como legal su intento de refer ndum
6073893 evidente que desde los mbitos judiciales est n apuntando a la manifiesta ilegalidad de esa convocatoria
6073894 est intentando presionar a la justicia para que cuando se pronuncie l pueda tener una postura m s victimista
6073895 cuando un entrenador de un equipo de f tbol antes de un partido dice que el rbitro suele estar comprado y que por favor no pite en el sentido contrario al partido
6073896 est sirviendo para que demuestren que su pol tica de fondo es un refer ndum es la autodeterminaci n a plazos y esa posible independencia final
6073897 algunos matices en cuanto a la respuesta a las iniciativas que est n haciendo ea apunta a la desobediencia civil eb se apunta al carro contra el que hay en el poder y el pnv tiene sus diferencias unos dicen que respetar n a los tribunales y otros que hay que ir un poco m s lejos
6073898 se est n relegando los deseos y la realidad de los ciudadanos
6073899 mientras tenemos un gobierno vasco preocupado de su refer ndum aqu en euskadi el ipc sube a o tras a o un hogar vasco paga 400 euros m s por comprar lo mismo que el a o pasado
6073900 est s lo para planes y no para los asuntos que afectan a la vida cotidiana de los ciudadanos
6073901 lo normal es que la justicia lo pare porque es evidente que es ilegal
6073902 ganar votos de cara a las auton micas diciendo que no nos han dejado pronunciarnos
6073903 en condiciones de dar ning n apoyo a los socialistas vascos
6073904 reeditar un acuerdo con el pnv y mantener a ibarretxe en el poder a pesar de lo que dicen ahora porque todas sus declaraciones van en esa l nea
6073905 los votos del pp estar n destinados a la sustituci n de ibarretxe
6073906 un lehendakari que est en esos planes de ruptura que no se est preocupando de lo principal que es que los vascos lleguemos a fin de mes tiene que ir a la oposici n
6073907 va a estar con ibarretxe como en los a os 80
6073908 para lo nico que sirve es para agrandar los problemas del pa s vasco
6073909 son muchas las incertidumbres para que zapatero huya de las respuestas
6073910 con la que est cayendo el presidente da la espantada
6073911 lo evidente es que la actuaci n de la oficina no es escrupulosa con la legalidad y con la tica

6073926 we follow game trails or very often the native people walking through the area will have a path from one village to the next village

6073928 nondiscrimination on the basis of disability by public accommodations and in commercial facilities
6073929 this doesnt mean that the ada applies to all web sites but on the other hand if theres a bricks to clicks type of business and there is some integration of the experience between the two i think the court is saying that those sites need to comply with the ada

6073975 some bookstore owners say they want to remain neutral they dont want to alienate customers or the community they are in thats not me breathe books is a reflection of me one of the reasons i opened breathe books was to deepen my spirituality surround myself with books music beautiful items and other people all that would help immerse me into a lifestyle of learning wellness wholeness authenticity that others wanted to come along too is a blessing and a thrill so when i promote barack obama its the same as promoting louise hay jack kornfield or eckhart tolle its another way of surrounding myself with healers and im not ashamed to say it
6073976 your columns in shelf awareness made me think about another subject religion and how bookstores handle stock selection placement and display of this category
6073977 i know religion like politics is one of those topics that one shouldnt discuss at a dinner party but how do bookstores handle this category religion is something that is even more personal than politics interesting in this political year the religion of the candidates seems to be an important issue i think especially in this day and age allegiance to a political party is changed based on a candidate and his her position on particular issues people are not as apt to change religions as quickly although often it is done for the same reason religion affects our world view and our dealings with people

6073984 do not think that as you grow in grace the path will become smoother beneath your feet and the heavens more serene above your heads on the contrary reckon that as god gives you greater skill as a soldier he will send you upon more arduous enterprises as he more fully fits your vessel to brave the tempest and the storm so will he send you out upon more boisterous seas and longer voyages that you may honour him more you would have thought that abraham in his old age after the birth of isaac would have had a time of perfect rest let this warn us that we are never to reckon upon rest from tribulation this side of the grave no the trumpet still sounds the note of war

6074048 i think that the games have run with amazing efficiency i believe that the chinese people are warm and have been generally wonderful hosts to the games
6074049 today logging threatens the future of ecologically important areas creating uncertainty in the great bear rainforest it is time to get down to work and act on our agreements
6074050 i am very impressed by what five towns ctc and its community supporters have been able to accomplish
6074051 its great to be a finalist for the science to service award we hear from our program participants and their families that they love what we are doing and now we have the opportunity to receive the same recognition at the national level this type of recognition not only speaks to the star program itself but also to all of the dedicated instructors and community members who strive to provide high quality after school programming in the mid coast without their hard work and support we wouldnt be in the place we are today
6074052 it is very rewarding to be able to provide clear evidence that what we are doing works to positively impact the predictors of problem adolescent behaviors before children develop them being a finalist for a national level award is like icing on the cake we have the satisfaction of knowing we are making good things happen in our community and are getting recognized for our work too

6074055 im excited i think this is what ive needed kind of a prod to get moving in the right direction its been a number of years ive said i was going to do it and now this is a big motivating part of my life so
6074056 i took my kindergarten quizzes and did great the teacher made me problem solve and ya know thats what i do as a super hero im nurturing a wiggly tooth up front so who knows next time you see me i might have a gappy mouth
6074057 this is a very unique agreement and a real great public private partnership between the city and carbone
6074058 i have not got any malice against our landlords they are business people thats what they are in the business for
6074059 financially the clubs struggling but there just doesnt seem to be any mechanism to help out clubs like ourselves
6074060 we couldnt fund the house and fund the gym so we sold the house and actually moved into the gyms small flat and obviously thats cut cost tremendously
6074061 we are currently working closely with british gymnastics on a detailed plan setting out its priorities for the sport which will form the basis of our funding to the governing body between 2009 and 2013
6074062 we encourage clubs to discuss their needs with their national governing body in the first instance
6074063 per ora un giocatore del chelsea per il suo recupero dipenderebbe dalle motivazioni
6074064 domani sera vedremo qualche ragazzo abbiamo via diversi giocatori con le nazionali
6074065 abbiamo lopportunit di far giocare qualche giovane come darmian e di dare minuti nelle gambe a chi in agosto ha giocato meno come inzaghi brocchi e antonini spiega ancora il tecnico rossonero indicazioni possono arrivare anche da queste partite darmian far un tempo da difensore centrale e uno da laterale in porta far un tempo dida e uno kalac in difesa avremo sicuramente darmian favalli e antonini poi sceglieremo fra albertazzi e pasini a centrocampo ci saranno cardacio brocchi e ambrosini in attacco seedorf paloschi e inzaghi ambrosini far la prima partita da centrocampista poi vediamo domani affronteremo ancora un avversario di rispetto come la juventus ma la cosa pi importante sar la platea lo stadio di napoli sar esaurito e ci sar grande entusiasmo giusto che i napoletani possano assistere ad uno spettacolo buono gli stimoli ci sono
6074066 emerson ha fatto il primo allenamento con il gruppo sta bene ma ancora presto per farlo giocare prima giusto che faccia ancora un p di lavoro nesta ha ripreso ad allenarsi e lavora a parte ronaldinho dopo lolimpiade rientra a milanello questo confermato credo che il brasile contro largentina abbia un po deluso come squadra pato ha giocato un pomeno mentre ronaldinho ha patito le difficolt di tutta la sua squadra a giocare a certi ritmi
6074067 le notizie non sono ufficiali attualmente ancora un giocatore del chelsea i recuperi dei giocatori siamo abituati ad affrontare le sfide qualche volta andato tutto bene altre meno dipende dagli stimoli che hanno i giocatori quando vengono qui comunque al milan non mai stato un problema la gestione dei giocatori il difensore adesso cominciamo a recuperare i giocatori domenica tornano kaladze e maldini e torniamo a rifiatare in ogni caso contro la juventus la difesa andata bene anche con tante assenze ivanovic per il chelsea incedibile in ogni caso in generale non detto che arrivi shevchenko e non detto che il mercato sia chiuso se arriva lucraino
6074068 siamo vicini alla conclusione della trattativa e speriamo che quelle poche cose che si devono compiere si avverino quanto prima sarei lietissimo se sheva tornasse al milan e sono pronto a riabbracciarlo

6074070 ive never been so shocked over anything in my life
6074071 his spirit and his will are all summed up in those four words
6074072 col barnes is the epitome of onward ever backward never it shall be done
6074073 it all started one day when a tactical officer came out the back door of an officer candidates quarters and found a cigarette butt that had not been properly field stripped
6074074 col barnes and the tac officer discussed the terrible lack of the state of police call and it was suggested that the class should give it a funeral
6074075 the pilots fly the mission but we make it so they can fly
6074076 i think we have one of the most important roles in the mnd b mission
6074077 the goal of our company is to meet the crews take off time and complete the mission
6074078 we launch a team that is parked near the aircraft and they are on station so they can react to any maintenance issues they might encounter this is a unique concept we do here and it actually works very well
6074079 the beauty is it expedites the maintenance process so the maintenance crew can either fix the problems or they can simply have the flight crew switch to a spare aircraft
6074080 we have everything we need to do maintenance and repairs
6074081 with this new system there is no longer the go look for that tool before we had stuff everywhere now we have an inventory list which tells you exactly where to find each tool
6074082 the new vidmar storage units that were provided by the brigade are much easier to use because they can store and track parts much easier
6074083 im really happy but also a little sad about our result
6074084 we were determined to fight but were limited by our capabilities
6074085 i was thinking that we can do something more but not everything has to do with practice and games
6074086 i think we need more experience need more players in other clubs other countries
6074087 about 600 amish contractors or subcontractors work in at least a dozen states a rapid increase over the past decade
6074088 if there are a lot of mishaps and the mission is not going as planned then unfortunately we are really busy
6074089 when the mission is going well then we tend to not be working so much which is good
6074090 its something that has to be done as it gives closure and the proper respects that they deserve for paying the ultimate sacrifice out here
6074091 its so emotional out there and nobody else in the band gets to experience this but us we take a lot of pride in what we do and every time we go out there it needs to be perfect
6074092 some of them are young 19 year old trumpet players who have to grab their gear meet some folks that they probably dont know down at the helipad jump on a helicopter and just show up and play taps
6074093 i dont know that any of us even understand what goes though their minds
6074094 i feel its an important job but its also something that you dont want to do
6074095 if you have to go on a mission if you have to play taps it means that someone went down
6074096 i could hear him he was saying wheres daddy wheres daddy and it was rough because thats why we were there to play and render honors for him the childs father
6074097 we got shelled during the ceremony right before i was going to play taps
6074098 when you are doing a lot of memorials it can weigh on you and your emotional state is out of sorts you know what you are doing youre going on a mission to render honors to a fellow soldier who has paid the ultimate sacrifice
6074099 its also very humbling and its an honor to be there doing this
6074100 its been just sort of calm like everything is going well from a soldiers perspective
6074101 from our perspective you can definitely correlate how well things are going based on how busy our buglers are
6074102 i really dont think about the big picture too much
6074103 when i get notified that i have a mission i just try to focus on that i dont really try to equate it into the big picture just focus on what i have to do
6074104 i just focus on taking care of my guys making sure everybody has what they need and they take care of me just as much as i take care of them
6074105 he is very motivated i would say that he sets the right example and is the epitome of professionalism he always sets the example tactically and technically on the horn
6074106 as an nco non commissioned officer and as a leader hes phenomenal along with sgt rivera its like i said theyre a unique breed and hes the epitome of that
6074107 even within the band he stands out he could be an infantry soldier and he would be just fine hes got that mindset
6074108 even though its hard to deal with as buglers you can never complain about what you do
6074109 even if i had to do one hundred memorials in a month each one would be done to perfection every time it means so much to us that we render the proper military honors for our troops out here we put everything we have into it we put our soul into it
6074110 we need to find out who we have working up there and whether theyre doing their job
6074111 it is clear from the states perspective why were moving forward on this because its necessary for the qsa
6074112 restoration of the salton sea is an essential element of the quantification settlement agreement
6074113 it is fair to say the iid board was caught completely flat footed by the finished version of sen duchenys bill
6074114 important to iid and everyone who lives in the region
6074115 ok ill put it this way if i come back tomorrow and you have not showered im going to pack a diaper bag and a six pack of formula and take your baby away i will not return her until you have showered
6074116 at the moment you are not fit to care for wcb shes completely dependent on you and you are clearly making bad decisions her best interested are not going to be served by an exhausted in pain filled stinky mommy besides you always feel better after youve showered daddy o and daddy n will help me and you know it so make some time to shower in the next 24 hours and such ugly scenes will not come to pass
6074117 he spent the whole evening talking about his countrys investing in renewable energy so that when they run out of oil they will not depend on foreign countries for oil
6074118 la buena noticia es que es constante mientras mayor sea el estado de vitamina d menor ser el riesgo de desarrollar fractura de cadera
6074119 concluimos que las concentraciones bajas en suero de vitamina d se asocian a un mayor riesgo de fractura de cadera en las mujeres que habitan en la comunidad los mecanismos de la relaci n no est n claros
6074120 si uno no tiene la vitamina d adecuada no se puede absorber el calcio eficazmente
6074121 la vitamina d tambi n ayuda a mantener la salud sea al mantener las c lulas seas activas
6074122 para lograr los niveles de vitamina d necesarios para reducir el riesgo de fractura de cadera usted debe tomar al menos mil unidades internacionales de vitamina d al d a de un complemento
6074123 las mujeres deben esforzarse por mantener sus niveles de vitamina d por encima de 125 nanomoles por litro durante todo el a o para lograrlo tendr n que tomar complementos

6074127 we were only able to get a spot in the top eight with the level were at now but at least we have closed the gap to the top
6074128 thats thanks to all the matches weve played against european teams and to our own progress in recent years
6074129 the result is regrettable put a lot of pressure on us to make bad shots we didnt perform as well as we can lithuania played extremely well
6074130 four years ago we made it to the top eight but the process was really difficult and full of pain
6074131 when we got eighth it felt like a cake had fallen from the heavens
6074132 this time the result is a bit disappointing the process was full of passion we improved our training and raised our basketball competence my olympic journey has been full of joy
6074133 weve gained a lot of experience we had persistence motivation and a lot of passion its rare in my 10 years on the team that we played so many successive high level matches
6074134 four years ago i thought 2008 would not be far away but i had three major operations over that time i hope that wont happen again
6074135 the holy grail of enzyme catalysis and the ultimate manifestation of understanding of this process is the ability to design enzymes
6074136 what really fits is the electrostatic interaction between the enzyme active site to the substrate charges at the so called transition state where the bonds are halfway to being broken
6074137 umso wichtiger ist das wissen darum wie linezolid genau wirkt nur so kann das antibiotikum weiter verbessert werden
6074138 wir konnten zeigen dass das antibiotikum linezolid einen teil der stelle a im katalytischen zentrum blockiert so dass die trna dort nicht mehr richtig andocken kann
6074139 linezolid schafft es gleichzeitig das gesamte ribosom quasi abzuschalten es h lt also nicht nur das flie band an sondern schlie t gleich die ganze fabrik
6074140 er gleicht dem nicht vollst ndigen andocken der trna wenn linezolid einen teil von a blockiert
6074141 das erkl rt auch warum lepa diejenigen ribosomen erkennt und an diese bindet welche zuvor durch linezolid lahm gelegt wurden
6074142 the oxazolidinone antibiotics perturb the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center and effect trna positioning
6074143 a new trna intermediate revealed on the ribosome during ef4 mediated back translocation
6074144 der vorteil f r die unternehmen liegt klar auf der hand
6074145 die unternehmen selbst m ssen keine hohen investitionskosten f r die erforderliche hard und software tragen und k nnen dennoch von dieser zukunftsweisenden technologie profitieren
6074146 eww thats nasty i have never ever hooked up with michael phelps
6074147 solche systeme mit einer m digkeitserkennung zu koppeln k nnte ich mir sehr gut vorstellen
6074148 die gefahr dabei ist dass sich die fahrer dann auf diese systeme verlassen und l nger fahren und m der dieser ansatz setzt also extrem zuverl ssige und sichere systeme voraus um nicht neue gefahren zu schaffen
6074149 es wird nicht die einfachen technischen l sungen geben die m digkeit erkennen und sicher bek mpfen unterschiedliche ma nahmen sind notwendig f r berufskraftfahrer und f r privatfahrer technische l sungen m ssen durch den menschen erg nzt werden um das problem der m digkeit am steuer wirkungsvoll zu bek mpfen
6074150 warten sie damit nicht bis zum letzten augenblick man kann als fahrer ganz schlecht vorhersagen wann man einschlafen wird oder wie lange man noch wach bleiben kann oder noch besser schon in der nacht vorher so gut und lange zu schlafen dass man bei der fahrt nicht m de wird
6074151 whats the best way to get from here to there
6074152 but most real networks are dynamic network links go up and down and thus some nodes need to recalculate their routes in response
6074153 is to tell everyone flood the topology change throughout the network and have each node re compute its table of best routes but that requirement to universally communicate and to act on each change is a big problem
6074154 being able to adapt to hardware failures is one of the fundamental characteristics of the internet
6074155 our routing algorithm reduces the overhead of route re computation after a network change making it possible to support larger networks the benefits are especially significant when networks are made up of low power devices of slow links
6074156 is in how information about changes in the network is propagated the xl routing algorithm propagates only some updates reducing the number of updates sent through the network
6074157 the rules ensure that selected routes are nearly as good as if complete information about the network were available
6074158 but at a fraction of the overhead required for maintaining such a state of perfect knowledge
6074159 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
6074160 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
6074161 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
6074162 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
6074163 die werbeprospekte und produktdatenbl tter enthalten zwar viele technische details und ausstattungsmerkmale jedoch keine oder kaum informationen zum energieverbrauch der fernseher

6074174 wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the united states which could result in increased costs for companies seeking to employ technology professionals in india particularly project managers and other mid level professionals
6074175 if we hire people locally it will displace people we send from here on h1b visas so net net it will not mean an extra cost to us

6074177 several experts said tuesday that the conditions monday as tropical storm fay brought darkening skies over the beach in fort lauderdale fla were too risky for kite surfing
6074178 that did not stop kevin kearney 28 from gathering his kite equipment and heading to the beach
6074179 but at some point strong winds grabbed his kite and whisked him into the air
6074180 laat ik even opzoeken wat de antwoorden waren op die 2 vragen waar ik niet direct iets op wist te verzinnen
6074181 we have a line of equipment thats set up that takes us beyond these currently announced expansion plans
6074182 there was no clear vision and it shouldnt have even made it that far
6074183 this is a chance to raise awareness on campus about a variety of environmental issues that face our city state nation and world
6074184 by being creative about the way we spread the message we reach a much wider audience that we otherwise might not
6074185 this is an opportunity for everyone to get out and ride together in a safe legal and fun way
6074186 it will be a great time to come out and listen to great music at one of the best outdoor venues lexington has to offer in the memorial hall outdoor amphitheater
6074187 more importantly we hope they are inspired to make simple changes to their daily habits in order to have positive impacts on the economic social and ecological systems that support us all
6074188 people look at you and its not only the football game or the baseball game
6074189 what your colleges and your universities are doing is outside any law that congress could ever create
6074190 you are grabbing the issue you are taking the issue and you are running with it in a fair and responsible way
6074191 we could conceivably replace 30 percent of petroleum products with our naturally produced bio fuel and that would have a huge impact on the u s economy
6074192 for that kind of thing to get funded in excess of a student green fee its just a bunch of stuff that needs to get recycled all over campus
6074193 i think the administration is slowly becoming ready to go and to take action
6074194 but we dont have a history of doing it so weve got to get some momentum
6074195 playing drums and singing protest songs repels some students who dont have a history of doing that
6074196 hi my name is emma im a christian but im not weird

6074203 front and center in the coming showdown between coal burning plants and stronger federal limits on carbon dioxide emissions which are a major contributor to global warming
6074204 unless technology comes to our aid federal policies will almost certainly move in the direction of outlawing or severely restricting coal burning power plants
6074205 begin hedging their bets by pursuing clean coal technology as just one part of a mix of energy alternatives that could place kentucky in the forefront in this field
6074206 and um lord in case you didnt realize it we only received 1 2 3 4 pledge cards
6074207 aunque no nos conoc amos enseguida nos entendimos porque es un tipo tranquilo sin vueltas
6074208 la idea es que en media hora hagamos algunas de mis recetas y que la pasemos bien el programa va a mantener esa cosa espont nea que siempre lo caracteriz y que me pone a m en un lugar relajado porque soy yo misma
6074209 im doing very well now and im back to training twice a week ive come on leaps and bounds
6074210 i owe it all to the people that helped me and saved my life
6074211 i was really lucky that the people in my class were so good karen was doing cpr jon was giving me mouth to mouth and trevor was holding my head still alice was running backwards and forwards helping with the phone
6074212 i am so grateful to them if it wasnt for those four and their team effort i wouldnt be here
6074213 before this happened i took little things like walking for granted but at first i couldnt walk and now i am able to walk again i realise it is absolutely beautiful
6074214 there was some shell damage to buildings plus signs of widespread looting
6074215 there is an urgent need to provide people with food now we are particularly concerned about the people living in villages to the north of gori town

6074217 this contract award is an important win for boeing because it supports a cornerstone of the armys high energy laser program
6074218 hel td will give warfighters a transformational capability to counter the difficult threats posed by rockets artillery shells and mortar projectiles
6074219 boeing spent the past year developing the preliminary design of the hel td beam control system and we appreciate the confidence the army has shown in our efforts by awarding us these contract options to continue working on the program
6074220 this is the meeting that talks about cutting edge military trauma medicine
6074221 attendees can get the latest ideas and medical inventions here things that change the future most of the key players in the field come here
6074222 its a way to bring the battlefield to the scientists
6074223 this is increasingly becoming the forum for new clinical systems and performance
6074224 it facilitates focusing our research into areas where the u s isnt doing research
6074225 coming here helps us decide where to get greater money for our own research
6074226 the single most valuable thing that comes out of the combat casualty care meeting held each year is that it brings together u s and international expertise
6074227 an example is addressing the plan for improved training and how the army in particular is going to ensure competence in the future
6074228 as the exceptional training goes away its vitally important to sustain their professional abilities
6074229 were building a crescendo of results of saving lives and reducing morbidity
6074230 combat casualty care will continue to push the envelope of saving lives
6074231 theres a dramatic decrease in mortality from previous wars because of the advancements made in trauma care
6074232 the key has been those medics those doctors and medical teams doing what they do in horrible conditions
6074233 the 777 300er will provide tam with the lowest fuel consumption and operating costs available for airplanes in this class
6074234 advanced avionics of the electronic flight bag will further improve tams operating economics and reduce emissions
6074235 these acquisitions reinforce our policy of operating a young fleet that provides more passenger comfort in our quest for tam service excellence
6074236 for nearly half the worlds children especially girls and those from marginalized populations early childhood education is not guaranteed this is despite the fact that early childhood is the most significant period of development in our lives establishing the cognitive emotional and social foundation upon which we build our futures
6074237 by getting children ready for school we arm them with the tools necessary to build fulfilling lives become productive citizens and take their place in the global community
6074238 this symposium is vitally important as the more than 100 zambian and international experts will examine ecd best practices that can be implemented not only in zambia but globally
6074239 unicef has a strong partnership with the ministry of education in striving towards providing every zambian child with care development and education while they are still very young unicef is also pleased to be working in close collaboration with ngo and cbo partners in supporting the numerous early childhood care development and education centres eccde that are caring for zambias youngest children
6074240 after the symposium we are expecting increased opportunities for investment in ecd by national governments and also increased knowledge in early childhood care and development education provision in the region
6074241 we also expect to launch the southern african regional early childhood development forum finally symposium proceedings will be published for a wider national and regional audience

6074412 we have a great chance tomorrow and its about time we put that medal around our neck
6074413 but we are going to try to change this in this final weve been working for this for years
6074414 if we dont give them too much space i think we will have a good chance
6074415 a lot of the same players but were playing different our attitude is different and we play as a group
6074416 they were different teams a lot has changed since then we have improved a lot
6074417 we give brazil an ultimate amount of respect but we also have confidence in ourselves
6074418 we know its going to be a great game and were not taking anything for granted
6074419 they are strong physically and you cant give them any space well have to control ball possession at all costs
6074420 when you play a semifinal you play above all to advance to the final and to finish first so when you dont achieve that theres great disappointment
6074421 physically we arent at our top level right now brazil either
6074422 weve played five matches in 12 days thats a lot and there was a lot of travel and heat our team is diminished physically no doubt and we dont have a lot of choice in our rotation

6074430 they need to get judges to judge the b panel the way its written in the code i dont know how youre ever going to get them to do it
6074431 again im not saying the results are wrong thats the part of the got to find a way to let judges judge and not let them be worried about whether theyre in the average or not
6074432 surely everybody can make mistakes this is human but it is not allowed to be biased and make mistakes intentionally
6074433 i think theres room for improvement still and always will be that human element that theyre trying to legislate out of gymnastics will always be there when you have that you have the opportunity for mistakes you have the opportunity for incompetence

6074473 i could segue into some political rant here a slick dismissal of the bush administration perhaps or a paragraph declaring my support for barack obama but the moment i walked into the soup kitchen the moment i acknowledged publicly that i could not provide food for myself or my children which is why the soup kitchen is so much more difficult than the food bank is the moment that my ability to believe in the politics of this country was forever altered i know why poor people have historically low voter turnout rates if you vote you acknowledge that you believe in the system and to believe in the system when youre at the very bottom when youve watched the chrome and ink black suvs drive by while youre packing your own beater with dried beans and lentils to believe at that point is f king painful you either say the system works and youve earned your place or you concede that there is something wrong and there might not be any way to fix it the entire summer of 2007 as i struggled to keep us fed i hated thinking of politics an unusual characteristic for me it hurt to listen to any presidential candidate talk about the working poor and not because they werent genuine but because all their talk was just that talk it was like listening to my former self the one who didnt know how bad things could get

6074478 we would all be better off if those people would stop doing what they think is best for their children and help us take care of ours
6074479 what a match our bowling and fielding always keeps us in the hunt if only we had another 2 consistent batsmen other than sanga mahela and sanath to replace
6074480 badri should have been selected in the indian team 2 years back itself he is a prime example of selectors ignoring genuine talent and performance in domestic and a tours lesser batsmen got preference repeatedly over him perhaps the south zone selector in the selection panel has got something personal against him even for this series if he hadnt shouted after finally being fed up openly against selectors he wouldnt have got selected

6074485 i am really excited this is obviously my first time playing at senior level and my first time playing at ravenhill in a while so yes i am really excited and looking forward to it in truth i cant wait for friday night
6074486 i will be really proud when i run out on friday night ulster is the team i always supported when i was growing up and obviously with david playing for ulster for ten years i have been a regular attendee to the games matt williams talks a lot about the honour of playing for ulster rugby and wearing the red hand it is really easy to pick up on that if you are from ulster the foreign players have to buy into it but once they see the dedication from the players and staff and the massive commitment and passion shown by the supporters it isnt hard for them to realise what it means to play for ulster matt talks about it but we are all aware of it and know it ourselves it is a great honour
6074487 debate based on the merits of policy not on personal attacks
6074488 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
6074489 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
6074490 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
6074491 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
6074492 in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster

6074511 rational industrious useful human beings are divided into two classes first those whoes work is work and whose pleasure is pleasure and secondly those whose work and pleasure are one

6074513 the time for the great apocalypse of legend has come as you take on the role of war one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse and rain judgment and destruction on the earth
6074514 well maybe in the past i put blame on someone or something that didnt deserve it
6074515 could i have been the one to blame all along for everything thats gone wrong directly or indirectly to my relationships
6074516 were the major obstacles in my life that i failed to scale put there by myself all along
6074517 the strong one doesnt win the one who wins is strong
6074518 this is every day this is my job to get ready for thursday if i let myself get caught up in stuff that i cant control like who plays september 7th im really letting my performance be effected on thursday so no i havent thought about it im not worried about it im worried about thursday
6074519 im speaking honestly when i say we all have enough on our plate not to worry about everything else
6074520 i think with this offense trying to get this team ready and all of the installs and getting ready to play this thursday is enough to worry about theres not enough time to get into any other stuff
6074521 im not satisfied to be the starter coming into the third preseason game
6074522 its not a goal of mine i think that everybody wants to play and be the guy so well go from there but this is another opportunity to play well this week be consistent
6074523 im going out there treating it like that you have to
6074524 right now im really just thinking about todays practice and getting better from yesterday and getting ready to play chicago
6074525 we are just trying to get ready for chicago they are a good defense and they pose a lot of problems today was better than yesterday but there definitely still feels like there is a lot to go to get ready for this game
6074526 today was a pretty good practice and i think they are all battling hard and fighting its just helping us to get better
6074527 i think were in a unique situation with having three quarterbacks capable of starting and winning games for us
6074528 jt has done an excellent job in there with the first group alex has shown that he can make plays and shaun has been great as well were very fortunate to have three qbs in there that can win games for us
6074529 if my opportunity comes im going to do whatever i can to help my team
6074530 when your name gets called youve got to be ready to step in and do your best
6074531 hey man you cant go to the pro bowl sitting around like that
6074532 yeah this is how ill be when im in hawaii ill be reclining just like this
6074533 i think san francisco is actually one of the windiest places ive ever practiced in so it should be okay
6074534 i really never even worry about the weather or the elements i just make sure i secure the ball no matter what
6074535 conditions are something we battle when we go to chicago it is the windy city
6074536 the wind blows very hard and when the wind gusts over even 20 miles an hour it really moves the ball
6074537 andy and i will try to time up the plays with the gusts
6074538 we thank the fans so much for their support it is sad that it is the beginning of the end but it was a decision made by all six and it is a bit strange to call out what you already arranged its already been decided
6074539 separating the ownership of gatwick and heathrow makes a great deal of sense
6074540 it will put pressure on heathrows owner baa to get its act together

6074544 im hillary clinton and i did not approve this message
6074545 paging john edwards and barack obama your republican talking points are calling
6074546 ted kennedy endorsed obama to preserve jfks civil rights legacy what legacy
6074547 punishing wu and wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates that the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones were no more than a show
6074548 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
6074549 the idea of demonstration is that you are hoping to resolve issues not to demonstrate for the sake of demonstrating we are pleased that issues have been resolved through dialogue and communication this is how we do it in chinese culture
6074550 we want everyone to express their opinion everyone has the right to speak this is not the same as demonstrating
6074551 we asked for as much transparency as possible and we asked that the areas should be genuinely used
6074552 the olympics are about sport we are aware of the wider issues but opening the door through the olympics is a catalyst for development here that catalytic effect is happening but the olympics are not a panacea for all ills
6074553 the empirical evidence points in the opposite direction the games have had an overall negative impact we are seeing a pattern of serious violations of rights
6074554 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6074555 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6074556 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6074557 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6074558 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6074559 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6074560 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6074561 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6074562 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6074563 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6074564 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle

6074572 hudson has made several public statements of apology regarding his improper sexual encounter with a coed in 1994 what are we to do as catholics say it isnt enough
6074573 hudson and hagee have paid their dues its time everyone especially catholics acknowledged it kudos to the mccain campaign for seeing through this phony effort and standing by hudson
6074574 we feel that when wrong doers are given positions of power it sends a very dangerous message to victims a message that wrongdoers are rewarded and there is no point in reporting abuse since the predator is not punished

6074576 hey anyone know whos organising the office 2 0 conference
6074577 its cheaper to take the bus than to drive behind it
6074578 one of the things i think is most significant about this platform is that it recognizes that there is more than one way to discourage abortion
6074579 is not intended and never was intended to close the american mind or for that matter the catholic mind to different or alternative ways to discourage abortion
6074580 health care education income support adoption to catholics these are also pro life issues and moral issues
6074581 so theres a strong catholic basis for affirming much of this platform
6074582 barack obamas campaign and the democratic party have taken a historic and courageous step toward empowering women for an expanded range of choices and saving babies lives
6074583 there was a sensitivity in the campaign with how the language would play with hillary supporters
6074584 it was a cordial harmonious process in which neither side talked directly to each other
6074585 reducing the need is the only terminology that the pro choice community is comfortable with for good reason
6074586 theres been this fear factor that somehow looking for common ground will mean that to the demise of abortion rights there was an intense fear of the slippery slope
6074587 we deliberately steered the language from having any morality put into it because it would have been difficult to agree on the definition of morality biblical societal individual once you go down that path the ability to reach a compromise would have been limited
6074588 either side could put their own moral gloss on the language
6074589 we put a womans right to choose in a lock box and strengthened the language significantly
6074590 we needed it to assure that we were not backtracking
6074591 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
6074592 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
6074593 there was a genuine concern how not just the pro choice communities whose opinion they dearly valued but how a broad contingency of others felt about the language including catholics and evangelicals and leading pro life democrats
6074594 all the ingredients are there for those who want to see an abortion reduction agenda but still within the context of a womans right to choose
6074595 for the first time the democratic party is using reduce and abortion in the same sentence and for the first time it talks about the decision to have a child and supporting that decision the breakthrough was affirming that from the choice position there are two paths and heretofore the democratic party had only talked about one path
6074596 the language in this platform reaffirms in the strongest of terms the democratic partys solid commitment to a womans right to choose as defined by roe v wade
6074597 we are pleased that the party adopted language that is consistent with naral pro choice americas work to ensure that women have access to a full range of reproductive health options including preventing unintended pregnancy bearing healthy children and choosing safe legal abortion
6074598 the platform takes a significant step forward in affirming those whose moral convictions lead them to make a different decision than abortion
6074599 every indication is that with financial support and different forms of supporting pregnant mother and then some post birth help also we could come close to 50 reduction in abortions thats huge thats huge
6074600 if we insist on keeping this an ideological war were literally not saving the babies they could save
6074601 steal the thunder from those who are seen as traditionally pro life
6074602 ive now inserted this into the democratic party platform is how do we reduce the number of abortions
6074603 the fact is that although we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years abortions have not gone down and that is something we have to address
6074604 what i can do is say are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies so that we actually are reducing the sense that women are seeking out abortions and as an example of that one of the things that ive talked about is how do we provide the resources that allow women to make the choice to keep a child you know have we given them the health care that they need have we given them the support services that they need have we given them the options of adoption that are necessary that can make a genuine difference
6074605 we the g 7 stand ready to support georgia in order to promote the continued health of the georgian economy maintain confidence in georgias financial system and support economic reconstruction
6074606 end the hostilities and to bring about a political solution to the conflict in georgia the loss of life humanitarian suffering and wider destruction over recent days is considerable and we welcome commitments to assist with the urgent humanitarian needs
6074607 georgia has solid economic fundamentals as a result of economic reforms and sound policies and we are committed to helping georgia continue on this path
6074608 how do you win a war that is militarily unwinnable
6074609 obviously pulling out would be the worst of all outcomes but the solution can only be political even if that requires military supremacy the courage of soldiers demands the intelligence of politicians
6074610 even though the toll is so high you should be proud of what you are doing
6074611 theres been wide consensus for a long time in france that when the right times come the army must be used even if the price to pay for that will be the loss of soldiers
6074612 once the shock of these deaths eases people wont ask whether we can stand the losses we obviously can nor will it be whether this is a legitimate and important war for global stability it is debate will focus on how we get down to business and map out a way to beat an enemy that is very clearly getting stronger
6074613 maar zelfs als je de buitenlanders buiten beschouwing laat dan scoren de belgische profvoetballers over het algemeen nog altijd niet beter dan hun amateurcollegas
6074614 koolhydraten zijn nochtans cruciaal en met speciaal aangepaste voeding kan je het suikergehalte in de spieren verdubbelen en ook pieken naar bepaalde dagen eerder onderzoek heeft echter aangewezen dat sommige voetballers zelfs met lagere gehaltes aan wedstrijden beginnen dan gewone mensen gevolg is dat hun prestaties in de tweede helft drastisch achteruit gaan
6074615 terwijl voldoende vocht opnemen voor en tijdens een wedstrijd doorslaggevend is bij 2 procent verlies aan lichaamsgewicht door vochtverlies verlies je immers 10 pct van je fysieke capaciteiten bij 5 procent is dat al 33 pct
6074616 voetballers overschatten ook het suikergehalte dat sportdranken zouden moeten hebben bovendien waren er maar liefst 22 profs die dachten dat red bull tijdens een wedstrijd best kan terwijl amper vijf amateurs hetzelfde idee hadden wie zon energiedrank tijdens een match drinkt krijgt kort nadien echter een ongelooflijke dip
6074617 sommige ploegen zorgen er wel voor dat hun spelers zoveel mogelijk op de club eten maar anderen doen dat behalve op wedstrijddagen helemaal niet bovendien eten heel wat spelers uiteraard ook thuis er is bijvoorbeeld nauwelijks sprake van op maat gemaakte di ten zoals bij europese topclubs wel het geval is
6074618 te meer omdat ik merkte dat heel wat profs en overigens ook veel amateurs echt wel vragende partij zijn voor meer en betere informatie
6074619 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
6074620 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6074621 since saturday night ive seen a lot of confusion in the younger christian voting bloc because they thought they had figured this thing out
6074622 theres no absolutely right candidate for an evangelical and theres no absolutely wrong candidate theyre both right and theyre both wrong
6074623 to be perceived as authentic on this issue you need to have some grounding in it and usually that grounding is faith
6074624 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6074625 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6074626 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
6074627 would make a fatal mistake to assume that social issues especially abortion are ever off an equally blazing front burner for an inestimable number of social conservatives
6074628 ils ont r pliqu apr s avoir essuy des tirs et tout en demandant une reconnaissance a rienne h licopt re
6074629 yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay alright
6074630 in his book madness and civilization michel foucault talks about how madness was an invented thing that came along with the enlightenment when we expected things to be rational
6074631 we live in a world that is based on science and technology and is seemingly very rational but it is also weirdly surreal the boundaries between reality and fantasy are very porous
6074632 i was very fascinated by this hillary clinton generation of women that had achieved all of these laudable goals and had some degree of equality power and influence over society but in many ways were deeply unhappy
6074633 i thought it was quite funny if my cvs of the other leaders fell off the back of a truck youd all have a lot to laugh about that too
6074634 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
6074635 we havent given up on the whale but he does appear to be weaker than he was yesterday
6074636 when it takes to producing clean power were determined to make new york the number one city in the nation
6074637 it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants to our shores but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean wind farm
6074638 the best that can be said about these ideas is that theyre pandering
6074639 far worse theyre distractions from the deadly serious business of creating a new national energy policy
6074640 theres a whole set of factors that go into the ultimate cost of energy
6074641 when youre talking about relationships youve almost got to laugh or youll just cry
6074642 the quick repartee of a poker group i meet with every week
6074643 one issue that is plaguing the gay community right now is a lack of good positive role models for gay couples shows like queer as folk and will and grace just havent spoken to me at all so i thought write your own
6074644 we hoped that billy after the rest he had the swelling would be reduced
6074645 all theyve told me is to take some time let the inflammation get out of the elbow and wait for it to feel better
6074646 were in first place and were in a great situation right now i think we have a great chance to be in the playoffs and i want to be a part of that to me im very frustrated because theres not much i can do
6074647 the only thing i can do is take my anti inflammatory pills and just rest
6074648 all of us on the team i think we all kind of took it for granted that when youve got billy down there in the ninth inning hes going to basically shut it down
6074649 i think everyone has kind of realized that its kind of a tough job

6074651 redacted indicated bin ladin planned to sponsor suicide car bombings against us interests in the uk in part to punish london for submitting to us pressure to bar his entry into the uk
6074652 national islamic front nif leader turabi agreed to the expulsing of terrorist financier usama bin ladin on the condition that in the future he be allowed to return turabi and president bashin hoped that when bin ladin visited he would use false documentation and provincial airports to avoid publicity
6074653 could prove more dangerous to u s interests in the long run than his three year liaison with khartoum
6074654 his informal and transnational network of businesses and associates remains resilient
6074655 can retain the capability to support individuals and groups who have the motive and wherewithal to attack u s interests almost worldwide
6074656 many women have been complaining that the act has not assisted them since it was passed but my hands are also tied as the minister responsible for that ministry
6074657 last year i did not receive any allocation for that project and for this year nothing has come yet
6074658 for as long as we do not receive funding to implement such initiatives they will just exist on paper but will not protect anyone in practice

6074661 our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
6074662 technology is a tool to address some of the worlds most pressing challenges related to health care education economic development and the environment
6074663 no nations or individuals are untouched by these issues get involved be part of the solution
6074664 our engineers have put together an incredible processing family here that will include a tremendous amount of new processor features all centered on delivering faster computer performance and terrific energy efficiency
6074665 they the police told me privately they hate the fact he lives in wiltshire and they dont want him on their patch
6074666 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6074667 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6074668 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
6074669 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
6074670 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
6074671 teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics
6074672 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
6074673 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
6074674 most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment it gets the kids back in class it doesnt disrupt instruction its like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems
6074675 it works on some and it doesnt work on others
6074676 if youre one of the individuals that it does work on yes it will become a deterrent
6074677 i dont think its the schools place to make decisions like that
6074678 im not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either but i feel like if somebody makes that decision it should be the parent
6074679 we have had complaints about connectivity in the netherlands but have not had more complaints than usual for a 3g phone in germany our technicians said today apple has issued a software update but it is too early to tell if the problems are solved
6074680 we found some things in this area blue jeans size five from express
6074681 i found a couple of book bags some other articles of clothing some female clothing a female shoe
6074682 we did find a few articles of childrens clothing yes
6074683 it could be nothing it could be something it could be from another case
6074684 it could be kids who dropped them in the woods and lost them
6074685 hopefully if it does have anything to do with casey or caylee it helps them find out what happened
6074686 if she chooses to she could issue an inmate request form saying i wish i decline all future visitations for the time being moore said saturday morning
6074687 if she wanted to change that she could say i want to resume visits from whoever she has not done that
6074688 with nearly 70 percent of the states infected mosquitoes are here in the southeast region were taking coordinated action to reduce this threat
6074689 we are able to target our spraying closely enough n time and space as well as with low enough concentrations that it poses no harmful risk to humans including children
6074690 the product was chosen based on its efficiency and ability to be applied safely
6074691 this shows a cultural shift in public attitude where people understand that as a community by everyone getting health insurance we are improving the health of everybody
6074692 it shows them that its a good model for massachusetts
6074693 the intent of healthcare reform was that if people were getting coverage
6074694 that 159 000 is almost twice what was projected it translates into almost 1 billion more spent by employers on premiums
6074695 makes a mockery of the states allegation that employers have not done their fair share

6074717 there is no denying that the county and the uk economy as a whole are starting to feel the effect of the downturn however we have good reason to be optimistic in kent we have worked hard to develop the infrastructure and networks needed to support and foster innovation in the industry last year we saw the opening of ebbsfleet international and with the introduction of domestic services from december 2009 we are already starting to see plenty of interest from international companies
6074718 while domestic investment is still strong i believe that it is international investment that will drive the kent economy in the near future and we are exploiting every opportunity to promote the county to an international audience we have been running campaigns in the nord pas de calais region for many years and were recently involved in an event at the british embassy in paris to promote investment opportunities around ebbsfleet international station our brussels office has also just celebrated its 21st anniversary displaying kents long standing connection with its european neighbours
6074719 we are confident we will continue to be able to deliver high value sustainable economic growth and knowledge based jobs

6074727 we categorically reject that any sudanese be tried outside sudan we will never surrender any citizen to be tried abroad
6074728 the attempt to use the so called international justice against the country is an attempt to encourage rebel groups opposing peace to continue destruction and destabilisation to topple the regime in sudan

6074735 penndot has very limited interest in building a limited access highway unless absolutely necessary
6074736 i am dumbfounded because it was a clear hit yet our bet did not get a score for that
6074737 we disagree with the outcome but we have to accept it
6074738 we lost because we lack experience and exposure our opponents have
6074739 we are looking at possible semifinal encounter against name of popular athlete this comes after our bet will overcome name of lesser known athlete who seems to have lack of credentials
6074740 name of filipino athlete suffered ankle problem during the encounter
6074741 we did not tell you this but our athletes have suffered from food poisoning which affected their performance in the games
6074742 we didnt have enough time to train because of blah blah blah
6074743 oh it seems that my fearless forecast didnt work this time around
6074744 the preparation is completed and based on what i see we can win medals in taekwondo and boxing
6074745 we didnt expect our athlete to progress because we didnt have the luck of the draw
6074746 we had a hard time acclimatizing to the weather and our bodies were adjusting to the timezone
6074747 we couldnt find enough interest for this sports as filipinos are happier to be involved in basketball where we had no chance in winning medals in the past two asian games or billiards which is not an official olympic sports
6074748 if we had 3 million dollars for training equipment and exposure we could have probably won the gold medal

6074752 people are carrying out breeding which would be first of all entirely illegal in humans and secondly is absolutely insane from the point of view of the health of the animals
6074753 in some breeds they are paying a terrible price in genetic disease
6074754 the welfare and quality of life of many pedigree dogs is seriously compromised by established breeding practices for appearance driven primarily by the rules and requirements of competitive dog showing and pedigree dog registration
6074755 any dog may be shown but it is up to the judge to decide if it fits the breed standard
6074756 it is when characteristics become exaggerated that health problems can occur
6074757 this is something that the kennel club does not encourage and actively educates people including judges against doing as part of its fit for function fit for life campaign

6074819 the chinese governments own voluntary pledges to improve human rights allow public protests and guarantee complete freedom to report made meeting these self set human rights benchmarks one of the tests for a successful olympics
6074820 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed
6074821 may leave in place permanent technological surveillance and monitoring networks that make doing human rights work even more dangerous and difficult for chinese citizens
6074822 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia worden wrote last week in a commentary for the international herald tribune
6074823 but it could get even uglier in russia journalists are not only harassed they are sometimes murdered
6074824 silent diplomacy is fine but it has to be matched by change on the ground
6074825 if theres no evidence of change you have to back that up with public pressure he said human rights should be a higher priority as cities compete to host the games and urged the ioc to develop a concrete way

6074828 tibet is part of china the whole world knows that
6074829 the goal for the chinese government is to promote nationalism further

6074831 in the end they pretty much defined the terms in which the media was going to operate

6074846 the chinese government is desperate to turn the worlds attention away from its abuses in tibet as the olympics take place but the creativity and determination of tibetans and their supporters has once again ensured that tibetan voices are heard and seen in beijing despite the massive security clampdown
6074847 the chinese leadership must realize that the only way it can make the issue of tibet disappear is to acknowledge the demands of the tibetan people and work with them to bring an end to chinas occupation of tibet

6074858 hospitals and hospital administrators have traditionally discriminated against mental health conditions and people with them thats principally because of in my view the stigma attached to mental illnesses

6074875 we told the airlines we would allow them if someone gave a birth date to exclude that person from the list
6074876 let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk just like everyone else some airlines have done this some have chosen not to because they dont want to spend the money
6074877 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
6074878 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
6074879 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll

6074962 the result has been a credit crunch thats squeezing the life out of the u s economy but the federal reserve cant cut interest rates any further to spur growth without aggravating inflation in food and oil prices in fact the latest injection of money into the system to support fannie and freddie will likely lead to a further decline in the value of the dollar and increase inflationary pressures

6074969 la mayor parte de las medidas anunciadas esta ma ana por zapatero llegan tarde son oportunistas e incluso testimoniales como la congelaci n del suelo de los altos cargos y sin apenas coste presupuestario
6074970 zapatero ha utilizado esta ma ana un lenguaje literario poco apropiado y muy alejado del lenguaje econ mico necesario en este momento con el que parece que el gobierno espa ol aunque empieza a reconocer que la crisis es m s profunda de lo que han querido admitir hasta ahora sigue ocultando la realidad y dulcificando las cifras
6074971 hace menos de diez d as se ha ratificado en el congreso el acuerdo de techo presupuestario con un cuadro macroecon mico que no tiene nada que ver con las cifras que hoy ha hecho p blicas zapatero
6074972 el vicepresidente econ mico pedro solbes comparezca ante la comisi n de econom a y hacienda para dar las cifras reales del cuadro macroecon mico dej ndose de tanto lenguaje literario que de nada sirve para afrontar esta crisis y con el que parece que zapatero quiere seguir endulzando y encubriendo los malos datos

6074982 si su idea de ministerio transversal se va a limitar a ser una especie de control para que se cumplan las pol ticas de igualdad en el resto de ministerios quiz bastaba con crear un observatorio y no todo un ministerio
6074983 ah s ha dicho que no se est respetando a las comunidades aut nomas no es necesario que su ministerio se ocupe de esta rea porque no hay nada de qu ocuparse lo importante es que se de este servicio a los ciudadanos y ya lo est n haciendo con xito las comunidades aut nomas

6075134 even if there was an athlete that wanted to speak out on issues of human rights he might be silenced by whatever ioc official is mediating that press event
6075135 massive suppression of any voice that the government doesnt want heard
6075136 the chinese governments own voluntary pledges to improve human rights allow public protests and guarantee complete freedom to report made meeting these self set human rights benchmarks one of the tests for a successful olympics
6075137 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed
6075138 may leave in place permanent technological surveillance and monitoring networks that make doing human rights work even more dangerous and difficult for chinese citizens
6075139 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia
6075140 but it could get even uglier in russia journalists are not only harassed they are sometimes murdered

6075145 tibet is part of china the whole world knows that
6075146 the goal for the chinese government is to promote nationalism further
6075147 but ironically the olympic games exposed more social crises than ever like the tibet issue to the chinese people

6075151 when japanese athletes compete in the olympics they feel they are representing not only their country but also their race and all its members when a japanese is leading in a race the announcers voice becomes flushed with emotion when interviewed after competition swimmers and judo ists say they cant remember what happened so great was their emotion in fact in the moments leading up to a competition japanese seem almost paralyzed by nervousness they are not competing for themselves but for their coach their team their family and everyone if they win it was not because of their own effort but because of everyones support their greatest emotion then is relief from the relentless pressure if they lose they have let everyone down they cannot be good sportsmen and congratulate their opponents with a smile because their minds are elsewhere thinking about how they will apologize to their supporters

6075160 it was important to win and level the series before leaving for colombo
6075161 had we lost this we would have gone to colombo with immense pressure on us but now we can afford to relax fully before regrouping for the next game
6075162 there was great pressure on us after we lost gautam gambhir to injury in the morning it left us without a specialist opener
6075163 but zaheer did the job for us he hit the right areas and drew the batsmen forward forced them to play on the front foot and got those edges
6075164 that performance was backed by some good fielding and the other bowlers
6075165 we would have liked to win by a bigger margin but then its all about winning the game
6075166 we didnt want to put more pressure on anyone so we did away with the team meeting in the morning
6075167 there is no point discussing a thousand things and making strategies we left it to the individual players to prepare mentally for the game in their own way
6075168 promoting myself worked but the credit ought to go to badrinath
6075169 hes playing his first one day international and he was facing ajantha mendis and muttiah muralitharan for the first time
6075170 its good to see a youngster like him taking responsibility and batting the way he did
6075171 we had talked about it for a bit and we though 175 200 would have been a good score on this wicket
6075172 we expected the ball to do a bit in the first 45 minutes and we knew we had to survive the new ball but we lost four early wickets and that didnt help our cause too much
6075173 i think the boys showed great character to reach the total we got and the bowlers did a tremendous job
6075174 thats essentially biologism and racial ideology that would drag us back to the 19th century

6075257 as a last resort we are considering a fee for a minority of customers that simply do not use their card
6075258 given barclaycard holds a market share of around 15 it is likely we will see this trend spread across the entire industry
6075259 this is probably a good time for consumers to ensure they close down any accounts they no longer use
6075260 this reliance on two incomes to buy and run the family home means millions of households are effectively doubling the risk of financial hardship should one of the breadwinners become unable to work

6075304 metal is extreme it is touching whether it has a cathartic effect or a violent one or if people just like the music and dont pay any attention to the lyrics at all is very subjective
6075305 i have listened to metal since 1993 have never been involved in a fight and i am not the typical misfit guy despite having long hair
6075306 ok just a message to all you psychos out there if you plan on going on a killing spree please stop listening to metal at least six months beforehand start listening to bubblegum pop or r amp b or something the last thing bands want to hear is that people blame them for your actions

6075309 why do the media never make the connection between someone killing a person and the presence of a mariah carey album in their collection metal fans are often perceived as stupid angry satan worshipping drug taking immoral young men with no hope and no future

6075324 es war kein schlechtes rennen aber mit dem resultat kann ich nicht zufrieden sein
6075325 es war eines der schwierigsten rennen meiner karriere ich habe alles gegeben um nach vorne zu kommen hatte in den ersten runden auch kein schlechtes gef hl ich kam an die spitze heran aber nach acht oder neun runden baute der hinterreifen ab ich wei nicht warum aber ich verlor mehr grip als die anderen und meine zeiten wurden schlechter

6075340 online communities therefore can constitute an important external source of innovation for those firms able to implement a constructive relationship with them dahlander and magnusson 2005 individuals in these communities may not only be able to develop innovations that can be integrated into the firm but also may come up with new perspectives on and ways of framing problems the community may develop a shared and mutual understanding of what it is about what in the new product design or features is valuable it may create product firm loyalty and establish among community participants a sense of belonging and meaning rindova and petkova 2007 despite these benefits there is also a range of challenges for firms that adopt the open innovation approach chesbrough 2006 this is particularly evident when managing online communities as individuals participating in these communities are beyond the firms hierarchical realms individuals can decide where to work who to work with and what to work on making it difficult for firms to steer the direction of development dahlander and wallin 2006 moreover in online communities the social processes behind members participation are intrinsically dissipative because in such self organized processes many individuals have to be mobilized to make the most productive ones emerge david and rullani forthcoming this greatly increases the resources firms have to pour into these communities and increases the risk of such investments a large number of involved parties with misaligned goals different capabilities and diverse degrees of involvement raise the issue of governance of online communities in order to advance our understanding of the open and distributed nature of the innovation process taking place through online communities this special issue revolves around the two themes identified above as crucial 1 the importance of conceptually including the symbolic value of the artefacts in the innovation process as online communities can be fundamental tools by which firms can innovate in this sphere thickening the symbolic value of their product and 2 the issue of governance and how it is associated with the way in which firms try to harness these communities both themes have been relatively unattended by earlier research the papers in this issue were selected precisely on the basis of the questions and answers they might generate with respect to these overall themes

6075360 in epoca non sospetta e in particolare alla riunione dei ministri della difesa della nato circa due mesi fa e successivamente in un incontro con lambasciatore russo a roma ho sostenuto fermo restando la praticabilit di un allargamento della nato che bisognasse operare con estrema prudenza
6075361 bisogna mettersi anche nei panni della nuova russia che poi ha conservato un po della mentalit e della cultura della russia di sempre e vero che i missili che stanno mettendo servono a uneventuale difesa nei confronti delliran ed vero che parlare di allargamento alla georgia vuol dire difendere la georgia o almeno cos si diceva da altri e non dalla russia ma dal punto di vista dei russi questo atteggiamento occidentale e della nato pu essere visto con grande sospetto e personalmente anche in altri tempi ho sempre sostenuto che in casi del genere dovremmo coinvolgere il pi possibile la russia nelle decisioni e in ogni modo operare con gradualit e prudenza
6075362 ne sono convinto grande prudenza perch io mi ci metto nei panni della russia a prescindere dalla valutazione del comportamento dei russi di ora che non apprezzo e non approvo gi da prima avevo provato a calarmi nei loro panni e ne comprendevo le ragioni
6075363 in occasione della mia visita al contingente in libano ho espresso pubblicamente il mio apprezzamento per il generale graziano perch ho ricevuto degli ottimi report diciamo cos da parte di tutti israeliani americani e tutti gli alleati
6075364 non che gli americani ci chiedono un ruolo pi di primo piano senza incertezze n penso che prodi e dalema avessero personalmente incertezze nel sostenere lintervento in afghanistan erano gli alleati che analizzando la situazione italiana non potevano essere rassicurati sulla durata dellimpegno quello che cambiato il clima maggiore fiducia tra noi e loro e ci comporta la possibilit di operare in pi stretta sinergia ma non c nessun accrescimento di rischio solo la capacit di fare con trasparenza le cose che facciamo mentre prima era come se le nascondessimo meno se ne parlava e meglio era insomma maggiore possibilit di collaborazione gli impegni che prendiamo non solo vogliamo mantenerli ma questo forse valeva pure per dalema ma possiamo mantenerli
6075365 sulla falsariga del personaggio che ha creato su di me non corrisponde al cento per cento ma credibile non vero ma verosimile fiorello stato anche fortunato mi avessero dato il ministero della giustizia o delle riforme il personaggio gli funzionava parecchio di meno secondo me ha fatto una petizione a berlusconi che lha accettata
6075366 beh ringrazio molto cervi di cuore e raro che un ministro venga accusato di fare molto di solito laccusa di fare poco
6075367 dal punto di vista personale non sono un patito della gerarchia e della disciplina militare lo dimostrano le mie note caratteristiche quando ero ufficiale dellesercito non erano pessime ma poco ci mancava
6075368 mi contestavano una certa insofferenza alla stretta disciplina di caserma allobbedienza senza discussione alla gerarchia a tutti i costi inevitabile lo capisco ma si scontrava con il mio carattere un po ribelle invece mi piacciono davvero e per questo sono felice di fare il ministro della difesa i valori di cui le forze armate sono un presidio lorgoglio dellidentit nazionale la difesa della sicurezza e della libert lidea di nazione valori alla base di molti che hanno abbracciato la carriera militare quindi la sintonia totale
6075369 mi sono battuto per il superamento del servizio di leva ma leffetto negativo pu essere quello di tagliare ogni contatto tra i giovani e le forze armate perci ho immaginato un mese allanno per chi vuole di addestramento atletico mentale e militare con una bella iniezione di riferimenti culturali un mese di educazione alla disciplina che non fa male ai giovani di oggi e che prepari anche allattivit di servizio civile lo sa che il volontariato che viene fatto dagli ex alpini il pi apprezzato di tutti
6075370 e chi la tocca la libert di espressione la mia infatti proprio una libert despressione cerano i film di tanti registi di sinistra che dipingevano i nostri soldati come fannulloni o come guerrafondai o senn quelli della cosiddetta commedia allitaliana dove erano tutti maniaci del sesso
6075371 mica tanto la novit che completamente mutata la percezione che gli italiani hanno delle loro forze armate del loro esercito e delle divise tutte dai carabinieri ai finanzieri e ci metto anche la polizia fino a poco tempo fa quello in divisa era il guerrafondaio loppressore il violento era la cultura dominante adesso culturalmente abbiamo fatto cappotto se prima dovevi immaginare la pace pensavi alle bandiere colorate anche con tanta gente in buona fede che sfilava sotto di esse oggi vengono in mente i soldati che fanno le missioni allestero se pensavi alla sicurezza subito il pensiero andava alla fratellanza e alla solidariet ottime cose per carit ma adesso anche agli uomini e alle donne in divisa che fanno rispettare la legge grazie a dio una certa fase passata
6075372 ma ce ne sono anche altri sto cercando di recuperare qualcosa ho chiesto a un critico cinematografico maurizio cabona di aiutarmi a dar vita a una rassegna di film sulle forze armate negli anni cinquanta quando entrammo nella nato quel periodo l fu diverso prima del tentativo culturale purtroppo riuscito di dipingere gli uomini in divisa in un certo modo spero di riuscire a inaugurare questa mostra cinematografica a roma in coincidenza con il prossimo 4 novembre festa delle forze armate
6075373 niente contraddizioni i titoli tuttal pi in entrambe le dichiarazioni sostenevo che il leader berlusconi e che ora non c un problema di leadership e lo stesso non c dubbio che quando sar il leader naturale sar fini ma parlarne proprio perch il leader naturale un errore che crea solo confusione
6075374 qualche piccola polemica nel partito da parte di chi ricerca un ruolo se in questo si manifesta ununanimit esagerata inevitabile che qualcuno cerchi di assolvere al compito di dire non sono daccordo succeder di sicuro ma il rapporto tra noi e fi costante dal 94 e sono stati i nostri militanti con la famosa manifestazione del 2 dicembre quando hanno mischiato le loro bandiere a chiederci un simile passo e inoltre alle elezioni politiche per la prima volta nella storia ditalia la somma complessiva dei voti a una lista composta da pi partiti come quella del pdl era superiore a quella dei partiti stessi
6075375 volendo non ci vuole molto a capire che questo solo il dato nazionale poi va adeguato citt per citt regione per regione per an un rapporto leggermente migliore rispetto a quello che abbiamo oggi in parlamento dove siamo al 28 per cento nel 70 per cento di berlusconi c lincidenza degli alleati pi piccoli siccome tutti si rivolgono a lui lui ha il dovere di mostrarsi generoso e abbiamo scovato questa formula cos che possa mostrare tutta la sua generosit non tanto quantitativa quanto qualitativa e poi i pesi si mischiano e fra un anno nessuno si ricorder da quale condizione era partito
6075376 alemanno quando deve dire qualcosa chiama tra lui e gasparri in questi mesi c stata qualche incomprensione poi gasparri andato a trovarlo a mezzanotte in campidoglio e sono stati a discutere fino alle due e mezza del mattino poi insieme mi hanno telefonato per dirmi che avevano risolto il loro piccolo problemino una volta certe cose si trascinavano per anni
6075377 a me veramente non mi ha offeso mi ha fatto fare una bella risata quando poi mi hanno detto che laccusa veniva da un prete in vacanza al sole di marettimo ho proprio sghignazzato la prova provata che questa storia del fascismo una bufala sta proprio nel fatto che non solo lui dice queste cose ma che sciocchezze del genere cos fuori dai tempi della storia e cos indietro rispetto alle lancette dellorologio in italia fortunatamente si possono dire senza nessuna conseguenza n politica n personale pi risposta netta di questa che si pu dire

6075385 that northward shift in the storm track is tied to reduced early spring precipitation especially over the southwest u s
6075386 it looks like the northern great plains seem to get a little bit more rain
6075387 the dry season in parts of the country that are already quite arid
6075388 the change so far in total precipitation is pretty small
6075389 we expect that this may continue or even get worse
6075390 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought

6075401 no you cannot take ice cream to school for lunch
6075402 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6075403 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6075404 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6075405 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6075406 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6075407 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6075408 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6075409 they want to know what were going to do about it
6075410 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6075411 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6075412 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6075413 even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defendants religious beliefs
6075414 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6075415 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6075416 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6075417 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative
6075418 is that our red post box or is it a real one
6075419 i usually give you all one or two tone words when we have a meeting like this but if i were to give you two words this time they would be euros lyn
6075420 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6075421 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
6075422 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
6075423 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
6075424 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled
6075425 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6075426 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6075427 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6075428 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative
6075429 is that our red post box or is it a real one
6075430 i usually give you all one or two tone words when we have a meeting like this but if i were to give you two words this time they would be euros lyn
6075431 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6075432 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
6075433 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent
6075434 im of the star wars generation i love science fiction star trek the next generation battlestar galactica love em
6075435 i love every morning getting up to go to work because that little boy inside of me jumps with excitement every time i know im going to fight an alien or shoot a rocket gun or be on a spaceship or be with the doctor or get onto the tardis
6075436 so every time im working on it im really really happy
6075437 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
6075438 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
6075439 but it should be one of his best episodes out of his career too he got to kiss me
6075440 the reason torchwood has gone down so well in america which tv executives should look at is the fact that their audience isnt uptight
6075441 its the executives who are treating the audience like theyre uptight because theyre pandering to programming for one specific audience and forgetting about everyone else out there
6075442 the stories have changed there are stories that people can actually relate to
6075443 a lot of people who argue that the stories are too risque theyre too in your face theyre too heavy for young people theyre afraid of dealing with those situations and theyre afraid of seeing real life on television what were doing is actually what people deal with in their everyday life we just do it in the realm of science fiction
6075444 i like the writers to create the story and create the fantasy for me so that i can then go and try to make it work but if im on set and were doing it and a director will ask me to do something that is completely out of context from what jack would do or what any of them would do we can actually say something
6075445 the producers trust enough and we know the characters well enough that we just know they wouldnt do or say something
6075446 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6075447 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6075448 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6075449 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6075450 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6075451 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6075452 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6075453 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6075454 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6075455 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6075456 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles
6075457 when you run you delve a little deeper into yourself and empathize when they hit their wall and think i just cant do it
6075458 he is aging very gracefully healthy and smart much better than i did at his age he is national class
6075459 its training and leading up to a race for me
6075460 ive always had good pulmonary lung capacity its been my strength its carried me through a lot
6075461 it was kind of half hearted i was not prepared
6075462 i dont know exactly what it was that brought me back
6075463 thats a tough one a buddy of mine got me to run with him in the 2006 tucson 10 miler i did 1 07 and things snowballed from there
6075464 people who cant walk or dress themselves lots of stroke victims amputees hip fractures
6075465 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
6075466 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
6075467 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
6075468 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
6075469 but how many people are willing to make a commitment to watch something over five consecutive nights these days whats the dramatic point that cant be served by weekly episodes or are they relying on everyone recording it or iplayering it
6075470 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago
6075471 this continues the weaker picture seen in june and points towards the more subdued levels of lending we are likely to see in the second half of 2008
6075472 we have handed the case to the police and also submitted our findings to our disciplinary board
6075473 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
6075474 the cost of capital of this nature is just staggering

6075492 the title is actually referring to djing when youre putting on some motown
6075493 originally it was going to be called bag it up and then it was going to be called shock of the lightning and then it was going to be called standing on the edge of the noise
6075494 i couldnt think of any ideas and then somebody had just taken bits of the lyrics out and dig out your soul was what came up i was like you know what titles become themselves
6075495 definitely maybe isnt a great title but if the album is good enough itll become itself dig out your soul is not the best one but dig out your soul was the best one on a day when we had to choose one
6075496 i was playing some drums on some demos left over from the last record
6075497 we sent them to producer dave sardy and he was like wow have you got any more songs like this we should make a record like this
6075498 and then going back to the stuff we ditched in the past we were like yeah we could do something with that or do something with this
6075499 slowly but surely it all started to change from a traditional british rock album to this whatever one we would describe it now
6075500 its got a drum solo in it i dont know the last time there was drum solo on one of our records im not really a keith moon drummer im a neanderthal im a basher i just stick to the backbeat
6075501 its ludicrous absolutely ludicrous coleen mcloughlin musnt have had any scent out that week or something

6075528 the olympic games wont be a watershed for chinas economic growth
6075529 the fundamentals propelling the countrys economic development over the past 30 years will remain
6075530 our projection of slower growth in china is based on our belief of a weaker global economy in the coming year with economies in europe and emerging markets all slowing more
6075531 we do expect to see some very weak data being reported in the next couple of months
6075532 in reality chinas economic and financial market challenges have little to do with the olympics and more to do with slowing global demand rising input costs and domestic imbalances

6075534 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6075535 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature

6075537 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6075538 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war

6075540 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6075541 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

6075546 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
6075547 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
6075548 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
6075549 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
6075550 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

6075555 that top 1 of earners pay 39 89 of all the federal individual income taxes the bottom 50 of earners pay just 2 99 of those taxes

6075621 we were all such good friends in college but the wnba is a lot different said anosike who plays for the minnesota lynx
6075622 people have lives of their own and lives outside of basketball whereas at tennessee our life was pretty much school and basketball
6075623 i look back at that situation and i really miss it and cherish it i try to keep in touch with alex and me and shannon had dinner when she came to play in minnesota and i talked on the phone with ut coach pat summitt a few times
6075624 the difference now is you have so many games in row
6075625 you have back to backs youre traveling its a lot different from college here youve got to be ready to bounce back you might have a game that goes into overtime one night and youre flying right into the next city the next morning for another game
6075626 during our rookie orientation we heard from a lot of the great players in the wnba like stacy dales who recently retired and she told us you really dont have time to get down on yourself after a loss because number one its not that horrible when you lose
6075627 in the wnba youre losing but so is everyone else so you kind of have to look at it that way
6075628 my living conditions are pretty good but the traveling is hard bobbitt said
6075629 im not used to going through security at the airport or having to wait in lines at restaurants im used to being spoiled like i was at the university of tennessee
6075630 here its more of a job setting i miss that college feel
6075631 coach bill laimbeer and assistant coach rick mahorn do a great job of giving us the days off that we need to allow our bodies to rest hornbuckle said
6075632 everything is just kind of on your own and i kind of like that i like to sleep in my free time so to not have to go to tutoring or night class that feels real good
6075633 we realized that we were on opposite ends now and it was just a matter of two great teams going at it bobbitt said

6075639 the summer spike in fuel and food prices is causing shoppers to pare back their plans for tax rebates and back to school spending thats clearly squeezing spending on retail goods other than food and gas

6075661 just as we segment marketing strategies for external customers so too must we develop different internal messages by each segment of the workforce effective workforce measurement means that the right people have the right access to the right data at the right time overwhelming managers with data that they dont need is a mistake just as is making managers go looking for strategically relevant data
6075662 a way to convey the companys strategy clarly and completely to every employee to drive strategy execution effectively the workforce needed a high degree of business literacy as well as a very clear understanding of the organizations businesses and its business priorities

6075673 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader

6075683 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6075684 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6075685 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6075686 the actions of the current prime minister show signs of high treason and political corruption
6075687 russias leaders are seriously considering supporting prime minister yulia tymoshenko in the presidential campaign once she fulfils the condition of adopting a passive position in the conflict with georgia
6075688 fully fledged work in the interests of the russian side
6075689 i want you to go to the window open it stick your head out and yell im as mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore
6075690 the people of abkhazia intend to ask the russian leadership to recognise abkhazia
6075691 make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
6075692 its the police who must deal with people like the leaders of separatists in abkhazia not me
6075693 clearly define what it considers its sphere of influence and dare anyone to challenge it
6075694 transformed itself into an authoritarian power determined to re establish its hegemony over its near abroad
6075695 crushing defeat for the georgian military and georgian policy altogether
6075696 for his efforts to reassert control over south ossetia and abkhazia
6075697 ensured that the breakaway enclaves will stay free of georgian control for the foreseeable future
6075698 reminded all of the countries of the russian near abroad that it is once again a major world power to be crossed at ones peril
6075699 demonstrated that ignoring its objections to kosovo independence has definite consequences
6075700 a remarkable lack of appreciation in the west of the implications of russias drift towards authoritarianism and aggressiveness
6075701 think hard about its policy of strong engagement of potential new members such as georgia and ukraine
6075702 to send a strong message to russia about the consequences of the georgian action and anything similar

6075704 the chinese have rapidly built up supply chain capability and are likely to have nine gigawatts of manufacturing capacity in a few years
6075705 china is also likely to become a significant exporter of wind turbine equipment in a few years adding to its already strong presence in the solar industry
6075706 there is now a two year period of consultation and review before any of the proposals are implemented this will leave just ten years for the uk to establish a renewables infrastructure strong enough to meet its 2020 target
6075707 the uk is possibly being overly dependent upon its ability to translate ambitious targets into reality and needs to concentrate and improve its delivery track record if its position is not to decline further
6075708 strong contrast to the speed at which germany has addressed the challenges placed by the eu renewables directive
6075709 on the whole the credit crunch has not impacted upon the attractiveness of the sector
6075710 to make the uk a world leader in attracting investment in this sector and to avoid it slipping further down the index the government needs to consider creating tangible incentives for investors following the lead of germany and the ambition of china
6075711 the uk is still an attractive place to invest and renewables are a good long term investment a ten fold increase in renewable energy will bring on around 160 000 jobs and an estimated 100bn of investment from the private sector

6075718 the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job

6076077 there are so many variables in bringing a production to broadway theater availability artists schedules and securing capitalization to name but a few
6076078 its impossible not to be cognizant of the national economy and its potential impact on the theater but its also premature to say whether the recent changes in plans by certain shows represent a trend especially as were likely to see other productions quickly step up to fill the available theaters in their stead

6076089 all the hard work weve put in is coming to fruition were getting results and things are going better than expected

6076091 but i think that previously for the wallabies our technique was found wanting the physio doubled up as a scrum coach and even though he was an ex prop he had to split his time between medical duties and coaching
6076092 michael who also focuses attention on the line outs devotes at least 50 percent of his time to scrummaging

6076145 when i played next to kevin donnalley who was in his 12th or 13th year it was just great to be next to someone whos been through it its an extra comfort for a rookie there is a lot of communication that happens in the offensive line really on every play thats helpful to have that kind of experience next to a rookie
6076146 ive played around a lot of young guys and to this point i think jeff is really physical especially coming out of college into the pro game and hes pretty smart so now the big thing is being consistent and i think hell get to that point

6076212 really source of proof please science observation proves you wrong and a habitual chronic pathological liar as well
6076213 on june 12 1980 a third explosive eruption produced 25 feet of stratification that amazed geologists successive layers are traditionally thought to require long periods of time to form yet upwards of 100 layers accumulated mostly between the nighttime hours of 9 and 12 while a plume swiftly ascended nine miles above the mountain wave after wave of pyroclastic flows began hurtling out of the crater and down the north slope each dusting the valley below with another lamination measuring from a fraction of an inch to over a yard in thickness each took from a few seconds to a few minutes to form
6076214 geologist steven austin described these pyroclastic flows as ground hugging fluidized turbulent slurries of fine volcanic debris they moved down the mountainside at hurricane speeds and left deposits of 1000 degrees f one would expect each deposit to be homogenized amp thoroughly mixed remarkably these high velocity slurries of red hot ash and pumice separated into coarse and fine particles of perfectly defined layers such features follow laws governing flows demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks
6076215 similar thin layering appears in the tapeats sandstones of the grand canyon
6076216 yup you could explain to me that you have observed first hand the layering in your septic tank too im sure there is an analogy here but it escapes me at the moment do tell what is the connection
6076217 i suppose you did read darwins radio your choice of reading materials reveals a lot dawkins specialties are fiction and fantasy not observable science his much acclaimed among fools weasel analogy was a complete fraud youre clutching at fables in a last ditch effort to avoid the conclusion that there is a god to whom you will answer one day youre not ready for that
6076218 hey bj antibiotics kill bacteria not viruses you cant kill viruses with antibiotics and viruses dont mutate in response to antibiotics theyre unaffected sheesh i would have thought you would get it the first time you were corrected your knowledge of science is pathetic and youre a very dense slow learner
6076219 so we have layer upon layer fair enough of varying thicknesses of pyroclastic flows why is that such a big deal and yet again i gave to remind you that such layers are not sedimentary
6076220 yah and bears make big potty in the woods so what are you still beating that one trick pony i regret to inform you but your hobbyhorse is dead
6076221 are you a complete freaking idjit the point is that the aggregates were not only layered but segregated according to aggregate size what you have at msh is 25 feet of finely layered segregated aggregates laid down in 3 hours not a long series of separate volcanic eruptions one ringy dingy two ringy dingy if you cant comprehend the material go back to the nursery and retrieve your binky
6076222 for anyone who just tuned in see 7 wonders of mount st helens
6076223 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6076224 they maybe layered but they formed as a result of volcanic activity so they are not sedimentary rocks sorry for shouting but hopefully it may sink in eventually
6076225 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6076226 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen this presents a problem if you believe in uniformism and evolution
6076227 actually crime is on the rise especially rape and murder it may still be low but for countries with small populations its a drastic increase on top of that scandinavia in particular norway has cultivated and spawned some powerful anti religious movements the black metal movement that grew to infamy in the 1990s hit the national newspapers with almost one hundred church burnings and espoused a venomously anti christian doctrine its adherents worshipped odin the norse gods and satan they wanted not only the continued decline of christianity but a revival of nordic paganism in addition scandinavia has a healthy population of laveyan satanists so there still religious the just don t follow the bible paganism has always been in scandinavian countries and its been on a sharp rise in the last 20 years santa clause is worshipped every year all over the world santa came from the scandinavian religions of old so there quite religious just not christian
6076228 why would i do that the bible goes all the way back to creation its not given by an angel of light
6076229 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6076230 your density amazes me both gas charged slurries which formed the msh strata and water charged slurries which formed the tapeats strata follow the same laws of physics i e they follow laws governing flows of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks the volcano has demonstrated that such formations can be formed rapidly a global flood would have produced tapeats in a brief time
6076231 the difference is that this demonstration of the behavior of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris at msh was a gas charged slurry while the flood was primarily a demonstration of the behavior and end results of water charged slurries on a much more massive scale the flood also involved the laying down of volcanic debris but the whole demonstration was inundated with water for a year so what happens when volcanic debris is thoroughly mixed with other types of aggregates and subjected to the conditions that have already been demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks hm m m m would you not get the rapid formation of a great number of segregated layers of sedimentary rock in a very short period of time good grief man the ancient romans used volcanic sand and ash to make concrete doesnt that tell you anything
6076232 you also said they were living matter which they are not now that is an interesting hypothesis viruses which are not alive mutate therefore proving evolution in living things somebody help me with this i swear that somewhere i read that the flatworm was evolving faster than the human my thought then why are they still flatworms

6076234 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive
6076235 one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life

6076245 for this reason i say to you do not be worried about your life as to what you will eat or what you will drink nor for your body as to what you will put on is not life more than food and the body more than clothing look at the birds of the air that they do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not worth much more than they and who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life and why are you worried about clothing observe how the lilies of the field grow they do not toil nor do they spin yet i say to you that not even solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace will he not much more clothe you you of little faith do not worry then saying what will we eat or what will we drink or what will we wear for clothing for the gentiles eagerly seek all these things for your heavenly father knows that you need all these things but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you so do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will care for itself each day has enough trouble of its own

6076364 the personal finance column in business on sunday erred in how it described insurance of individual and joint accounts it said that each persons interest in individual and joint accounts is added together to determine that individuals insurance coverage in fact individual and joint accounts are insured separately therefore you could have an individual account worth 100 000 and a joint interest in a 100 000 joint account and all of your deposits would be fully insured
6076365 couples can set up an in trust or testamentary trust account for their children for a maximum of 600 000 in insurance coverage

6076367 the climate crisis is significantly worse and unfolding more rapidly than those on the pessimistic side of the ipcc projections had warned us

6076370 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6076371 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6076372 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6076373 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6076374 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6076375 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6076376 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6076377 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6076378 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6076379 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6076380 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6076381 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6076382 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything

6076384 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6076385 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now

6076401 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
6076402 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
6076403 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
6076404 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now

6076436 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
6076437 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6076438 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6076439 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6076440 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6076441 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6076442 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6076443 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6076444 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6076445 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6076446 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6076447 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6076448 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6076449 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6076450 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6076451 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6076452 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6076453 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6076454 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6076455 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6076456 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6076457 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6076458 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6076459 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6076460 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6076461 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

6076464 if i said it was a great ball game that would be an understatement this was softball at its best internationally
6076465 you saw great pitching great defence adjustments at the plate an international tie breaker you saw a little bit of everything the sport has to offer
6076466 i felt like i was shaking the entire game we have so much want to go out on top
6076467 it was a different japan in the medal round i hate to say it but we knew it would be a close game
6076468 the next game is just a stepping stone to the gold medal match so well just take it one match at a time
6076469 im really excited it was a great win for us all
6076470 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6076471 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6076472 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6076473 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color

6076495 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
6076496 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6076497 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less

6076499 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections

6076504 though we live with thousands of different illnesses we have more in common than not for example illness impacts our families careers finances and daily living to name a few we can all learn from one another and share during this journey
6076505 and frankly people are tired of hearing but you look so good and they want others to know that there is great pain involved despite how well they seem to be holding it all together
6076506 life disrupted getting real about chronic illness in your twenties and thirties
6076507 when you are a young adult people expect you to put in long hours to establish a career to jump into the dating world and to build a life for yourself but they certainly dont expect you to be sick theres no such thing as too young to be sick that is just one of the many reasons why invisible illness week is so important

6076513 when we started the movement it was a small open mic in the back of a restaurant
6076514 now were an internationally recognized brand with franchises in three continents weve been forced to adapt and change with the times we went from a crew of friends making music to business men with marketing plans and proposals weve grown and had to adopt a more professional approach to what we do
6076515 i feel that eow is successful and able to do a weekly show that never gets dry or old because we love the music and the culture and have a great respect for where its rooted we consider ourselves grown men in the hip hop game so we have a seasoned outlook on things one of our matras is maintaining the integrity of the culture that in itself shines through and draws people to the dub

6076531 in den ersten f nf monaten des laufenden jahres haben wir mit einer reduzierung der co2 emissionen um 3 4 prozent einen berdurchschnittlichen erfolg erzielt
6076532 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6076533 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6076534 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6076535 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6076536 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6076537 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6076538 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6076539 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6076540 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6076541 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6076542 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6076543 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6076544 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6076545 i think if you are looking at price plans you have to look at the total cost of ownership you cant just look at the cost of the device itself
6076546 in terms of churn i dont expect the iphone to revolutionise singtels fortunes or for them to eclipse starhub and m1 in the end it will make a small change if anything
6076547 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6076548 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6076549 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6076550 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6076551 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6076552 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6076553 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6076554 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6076555 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6076556 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6076557 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6076558 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6076559 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6076560 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6076561 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6076562 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6076563 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6076564 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6076565 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6076566 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6076567 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6076568 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6076569 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6076570 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

6076574 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6076575 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6076576 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6076577 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6076578 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government

6076581 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6076582 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6076583 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6076584 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6076585 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6076586 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6076587 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6076588 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6076589 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6076590 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6076591 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6076592 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6076593 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together

6076595 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6076596 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6076597 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6076598 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6076599 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6076600 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6076601 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6076602 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

6076604 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6076605 the dream of chelsea is broken because real madrid will not even negotiate it is impossible to advance any conversation
6076606 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6076607 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6076608 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6076609 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6076610 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6076611 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6076612 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6076613 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6076614 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6076615 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6076616 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

6076623 i hope the london bus will be a new symbol of shimonoseki
6076624 at first i wondered if the london bus would suit the city but now i can tell its well suited to the retro look of the city
6076625 the bus was tough to drive because it has its own style
6076626 but driving the london bus is a lot of fun as people wave their hands to us with a big smile which had never happened before in my career
6076627 it was so scary as the roof is high so the balance can shift really easily but im used to it i hope it will top the tourists list in shimonoseki
6076628 sungguh beruntung orang yang mensucikan jiwanya dan sungguh merugi orang yang mengotorinya

6076631 engkau menyembah allah seakan melihat nya jika engkau tidak melihat nya sesungguhnya ia melihatmu
6076632 bukan itu yang aku maksud tetapi malu kepada allah dengan malu yang sesungguhnya yaitu menjaga kepala dan apa yang dipikirkannya menjaga perut dari apa yang dikehendakinya ingatlah kematian dan ujian dan barangsiapa yang menginginkan kebahagiaan alam akhirat maka ia akan tinggalkan perhiasan dunia dan barangsiapa yang melakukan hal itu maka ia memiliki sifat malu yang sesungguhnya kepada allah

6076672 green living is getting sexy even a year ago people wouldnt have been nearly as receptive to this kind of thing
6076673 but as the importance of living green gains traction in our culture people are willing to take things like that a lot more seriously
6076674 most environmentalists will agree the mainstream success of the al gore vehicle an inconvenient truth has helped give climate change the pop culture sheen its currently enjoying indeed global warming is a cause to which everyone from diesel apparel to vanity fair magazine and starbucks are pinning their marketing efforts
6076675 and if shopping to save the planet is trendy having sex to clear your conscience is at the cutting edge
6076676 it feels like people are just waking up to the fact the planet is suffering under our uses of it

6076685 this rant is about sex and the greenies i generally find myself pretty much turned off completely by the greenies so i ignored the green sex movement until it was brought to my attention i looked a little deeper and now i feel dirty
6076686 there are two elements of the green sex movement that i took note of first the no sex aspect the alter eco website claims in case you wondered there is another world out there that isnt just about sex i found this curious while this fits the general attitude of so many greenies i cant help but wonder why they simply just dont advocate no reproduction instead of no sex then again sex is a pleasure and is something to be enjoyed which are two things that arent often associated with environmentalism after all its hard to hate yourself and other people and enjoy sex and physical pleasure
6076687 of course the biggest ecological impact resulting from sex is a baby
6076688 i would pass it off as a joke but i think these loons are serious nasty

6076718 its very hard to be a career person and have a relationship i didnt succeed at doing it all its incredibly hard
6076719 thats a really old fashioned idea its so low for someone to have said that they dont say that about men so its sexist and horribe
6076720 i may one day but it wont be because someone told me to i alsot think that the demographics of who sees movies have changed
6076721 women over 31 want movies that are about them so there are a lot of big surprises left the baby boom generation is getting older and it wants something more satisfying than why the movie makers expect
6076722 president sarkozy and other french authorities have repeatedly requested russia to abide by this commitment of withdrawing their forces
6076723 we have done it repeatedly over the last days and so far we have not seen anything that points to any credible sign of withdrawal of russian forces and that is why today we decided to seize the security council to press upon the parties and press upon russia in particular that these commitments the commitments they have entered to have to be respected
6076724 whatever the final outcome of these discussions one thing is clear now south ossetia and abkhazia lie within georgias internationally recognized borders
6076725 only yesterday august 18 the united kingdoms defense attache to georgia was turned back from a russian checkpoint in georgia and told he required a russian visa in order to proceed further do foreigners need now russian visas to travel within georgia
6076726 its hard to see how russian actions are consistent with russias claim justification for their military assault namely the protection of its peacekeepers and civilians in south ossetia and abkhazia even though most of those civilians have only recently been handed russian passports and havent lived in russia
6076727 the position of the russian federation is crystal clear and regrettably the position of some of the councils members is not anymore a secret to anyone
6076728 this is by far a nonconstructive position and may be a position with a double or even triple bottom meaning
6076729 to achieve this we need i think the whole international community needs the support of the security council which has to produce an appropriate resolution supporting these six points

6076763 whats killing me right now is that as much as id love to just go ahead and build everything according to rods suggestions im hitting bottlenecks here because suppliers either wont sell their stuff to me because im not some construction company that can order their minimum order or they do not have any data regarding the products they sell such as what is the optimum weight to compress their neoprene puck pad i can put the ceiling on the new walls like rod suggested but i cant get anyone here to tell me how to distribute the weight of the ceiling walls among the neoprene pucks pads since the suppliers of the neoprenes dont have such data and the manufacturers often just make things based on specs given by some previous client and they dont test these products and have no relevant data available either so if i place an order for something its pretty much a mystery if the item even matches the characteristics of the stuff people usually use in the states and elsewhere believe me my contractor and i both would love to make this as painless as possible but having run around the entire city and scouring the web we are getting pretty frustrated you cannot post new topics in this forum you cannot reply to topics in this forum you cannot edit your posts in this forum you cannot delete your posts in this forum you cannot vote in polls in this forum pro audio forums read this if you are a new poster for more information on advertising investing merging or any other ideas you may have for this community

6076790 what im asking us to do is what the state of new jersey is asking us to do and that is sit down with linden and see if there are ways we can save our taxpayers money
6076791 we can no longer afford to live the way that weve been living
6076792 what we want to avoid is a situation where we are spending the taxpayers hard earned dollars on our own fire services when we could receive a higher level of service from linden at a fraction of the price
6076793 that is why we want to have this study done to make sure we are spending our money as efficiently as possible
6076794 i think its worth exploring we need to look at any innovative way of saving money

6076804 jika engkau memohon maka mohonlah kepada allah dan jika engkau meminta pertolongan maka mintalah pertolongan kepada allah
6076805 kemudian jika kebutuhan yang dimintanya menurut tradisi di luar batas kemampuan manusia seperti meminta hidayah petunjuk ilmu kesembuhan dari sakit dan kesehatan maka hal hal itu mesti memintanya hanya kepada allah semata dan jika hal hal di atas dimintanya kepada makhluk maka itu amat tercela
6076806 hadits ini berikut keterangannya menegaskan tidak dibolehkannya meminta pertolongan kepada selain allah
6076807 aku berdoa meminta kepadanya sehingga ia menyampaikannya kepada allah lalu allah menyembuhkanku
6076808 sesungguhnya engkau adalah seorang alim engkau banyak habiskan umurmu untuk membaca kitab kitab tetapi sungguh mengherankan engkau justru mengambil akidah dari bibimu yang bodoh itu
6076809 pola pikirmu adalah pola pikir wahabi engkau pergi berumrah lalu datang dengan membawa kitab kitab wahabi
6076810 orang orang wahabi adalah mereka yang melanggar tradisi orang kebanyakan mereka tidak percaya kepada para wali dan karamah karamahnya tidak mencintai rasul dan berbagai tuduhan dusta lainnya
6076811 ini adalah seorang syaikh yang tawadhu rendah hati tidak suka orang berdiri untuknya dihormati
6076812 segala puji bagi allah bahwa kita termasuk orang orang islam dan salaf sebagian orang menuduh kita orang orang wahabi ini termasuk tanaabuzun bil alqaab memanggil dengan panggilan panggilan yang buruk
6076813 dan janganlah kamu panggil memanggil dengan gelar gelar yang buruk
6076814 jika rafidah berarti mencintai keluarga muhammad maka hendaknya jin dan manusia menyaksikan bahwa sesungguhnya aku adalah rafidhah
6076815 jika pengikut ahmad adalah wahabi maka aku berikrar bahwa sesungguhnya aku wahabi
6076816 wahai pohon kurma yang paling agung dan besar aku menginginkan suami sebelum setahun ini
6076817 dan janganlah kamu menyembah apa apa yang tidak memberi manfaat dan tidak pula memberi madharat kepadamu selain allah sebab jika kamu berbuat yang demikian itu sesungguhnya kamu kalau begitu termasuk orang orang yang zhalim
6076818 jika engkau memohon mohonlah kepada allah dan jika eng kau meminta pertolongan mintalah pertolongan kepada allah
6076819 mengapa ia menjadikan tuhan tuhan itu tuhan yang satu saja sesungguhnya ini benar benar suatu hal yang sangat mengherankan
6076820 ya allah berilah keberkahan kepada kami di negeri syam dan di negeri yaman mereka berkata dan di negeri nejed rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam berkata di sana banyak terjadi berbagai kegoncangan dan fitnah dan di sana tempat munculnya para pengikut setan
6076821 dan mereka berkata jangan sekali kali kamu meninggalkan penyembahan tuhan tuhan kamu dan jangan pula sekali kali kamu meninggalkan penyembahan wadd dan jangan pula suwaa yaghust yauq dan nasr
6076822 dan kami telah mengutus kepada kaum aad saudara mereka hud
6076823 hai kaumku sembahlah allah sekali kali tidak ada tuhan bagimu selainnya maka mengapa kamu tidak bertakwa kepadanya
6076824 hai kaumku sembahlah allah sekali kali tidak ada bagimu tuhan selain dia
6076825 hai kaumku sembahlah allah sekali kali tiada tuhan bagimu selain dia
6076826 dan mereka heran karena mereka kedatangan seorang pemberi peringatan rasul dari kalangan mereka dan orang orang kafir berkata ini adalah seorang ahli sihir yang banyak dusta mengapa ia menjadikan tuhan tuhan itu tuhan yang satu saja sesungguhnya ini benar benar suatu hal yang sangat mengherankan
6076827 demikianlah tidak ada seorang rasul pun yang datang kepada orang orang yang sebelum mereka melainkan mereka mengatakan
6076828 ia adalah seorang tukang sihir atau orang gila apakah mereka saling berpesan tentang apa yang dikatakan itu sebenar nya mereka adalah kaum yang melampaui batas
6076829 dan bersabarlah terhadap apa yang mereka ucapkan dan jauhilah mereka dengan cara yang baik
6076830 maka bersabarlah kamu untuk melaksanakan ketetapan tuhanmu janganlah kamu ikuti orang yang berdosa dan orang yang kafir di antara mereka

6076880 we didnt feel that it was appropriate for those individuals who want to lead our country to engage in divisive political activity on 9 11 nine eleven needs to be a day that is forever preserved as a day of unity and day of remembrance and day of compassion when we put aside our differences and we think about how we can help others in need

6076919 we expect third quarter results will be hampered by declining global equity markets further deterioration in mortgage assets and slower levels of corporate and institutional activity
6076920 is still a few quarters away as we anticipate additional asset sales and write downs in coming quarters throughout the financial services sector
6076921 once again the majority of our negative estimate revisions are being driven by higher than estimated write downs on mortgage assets

6077078 americas future leaders must always remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and that is where americas military must stay

6077080 but eight years later al qaida terrorists came back to finish the job
6077081 what we know is that in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial they are currently in u s prisons incapacitated
6077082 and the fact that the administration has not tried to do that has created a situation where not only have we never actually put many of these folks on trial but we have destroyed our credibility when it comes to rule of law all around the world and given a huge boost to terrorist recruitment in countries that say look this is how the united states treats muslims

6077104 a few of our students want to do medicine and we had two students on 575 points with another on 565 so we were very pleased with that
6077105 as per usual the students who worked well got the results

6077230 when corporations yank business the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum

6077234 someone has finally done it the gulf between us and non us carriers continues to widen how does ua think they can get away with this on routes where they compete with british airways air france lufthansa etc
6077235 to me seems to be about the dumbest idea ive heard of in a long time unless all the other carriers follow which is entirely possible i guess ill never pay to fly an airline that charges for food on a transatlantic flight
6077236 we are looking at various routes to meet what looks like a shortfall at this stage we knew this would be difficult i dont think i can go into details because i dont have the direct management of that question
6077237 its just thats not my particular responsibility at the moment although im rather concerned about it
6077238 the projection of a deficit in the immediate period following the conference was always recognized
6077239 the shortfall in funding is unclear as bills come in to be settled but it is likely to be approaching 1 million
6077240 the shortfall is being addressed as agreed by the continuing fund raising programme
6077241 involved the participation of some 680 bishops and 3000 participants

6077261 the faint rattle of phlegm buried deep in my bronchia
6077262 i think about tituss death often the horrifying story of that death the images of that death the pulverising consequences of that death on my grieving granddaughter but i dont want to go there now i cant go there now i have to push it far away
6077263 so is it with this calamity it does not touch me something which i fancied was part of me which could not be torn away without tearing me nor enlarged without enriching me falls off from me
6077264 titus is no longer quite human he becomes the idea of a person a person and not a person a dead bleeding thing une nature morte
6077265 no division between life and writing life as it is lived in the intimacy of the body of the blood that flows through ones veins
6077266 i spoke to her possibly for the last time at one of the award parties for the cohen prize
6077267 as a child a journalists daughter i felt most clearly the distinction between the undemanding georgian world i lived in and the world of bloomsbury my world was hampstead muffin men autumn leaves peter pan at christmas the poetry bookshop where walter de la mare w h davies and eleanor farjeon read aloud our favourite verses for this was the last era when poets and the general public were on easy terms with each other bloomsbury was brilliant poetryless cambridge hardened in comparison we knew we were homely
6077268 i think it was awe rather than hatred that we shabby long ago georgians felt
6077269 and im perhaps the last person alive who used to go to sleep as a child with a coal fire and the p oetry b ookshop rhymesheets on the walls
6077270 when he was a policeman on the beat 1928 9 used to shine his torch into the window of the second bookshop and learn the poems off by heart
6077271 a book about the poetry bookshop and its own particular poets anna wickham charlotte mew and f s flint
6077272 i thought it might amuse you as its about a very small bookshop
6077273 as far as my poetry bookshop is concerned i do realise that youve turned it down kindly but firmly 4 times so far
6077274 far and away the best living woman poet who will be read when others are forgotten

6077276 told me that the poetry bookshop staircase made an appearance in ash wednesday
6077277 i can remember what it was once like from a visit when duncan grant was there admittedly a dreadful mess but it doesnt seem at all right either now that its clean and tidy the same is true of william morriss house at kelmscott i dont remember him but i do know he kept an iceland pony in the kitchen tolstoys house in moscow i liked largely because the curators had got out of hand and were making tea all over the place but perhaps im ungrateful to feel like this
6077278 i really dont see how one can do without a family
6077279 on those lovely days when some dreadful thing or dreadful loss happens and seems even worse because of the blue sky
6077280 and yet i feel theres the whole story of an era there and lph was so much nicer than forster
6077281 the worst thing about the opening of howards end isnt so much the letter itself as a method as the one may as well begin with it makes me feel resentful why begin at all if thats how he feels about it
6077282 i felt the weakness of the book georges father acting as a kind of nursemaid as one of emfs embarrassing wise characters
6077283 i am drawn to people who seem to have been born defeated or even profoundly lost they are ready to assume the conditions the world imposes on them but they dont manage to submit to them despite their courage and their best efforts they are not envious simply compassless when i write it is to give these people a voice

6077294 i dont know if it makes any difference with us as the operator but it ought to improve services to our employees
6077295 working to reduce costs in those administrative areas is one of our focuses
6077296 we actually have the systems so it doesnt take a lot of labor to do it you can add work in and it doesnt really take more people to get it accomplished
6077297 i think what youll see is that in those areas where we can reduce some of the workload well then take those people at y 12 and shift them to other jobs at y 12

6077321 as soon as i found out about this security issue we acted immediately to shut down any access to this information
6077322 the princeton review takes internet privacy seriously and we are currently conducting a review of all of our procedures
6077323 current sat course diagnostic tests are not as reflective of the real e t s tests as they should be
6077324 in this case it would have made sense for the company to separate information such as the names of the students from their test scores and whatever confidential information the company had
6077325 but we are finding that companies today dont change until they have experienced the pain of a data breach that is exposed to the public
6077326 the commission is devoting significant resources to facilitating this transition
6077327 we intend to take whatever actions are necessary to minimize the burden on consumers

6077340 wal mart clothes instead of kohls penneys etc in some cases
6077341 more discount internet shopping without tax or shipping to replace purchasing from local or national merchants shopping more bulk at discount warehouses track grocery sales and double triple coupons
6077342 replaced gas for car with a bicycle a couple times a week
6077343 going out to movie theaters replaced with blockbuster total access

6077346 i like to challenge my own thesis when i am bullish on a stock because these are just pieces of paper
6077347 we didnt miss every bad party but we missed most of them
6077348 but i would also say that theres nobody on my staff who would still be working for me if they made a comment like that about anybody of any ethnic group and i would hope that nbc ends up having that same attitude
6077349 this will not spoil the games it will spoil nothing if blonska testing positive would ruin the games that would kill us
6077350 it is not because blonska is doped that we scrap bolt that would kill us
6077351 it may well be we will take measures the ioc took the measures with the olympic games we could also do similar things and take out sanctions with regard to the world championships
6077352 salary bonus and stock compensation rose about 9 in the companys last fiscal year to 27 1 million according to the companys proxy statement however mr murdochs overall compensation fell 14 because of an accounting change that eroded the value of his retirement savings
6077353 but news corp said in the filing it changed the discount rate used to calculate its pension plan
6077354 this is a great day for us what really makes a phone is whats inside a phone
6077355 by combining the complementary strengths and product offerings of ericsson and st in platforms and semiconductors the joint venture is well positioned to become a world leader
6077356 i usually check the count and look at the scoreboard to see where im at but i was pretty confident it was 2 and 2
6077357 i threw my pitch and he ran off and my catcher ramon kind of hung his head when coco turned around the umpire seemed to say no you go they convinced me i was wrong
6077358 it said 3 2 on the scoreboard i guess that threw people off
6077359 i would have never have thrown that pitch on 3 2 especially where i threw it
6077360 i wish i couldve had that last pitch i guess i should have spoken up but the way everybody reacted i thought i was the one who was wrong
6077361 im basically going more into debt with this second one
6077362 some people have plasma tvs and a cool wardrobe im making an investment in myself
6077363 its a risk because the minimum payment on the credit cards keeps going up every month at the same time im either going to be a filmmaker or nothing else
6077364 it was february 2006 in munich and john mccains eyes were flashing with the mischievous spark that comes when hes about to fire a verbal rocket ive got a zinger coming he told me referring to a speech on russia he would give a few hours later at the annual munich conference on security policy
6077365 carry more of them live regardless of the time zone than nbc traditionally has done
6077366 i hit somebody hard up there on 35 i hope theyre all right
6077367 who is the ace argument for the off season but its clear that lesters been the best pitcher on the staff in 2008
6077368 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
6077369 spam has become a mainstream means of advertising for restricted or counterfeit goods due to strong demand from internet users many of us dont consider spam to be a legitimate marketing practice but the products that people are buying arent legitimate there is a huge market for cheap goods that are otherwise expensive or hard difficult to come by via legitimate means
6077370 many of us often question ourselves why is there so much spam the answer is enough people are purchasing products from spam to make it a worthwhile and profitable endeavor for spammers
6077371 es war immer ein traum von mir dort einmal mitwirken zu d rfen
6077372 bridgestones participation in 200 formula one races shows the level of commitment we have given to the sport and we are delighted to be working with all of the teams and so many major motor manufacturers in our current position as official tyre supplier participating in a major sport brings us many benefits and in return we hope we have helped the sport grow just as we have grown through being part of formula one
6077373 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6077374 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6077375 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6077376 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6077377 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6077378 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6077379 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6077380 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here

6077531 that would be an issue his administration would have to face early because hes pledging to be a uniter not a divider without saying those exact words we campaigned on in 2000 hes pledging to change the way washington works and if congress were to pursue that it would be very divisive
6077532 that could be very problematic for his presidency right off the start
6077533 if you replaced existing lighting with solid state lighting following some reasonable estimates for the penetration of that technology based on economics and other factors it could reduce the amount of energy we consume for lighting by about one third that represents a 10 percent reduction of electricity consumption and a comparable reduction of related carbon emissions

6077559 gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur
6077560 its a terrible example to set for a young child promoting an industry that electrocutes animals snaps their necks and skins them alive
6077561 there is nothing feminine about inserting an electrode into the anus of a terrified and struggling fox and then electrocuting it ms paltrow is an actress and seemingly a particularly stupid one at that
6077562 gwyneth paltrow should be ashamed to promote something so steeped in animal suffering i can only assume that paltrow either is ignorant of the facts or lacks human decency and compassion
6077563 weve written to her many times and sent her videos showing how animals suffer for fur but have never received a response
6077564 animal rights groups are entitled to their opinion but many people do not share this opinion and it is certainly not reflected in the rising global demand for fur
6077565 regrettably not everyone understands the difference between animal welfare which has the full commitment of our sector and animal rights which seeks to ban every animal use by man whether for food medical or scientific research clothing or companionship

6077567 our findings provide the first evidence of mirror self recognition in a non mammalian species
6077568 they suggest that essential components of human self recognition have evolved independently in different vertebrate classes with a separate evolutionary history
6077569 a crucial step in the emergence of self recognition is the understanding that ones own mirror reflection does not represent another individual but oneself
6077570 mirror self recognition has been shown in apes and recently in dolphins and elephants using the mark test we obtained evidence for mirror self recognition in the european magpie pica pica this finding shows that elaborate cognitive skills arose independently in corvids the crow family and primates taxonomic groups with an evolutionary history that diverged about 300 million years ago

6077575 to suppose that the reactions are widespread in those social animals that form relationships based on individuality

6077610 ich muss den zucker perfekt eingestellt haben sonst ist der wettkampf gelaufen
6077611 ich habe keine ahnung wie ich den letzten versuch gemacht habe
6077612 das war ein krimi dieser wettkampf war an dramatik nicht zu berbieten
6077613 wir haben aus ihm erst mal einen richtigen gewichtheber gemacht
6077614 fr her ist er beim heben gesprungen jetzt hat er die richtige technik drauf
6077615 kennengelernt haben wir uns im alter von zw lf jahren beim leichtathletiktraining und wurden beste freunde
6077616 meine eltern sind zwar beide wie ich geh rlos aber meine gro eltern nicht sie zeigten mir wie man klavier spielt und brachten mir eine menge ber melodien und rhythmus bei
6077617 als teenager begann ich songtexte von alice cooper bis new kids on the blocks in geb rdensprache zu bersetzen vor sieben jahren meinte ein freund dass ich meine eigene musik machen sollte die wahl f r eine musikrichtung fiel mir nicht schwer da beim hip hop die meisten rapper sowieso viel mit ihren h nden arbeiten
6077618 den leuten gefiel diese au ergew hnliche mischung sofort sie waren alle davon fasziniert dass jemand mit geb rdensprache den text im rhythmus rappt w hrend ein anderer spricht oder singt
6077619 au erdem wurden wir schnell bekannt da wir in der ffentlichkeit ber die vor und nachteile eines ohrimplantats f r geh rlose diskutierten
6077620 unser erstes album war wie ein informationspaket ber geb rdensprache jetzt kennt in finnland jeder signmark und wir k nnen auch lieder mit anderen inhalten schreiben aber nat rlich werde ich niemals die geh rlosengemeinde vernachl ssigen
6077621 ich kann musik f hlen da ich als geh rloser wahrscheinlich etwas sensiblere sinne habe
6077622 nat rlich verwenden wir mit absicht tiefe vibrationen viel bass und starke rhythmen damit unsere songs nicht von einer melodie abh ngig sind denn melodien kann man leider nicht f hlen
6077623 die meisten besucher unserer webpage signmark biz sind deutsche mehr als 20 000 benutzer greifen jede woche aus deutschland auf unsere seite zu
6077624 es ist vollkommen anders als bei den anderen bands sobald wir ein grobschema bez glich des inhalts und der instrumente haben m ssen marko und brandon gemeinsam mit dem texten beginnen das braucht zeit denn die rhymes m ssen ja sowohl in der geb rdensprache als auch in der lautsprache genau auf den rhythmus passen und zeitgleich umsetzbar sein
6077625 wir wollen die menschen mit unserer musik zusammenbringen denn ich denke dass viele angst vor einer begegnung mit geh rlosen haben
6077626 aber angst kommt von unwissenheit und wenn man sich mit dem thema besch ftigt merkt man schnell dass das gar nicht n tig ist
6077627 mit kommt es so vor als w rden h rende und geh rlose in zwei strikt voneinander getrennten h usern leben beide gruppen sind f r sich in diesen h usern stark aber au erhalb unsicher und sie wissen nicht wie sie miteinander umgehen und reden sollen wir versuchen mit unserer musik menschen zu ermutigen auch au erhalb ihrer h user stark zu sein
6077628 es dreht sich alles um die akzeptanz heikki brandon und kim haben akzeptiert dass ich ein geh rloser mensch bin und wir wollen der welt zeigen dass wir trotzdem zusammen arbeiten und leben k nnen
6077629 ich habe mich zwei tage lang behandeln lassen und konnte nicht trainieren es h tte keinen sinn gemacht zur nationalmannschaft zu fahren

6077705 wed realized that our research was only really being shared with other academics and we wanted to put families at the centre of that process so they could view that information and then add to it based on their experiences
6077706 we had formed a face to face community of practice with participants from across the country and realized that an online community could really take this to the next level by making the information sharing and discussions happen year round
6077707 since rolling out our community of practice weve been able to create a real forum for sharing ideas discussing issues and more
6077708 the information we have is no longer sitting in a journal on a shelf it is being brought to life by the families it impacts and the people who do research on and make policies related to disabilities weve been able to take much of that research and produce more content and tools based on what is happening in the community ultimately this couldnt have happened without the creation of an online community of practice that members can access 24 7

6077719 the reason for this operation was to help prepare the crew for our upcoming deployment
6077720 the underway period went well as expected but i am really glad to be back
6077721 being underway was suspenseful and treacherous because we were practicing a lot of drills they really got to be monotonous but it is understood that if and when an emergency situation arises each sailor will be equipped with vital knowledge to help save the ship and crew
6077722 fuel prices appear to be squeezing room for other spending

6077733 he did not devote his full attention to duty i believe he was in violation of many other of our policies and those combined with the other allegations which will be forthcoming were enough information for me sunday night to make the decision to immediately separate him from employment
6077734 we give him the latitude to do what he thinks is the right thing to do with the cops

6077743 it was like living with jihad on a daily basis
6077744 im incredibly concerned that we did make an award to leeds community school over nine years ago and any allegation that funding weve given to any project has been misused and not used to change the lives of disadvantaged children and young people makes me concerned and very sad
6077745 i can reassure the public that we are very careful in who we fund and this allegation is a very rare one
6077746 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks in short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue
6077747 yesterday they said they had no problem with parliament opening and today they have a problem i have no comment on that

6077749 nothing can lessen the personal tragedy experienced by the two families who lost loved ones in these incidents their losses are made worse by the fact that in one case the external enquiry has failed to find any explanation
6077750 that is why the decision by the trust to convene an independent expert enquiry into the full range of maternity services is welcome the results of the enquiry are also encouraging in many respects
6077751 despite the two tragic deaths it is clear that antrim hospital and causeway hospital both have safety records which compare well with other maternity units across the
6077752 we were drunk and i was dressed like this so when the suits started showing up for dinner they asked us to leave

6077755 such a call is against righteousness a muslim should thank almighty allah if his children are healthy and if his married life is stable as the years pass by he should say alhamdu lillah for his generosity and kindness
6077756 it is normal for a son or daughter to celebrate birthdays they can invite their friends for a meal on this occasion i see nothing wrong in this
6077757 although he is a very learned scholar sheikh al oadah has made a mistake here
6077758 when we celebrate birthdays and wedding anniversaries we are imitating other religions something that our prophet peace be upon him warned us against
6077759 otherwise we will be falling in the trap of imitating others something that the prophet muhammad peace be upon him warned us against
6077760 we are prevented by islam to liken ourselves to the nonbelievers
6077761 singling out a certain day for celebration of such occasions every year is totally against islam
6077762 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will be confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention center
6077763 i would like to make music with somebody who makes really funky music
6077764 i want to do a collaboration with somebody who has really different styles than me i am not in a hurry to do that

6077766 i had never thought about it but mainly i sing i dont play guitar i dont play piano well i dont play instruments well so i started to do electronic music
6077767 from the beginning i have been using a sampler because i play everything but not very well so finally i cut into small segments and i sample my playing so it becomes cut and pasted it is like creating my live show in my apartment

6077772 i had written a song about what australia means to me i adapted it from an existing song i sent it to him because his name was in it he later invited me to his home and made me three cups of tea i sat there stunned
6077773 for the next 13 years i saw a lot of him and lady bradman and we became good friends music was the common thread in our correspondence
6077774 it came out of left field entirely i changed the lyrics slightly but i hope that in listening to it each australian feels he was a mate of don bradman not just me
6077775 some of the older bradman fans might squirm at me saying i was a mate of don bradman
6077776 three days later they broke up it wasnt our fault

6077782 this is by far the most exciting cast we have in over 13 years of shooting live action movies for command amp conquer
6077783 the caliber of the performances we received both individually and collectively have really raised the storytelling bar for the franchise we are really excited that we will be delivering such a high quality production that is on par with movies and television shows
6077784 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
6077785 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
6077786 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
6077787 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun
6077788 brand new dungeons and an arena mode that add exciting new dimensions
6077789 love is sufficient of itself it gives pleasure by itself and because of itself
6077790 the bridegrooms love or rather the love which is the bridegroom asks in return nothing but faithful love let the beloved then love in return should not a bride love and above all loves bride could it be that love not be loved
6077791 rightly then does she give up al other feelings and give herself wholly to love alone in giving love back all she can do is to respond to love
6077792 what then of the brides hope her aching desire her passionate love her confident assurance is all this to wilt just because she cannot match stride for stride with her giant any more than she can vie with honey for sweetness rival the lamb for gentleness show herself as white as the lily burn as bright as the sun be equal in love with him who is love no it is true that the creature loves less because she is less but if she loves with her whole being nothing is lacking where everything is given to love so ardently then is to share the marriage bond she cannot love so much and not be totally loved and it is in the perfect union of two hearts that complete and perfected marriage consists or are we to doubt that the soul is loved by the word first and with a greater love

6077840 i feel south africa are better equipped than england particularly when it comes to the bowling also the proteas are not no 2 in odi cricket for nothing just as england are not no 6 for nothing
6077841 the proteas havent had great preparation with a loss against the england b side and the twenty20 match being washed out
6077842 from an england point of view they still appear to be feeling their way as a one day side matt prior is suddenly back in the mix as wicketkeeper andrew flintoff is back after being out for a long time through injury and kevin pietersen is the new captain
6077843 pietersen of course is a big factor he has a superb odi record against south africa even better than his test record and captaining in the one day format is easier than in test cricket also the return of flintoff is a big plus for england he is their no 1 allrounder and the fact that he was out for so long with injury is one of the reasons they are ranked sixth in the world
6077844 jacques is mentally very tough and hell be ready to do his thing in the one dayers he didnt make many runs in the test series but he performed very well with the ball that is why he is so valuable to the team he can do it as a batsman and a bowler and he is a handy slip fielder as well his experience is also a big plus for the proteas
6077845 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
6077846 somebodys got to walk the line in the country theyve got to walk it unapologetically and im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
6077847 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals
6077848 and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation
6077849 it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform
6077850 i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance
6077851 leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia moore had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
6077852 tell him hes fucking amazing and i want to meet him
6077853 this event has been glossed over by the colonial government administration this has been kept under the rug for so long
6077854 what these people are seeking really is historical redress as those that were killed have for long been described as bandits and communist sympathisers
6077855 let us show our evidence and if we have proven our case then meet our demands if the outcome favours the british government then we will stop this protest
6077856 i have raised this with our foreign ministry and they will have to decide if it can be pursued further on a government level with britain
6077857 it was one of the toughest races ive ever done
6077858 this would definitely go down as my best win not only because it was history and my home ground but because i drove one of my best ever races
6077859 i want to dedicate this to my family because as you can see ive had some troubles over the last couple of weeks and its been really tough
6077860 but as always your family are there when you need them
6077861 its difficult to say its a work in progress were doing a good job and ive just got to keep building on it were in a good place now but theres a lot of competition
6077862 the last couple of weeks ive been flat out with working very hard just a lot of travelling many different things and different emotions building
6077863 ive had a couple of bad races and coming here i was just thinking it would have been nice to get some points and maybe a win i thought a one two would be possible
6077864 my minds always been right i just had a lot on my plate really its nothing too serious just life in general
6077865 some of my personal life working very hard just before the race i spoke to my brother and said i just hope i keep it on the track and he said dont worry about that youre a master in the wet that was great to hear that
6077866 the most overwhelming experience it took a lot out of me just to work out what was going on
6077867 to be honest the most draining thing was not wanting to let down the fans that whole build up
6077868 i see petrol dropping around r1 per litre or even more
6077869 we have a lot of land transport here while the big cities in europe have waterways
6077870 if the drop in diesel prices is the beginning of a trend then this would become important for inflation it would delay second round inflation fears
6077871 winter is coming in the northern hemisphere and the hurricane season only ends in november
6077872 depending on the demand supply situation i see oil at between 80 to 125 at the end of this year
6077873 for people to suggest that i and the il medical society so ils doctors were somehow in favor of withholding lifesaving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
6077874 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
6077875 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
6077876 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
6077877 porque de tal manera am dios al mundo que dio a su nico hijo jes s para que todo aquel que crea en jes s y en su sacrificio como paga del pecado del hombre no se pierda sino que tenga vida eterna
6077878 there are no get out clauses other than the fact we have to be at the suitable standard by that time
6077879 we have a plan we have the investment ready so we will be there
6077880 if were not ready in the same way that if anybody else wasnt ready then im sure bernie ecclestone would look to do something as he cannot jeopardise the grand prix
6077881 but as there arent any other alternatives we will be there at 2010
6077882 i think everyone will be surprised at how little needs to be done to get donington park ready to host a formula one grand prix
6077883 we already host the moto gp and host crowds in excess of 90 000
6077884 we have a track that is not far off from being suitable for f1 at the moment we only ran a grand prix in 1993 we have to build a new pit paddock and infratstructure
6077885 bernie has not invested some of the rumours of a wonderful fairy godfather out there with a big chequebook are slightly off the mark

6077893 from the nature of the human mind time is necessary for the full comprehension and perfection of great ideas that the highest and most wonderful truths could not be comprehended all at once by the recipients
6077894 that idea will in course of time expand into a multitude of ideas
6077895 the refutation and remedy of errors cannot precede their rise and thus the fact of false developments or corruptions involves the manifestation of true ones
6077896 a process of development the earlier prophecies are pregnant texts out of which the succeeding announcements grow they are types
6077897 that providence would therefore watch over his own work and would direct and ratify those developments of doctrine which were inevitable
6077898 the natural and necessary development of the doctrine of the early church and that its divine authority is included in the divinity of christianity
6077899 developments which are preceded by definite indications have a fair presumption in their favor so those which do but contradict and reverse the course of doctrine which has been developed before them and out of which they spring are certainly corrupt

6077903 in this war we must use all assets of national power to keep the pressure on the enemy keep the terrorists on the run and keep the american people safe from harm
6077904 americas future leaders must always remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and that is where americas military must stay
6077905 cannot be won however if we treat terrorism primarily as a matter of law enforcement law enforcement is an essential part of our strategy but our strategy cannot be limited to law enforcement alone
6077906 but eight years later al qaida terrorists came back to finish the job
6077907 what we know is that in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial they are currently in u s prisons incapacitated
6077908 and the fact that the administration has not tried to do that has created a situation where not only have we never actually put many of these folks on trial but we have destroyed our credibility when it comes to rule of law all around the world and given a huge boost to terrorist recruitment in countries that say look this is how the united states treats muslims
6077909 we could have done the exact same thing but done it in a way that was consistent with our laws
6077910 the enduring hostility to obama is reflected in a pew poll published last week showing that 18 of clinton supporters intend to vote for mccain with polling averages close to a dead heat between mccain and obama every vote counts

6077914 barack obama can use the words the american dream but they dont resonate
6077915 he magnified the problem by going to berlin and calling himself a citizen of the world

6077927 our sense of value and self worth is often tied to how much money we make
6077928 there is an illusion that we live with and believe that a bigger paycheck makes us happier and more valuable

6077933 esse jogo fora de casa muito dif cil a gente pega o internacional querendo algo mais no campeonato com o segundo turno apenas come ando as equipes querendo chegar e n s n o podemos pensar mais em perder pontos estamos a sete pontos do l der
6077934 d para fazer as duas coisas marcar bem segurar um pouco nos primeiros minutos e aproveitar o fato de eles estarem pressionados e sair para atacar
6077935 o nosso momento bom mas temos que mudar nossa postura fora de casa e o inter um advers rio bom para dar uma arrancada boa e atingir nosso objetivo maior que o t tulo
6077936 se a gente conseguir uma vit ria fora de casa quem sabe mudamos nossa hist ria no segundo turno se errarmos menos que o inter podemos vencer
6077937 preocupa onde estamos e n o conseguimos sair mas pensar no futuro n o adianta temos que ir passo por passo e temos um jogo mais do que importante contra o palmeiras
6077938 o chamado jogo encardido pois o n utico sabe que se perder cai ainda mais na tabela j que vamos super los em caso de vit ria
6077939 portanto eles entrar o como em uma decis o e n o podemos ficar para tr s n o podemos perder a concentra o um nico minuto caso contr rio a coisa complica
6077940 o n utico tem um time bom que j esteve por muito tempo na parte de cima da tabela e que n o vai aceitar passivamente uma derrota jogando nos aflitos l a press o grande a torcida joga junto e teremos que ter o m ximo de aten o n o vai ser f cil mas precisamos nos impor por ser um duelo de seis pontos
6077941 n o podemos aceitar passivamente a outra equipe jogando como se estivesse sozinha dentro de campo
6077942 tenho certeza de que contra o fluminense o n utico ser outro time jogando em casa e contando com o apoio dos nossos torcedores que n o podem faltar neste momento
6077943 me parece que es una acci n que si bien desde abril se ten a noticia causa sorpresa dado el car cter de las relaciones que el presidente calder n ha tratado de establecer con su hom logo el presidente hugo ch vez

6077949 initial tests have shown that network load could be reduced by a factor of five or more without compromising network performance
6077950 at the same time speeds are increased by about 20 percent
6077951 we think we have one of the most extensible rigorous architectures for making these applications run more efficiently
6077952 the project seems to have a momentum of its own
6077953 we realized that p2p networks were not taking advantage of the flexibility that exists
6077954 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
6077955 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
6077956 the big picture is we keep learning more about the contributions of environmental toxins to the chronic diseases of aging for which we never suspected an environmental cause
6077957 no i never really aspired to be a writer growing up but i was working in the union bank of switzerland and that kind of life is very hard with 12 14 hours at the desk and always someone younger and smarter coming up behind you so i thought there must be a better way to make a living i told my wife that i thought i wanted to be a novelist as i was a voracious reader so i quit my job and moved back to texas
6077958 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
6077959 typically when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy individuals to determine cognitive impairment
6077960 however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
6077961 we know that level of performance on tests of memory attention and executive function predicts dementia however this study showed for the first time that the degree of variability in performance across neuropsychological tests measured within a person improved the prediction of dementia above and beyond ones level of performance on each test alone
6077962 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period which on average was 3 3 years
6077963 this figure is in line with what wed expect for the incidence of dementia in this population
6077964 we are trying to understand the regulation of processes that are fundamental to normal cell development and health in humans
6077965 defective cilia are implicated in a wide range of serious illnesses such as polycystic kidney disease retinal degeneration and neurological disorders inappropriate activation of signaling molecules that normally reside at the primary cilium may lead to certain cancers
6077966 ciliogenesis is a fundamental process these structures are found in almost every type of human cell you can imagine
6077967 if we can ever design drugs that will restore the formation and function of cilia even in the presence of cep290 mutations then that would be one way to cure the defects that lead to ciliary diseases
6077968 it is a diagnosis that should not be used in anything other than a tiny fraction of cases in which it is made
6077969 my concern is that the adhd label carries more costs such as stigma than benefits for many of the kids to whom it is applied
6077970 it is a very complex issue that goes beyong the symptomology
6077971 if a child has been diagnosed with adhd a teacher may think they should be put in a special class they could be disadvantaged
6077972 hollywood sure as heck hasnt figured out how to represent the chinese canadian journalist
6077973 das ergebnis der b probe liegt aber noch nicht vor
6077974 we studied the properties of disease causing viruses that evolved to infect mucosal surfaces to engineer a coating that enables our drug delivery particles to penetrate mucus layers in minutes in our new work we have improved the coatings considerably to allow faster penetration for a wider array of particle sizes
6077975 for example we constantly inhale particles into our lungs but they typically stick to mucus rather than penetrate it particles that stick are removed rapidly from the lungs on a mucus conveyor belt and are swallowed and sterilized in the gut mucus barriers protect us from constant infection as well as everyday things like the millions of particles in the black cloud emitted from a bus when it takes off from a stop
6077976 if a particle is small enough and not adhesive then it can get through the mucus net thats how some viruses penetrate mucus barriers
6077977 peg is one of the most widely used polymers for therapeutic applications
6077978 for example cervical cancer patients could locally apply chemo drugs inside mucus penetrating particles which would then deliver the drug locally in the female reproductive tract at efficient concentrations over prolonged periods of time instead of delivering it everywhere else in the body that could drastically reduce the side effects as well as prolong the presence of drugs at the target site

6077988 i was driving us to the bear and wolf area when i saw a car stopped right in front of me
6077989 there was a bear in front of it so i stopped too and started taking pictures
6077990 i saw it take a hubcap off the car then start walking towards us i locked all the doors quickly we didnt know what it would do
6077991 it put the hubcap down and then banged on the window as if it was trying to get my attention
6077992 it was almost like it wanted to give me the wheel cap
6077993 my little boy was crying but my daughter was enjoying it she was saying oh my god mummy look what hes doing
6077994 quite soon after a park warden came along and shooed the bear away
6077995 she asked me whose the hubcap was so it could be returned to the car in front
6077996 it was very strange i dont know what the bear was doing
6077997 in a funny way i thought oh no maybe even animals are starting to take hubcaps as well as people

6078012 however if we dig deeper what we notice about white people is not if they have black friends but in fact how many black friends they have
6078013 this topic ties into a number of other posts but there is no denying that white people hate their parents what is amazing is that as a white parent there is nothing you can do to prevent this
6078014 it is imperative that you recognize how special and unique this white person is for knowing about your culture
6078015 white people also need ipods iphones apple tv airport express stations and anything else that apple will produce because you need to express your uniqueness by purchasing everything that a publicly traded company produces
6078016 a white persons ipod formerly cd collection is not merely an assemblage of music that they enjoy it is what defines them as a person
6078017 while white people enjoy venturing to ethnic parts of town to satisfy their pallette most would prefer to take their first dates and parents to a place with dimmer lights less water tanks with crabs and lobsters wishing that they would die less ducks hanging from the window and table cloths that arent plastic sheets
6078018 first it allows them to say oh this i got this shirt at goodwill for 3 this statement focuses the attention on the shirt taking attention away from the 350 jeans and 200 shoes the white person can then retain that precious indie cred
6078019 but the reason that white people love irony is that it lets them have some fun and feel better about themselves
6078020 most white people major in the arts and law school is pretty much the only option for anyone with a ba that wants a decent paying job
6078021 as 2007s indie hit it is alternative mainstream and white people love it when low budget movies do well even though the 7 million budget is enough to feed thousands of villages in east africa for a year
6078022 but like with anime you have to be careful about how much you like japan if you know how to speak japanese you kind of ruin it for everyone else
6078023 a good place to find white people on a saturday is at a bike shop bike shops are almost entirely staffed and patronized by white people
6078024 but it is essential that you reassert that poor people do not make decisions based on free will that news could crush white people and their hope for the future
6078025 these sandwiches generally start at 8 99 remember that whenever a white person says they wants to go to a sandwich shop you are looking at at least a 15 outlay after tip and drink 20 if the place has a good selection of microbrews
6078026 its likely that mychal bells high school football career is finished carroll football coach jackie hamilton said a compliance officer at the school mailed the paper work on monday for bell to go before the louisiana high school athletic associations hardship committee next week
6078027 but iraqs government is suspicious of such groups fearing their decision to break with the insurgency was a short term tactic to gain u s money and support the government fears they will eventually turn their guns against iraqs majority shiites
6078028 we had been to waddo geel where we held meetings with the residents on the de mining of that road when we reached arabsiyo centre we stopped to buy something in a shop and a truck nicknamed shambo hayran passed us
6078029 we then drove after it and when we tried to overtake it the people in it turned the truck towards our car forcing our driver hassan kosar to go off the road and hit some trees along the road
6078030 finally there was a third attempt by the same truck at about 12 30pm when it got to abarso 20km west of hargeisa this time the men came out and even slapped us around we chose to downplay the incident in order to save ourselves and we drove off
6078031 it gives me hope that its still moving forward its important to keep in mind however that there are two factions of the alliance for the re liberation of somalia there is the group in djibouti moderates who signed this document and theres another group hardliners if you will located in asmara eritrea who are not part of the process and the hardliners apparently control most of the al shabab militia units in somalia who are causing a lot of the problem in terms of security especially in mogadishu
6078032 it is i think a little bit unrealistic in a couple of points for example it calls upon the international community to move forward with humanitarian assistance in somalia and there certainly is a great need for that the problem is that the shabab component in somalia is continuing its attacks on the humanitarian workers and making it very very difficult to properly distribute humanitarian assistance in the country
6078033 even if that were to happen its many months away and timing is critical in terms of re establishing security in somalia and its even a question mark whether the united nations is in a position to come up with enough troops to make any difference whatsoever
6078034 it says all the right things the question is whether either the transitional federal government or this moderate faction of the ars is in a position to carry out those objectives and i think in some cases theyre probably not able to do that
6078035 pastoralists across east africa are starting to learn to live with the reality of climate change adapting as they can to its impact
6078036 they are not victims of climate change they suffer marginalisation more
6078037 we need to empower them pastoralists by formulating and implementing policies in their favour
6078038 governments in the region have historically had little economic and political interest in promoting pastoralists interests as they tend to see pastoralists as a
6078039 for the past century pastoralists in kenya have suffered the consequences of poor decisions taken by those charged with planning and decision making
6078040 many people say pastoralism is a livelihood which time has passed im happy that is changing
6078041 it is time we came together to address this issue of climate change now time is not on our side
6078042 there is a humanitarian crisis looming in northern kenya as pastoralists have resorted to eating wild fruits and gum arabica to contain hunger this is a community which has been self reliant on food as the majority of them were farmers
6078043 it is about time donors and government reconsider their strategies and empower pastoralist communities by directing funding support to pastoralists institutions

6078055 kempy has watched him out in russia this summer and likes what he sees
6078056 his judgement of a player is spot on so i have no problem trusting his opinion
6078057 he also knows what i like and what we need
6078058 he tells me hes quick and can play on either wing although hes only 22 hes had plenty of experience so he seems well worth taking a chance on
6078059 hes a player weve known about for a while and weve become aware he might be available
6078060 hes a pacy winger which is something we havent got
6078061 he had a work out with the lads and looked very quick
6078062 its difficult to say how he would do in games because its different playing in the premier league than it is in russia

6078087 kumud sharma of the centre for womens development studies in new delhi traced the correlation between education and domestic violence to patriarchal attitudes
6078088 they are no longer willing to follow commands blindly when they ask questions it causes conflicts which in turn leads to violence in many indian states working women are asked to hand over their paycheck to the husband and have no control over their finances so if they stop doing so or start asserting their right there is bound to be friction

6078093 they are not going anywhere we signed them because they are good players and the fact that duncan has left the team doesnt mean that they will also leave the team
6078094 i am happy with the boys i am proud of them too they played well and i am confident that ambrose vanzekin will keep a clean slate in the final
6078095 im excited i just want to play again and its great to be with my home team with so many talented youngsters coming through
6078096 monday james and chibuzor okonkwo are our players and we are happy they have delivered for nigeria as far as the games are concerned
6078097 besides okonkwo scored a beauty of a goal against belgium i thought that goal was the goal of the match and i hope nigerians agree with me
6078098 we know that the hope of nigerians to win the soccer gold medal is on us and we can not afford to let millions of nigerians down with the ceaseless prayers of nigerians to this team and god on our side we wont disappoint
6078099 there is no pressure on the team for now and the spirit in camp is very high the boys have assured us that they will rise up to the occasion and make nigerians proud
6078100 although there is much pressure on me and samson siasia because of volume of work that only the two of us have been doing but we are encouraged with the performance of the boys that has also given us enough strength to cope with the volume of work on ground
6078101 best ogedegbe too has been in touch from nigeria we have been discussing and planning team strategies together he has not relented in his own contributions
6078102 we will parade the best crop of players in the final against argentina and i am sure we will win the match all the players are fit and raring to go
6078103 the coach called me and the captain aaron mokoena into a meeting in london where he outlined his vision to the 2010 world cup

6078106 its an honour for any player to be selected to be part of the south african national team
6078107 we have to be positive we have a bright future and the way we played against a good team like australia showed that we have talent and direction
6078108 what we need now is the enthusiasm of the people of south africa the remaining qualifiers are important and are going to be tough and we therefore need the support of all south africans

6078127 i want to assure you that we will continue working together and tirelessly for the success of these games
6078128 after a sports council was formulated in the mid 1980s to serve as the directory of sport in this country a department of sports in the office of the president was initially created for this and also a commission of inquiry into the state of sport was established
6078129 this commission of inquiry gave birth to the sport and recreation commission which recommended the hosting of the annual games called the zimbabwe national youth games
6078130 the process of organising these youth games met several stumbling blocks including lack of capacity at all levels inadequate financial resources and lack of infrastructure development
6078131 i observe that this is the sixth edition of the youth games which means that each province must develop better skills to manage the games
6078132 there should an improvement in way provinces manage transportation of athletes accommodation feeding and overall organisation of the games
6078133 the exploits of kirsty coventry peter ndlovu cara black and kevin ullyett among others bear testimony to the power of sport to unite the nation

6078150 i have stepped down as head coach at masvingo united with immediate effect
6078151 i have failed bring the desired results at the club despite trying and i hope a new broom is now needed to sweep better
6078152 as i reflect i want to thank all the fans executive players and stakeholders for the support given to me over the years
6078153 its sad that i have to leave the team in such a precarious position on the log but i am confident that our colourful club will survive
6078154 we played badly against caps united and they were all over us
6078155 i take the blame as the coach for the poor results because i have my own shortcomings as a human being but there are a lot of things happening in the background
6078156 these events outside the field of play make our operations as coaches very difficult
6078157 there is a very limited pool of players at masvingo and the club needs to recruit more but this is not happening
6078158 i do not understand how a club can sell their best player karuru and yet fail to get replacements
6078159 in football one man does not make a team but with the creativity of such a player it was better

6078216 there is an absolute recognition for years and years and years that there has been a labour crisis and a shortage in this electorate
6078217 none of the endeavours that have been put in place have resolved it my growers deserve a fair go
6078218 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions
6078219 its clearly been identified that there is a gap and we need to fill that
6078220 what brendan nelson doesnt understand is we have fruit rotting on the vine we are actually talking about a serious labor shortage
6078221 these are not full time jobs these are seasonal jobs and if to some limited extent we can help australias farmers with seasonal labour then its a sensible thing to do
6078222 we were backing all this up regularly using a tape library with eight lto tape drives

6078271 charging more for parking will simply displace potential customers elsewhere where it costs less to park
6078272 mr healeys comments go completely against his own departments ambition to regenerate and attract people to urban centres
6078273 the real effect will be to drive customers away reducing the viability of those businesses in town centres
6078274 local businesses often object to parking charges but the car park that is constantly full because it is too cheap is not bringing custom to local shops
6078275 these proposals are diabolical in respect of enabling local high streets and local businesses to survive we found that where high streets are surviving there is free parking
6078276 parking restrictions can be extremely damaging to local economies and ultimately counter productive as shops in town centres begin to close

6078284 but for all the unease over the kill switch concerns over how apple may use iphone subscriber data may be misplaced industry experts say apple isnt alone in monitoring the applications used on its phones carriers keep close tabs on whats being downloaded onto users handsets mobile software retailer handango regularly removes offending games and utility applications from its site if they appear to infringe on another companys copyright we have to do this all the time says handango ceo bill stone

6078307 inflation was likely to move further above the governments 2 0 percent target in the coming months the outlook for activity growth had continued to worsen but some build up in the margin of spare capacity was likely to be necessary to ensure that inflation returned to the target in the medium term

6078438 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6078439 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6078440 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
6078441 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
6078442 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
6078443 teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics
6078444 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
6078445 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
6078446 most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment it gets the kids back in class it doesnt disrupt instruction its like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems
6078447 it works on some and it doesnt work on others
6078448 if youre one of the individuals that it does work on yes it will become a deterrent
6078449 i dont think its the schools place to make decisions like that
6078450 im not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either but i feel like if somebody makes that decision it should be the parent

6078455 state law prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination extends to the medical profession

6078528 in a recent interview with reid in his opulently chandeliered suite in the capitol i ask why the democrats had not used their majority in the senate to close the hedge fund loophole he greets the question with dead silence when he finally speaks he tells me something i never thought i would hear from a democrat that it would be wrong to single out the nations wealthiest investors simply because they are bilking the treasury out of billions the only difference between hedge fund operators and other folks similarly situated reid argues is that they make more money what reid also failed to mention is that the real difference between hedge fund billionaires and others so situated is that they are the ones underwriting efforts by the democratic senatorial campaign committee run by schumer all told the hedge fund and private equity sectors have showered the democrats with more than 14 million this year double what they have given republicans

6078600 obviously these companies want doctors to prescribe the medicines theyre marketing
6078601 we want doctors to make their decisions based solely on their best medical judgment rather than the best interests of pharmaceutical manufacturers
6078602 they knew things about my prescribing habits that i didnt know myself
6078603 what we do have are organizations using this as a platform for their own political agendas
6078604 by selling data that allows pharmaceutical sales representatives to see which doctors are prescribing which drugs the ama is giving drugmakers what they need to exert more influence
6078605 what weve done has served the public extraordinarily well over the last decade but the reality is that cost has become an issue

6078611 and i was the dummy that read every one of them
6078612 since da boob was 85 sure it was a fake does this mean he has only 42 5 of brain

6078619 it was a nail biter that could have gone either way
6078620 we are talking about the possibility of really creating a great real world class park here on the waterfront
6078621 we have enormous activity and potential on our waterfront in new york today and we have the chance to build a great 21st century public work
6078622 if we have a park we have the ability to maintain and protect it
6078623 hotels draw people in housing requires a private quiet neighborhood
6078624 im not in favor of housing in the park but im not willing to risk the park not being built by opposing the housing
6078625 the housing does in fact take up a much smaller footprint than anything anyone else was trying to think of
6078626 it was one of those nights when i wore a supertight dress that you couldnt have worn anything under since it would have showed the paparazzi were literally lowering their cameras like speculums when i got out of the car
6078627 on the way home i said to my husband darling i think they might have gotten it and so when we pulled in i made him re enact the thing with his camera a sort of crime scene run through it appears i survived unscathed
6078628 house work want hurt you but why take the chance
6078629 i live in a sizeable house and thats one of the reasons i had to fit the stove
6078630 with most stoves you put some wood in and you get a nice little fire but as soon as the flames gone down the heat disappears
6078631 but a tile stove works as a storage heater because there is a great mass of masonry inside which heats up and radiates heat through the tiles
6078632 you wouldnt play a college soccer game there not to mention a professional game
6078633 first for one game only the crew would make the field 62 yards wide
6078634 since theres a high school football game the night before they could just leave the lines on the grass and use the football field instead of the mls anthem they can play circus music as the teams walk onto the field during the game it will be non stop jock jams and public address announcements the scoreboard clock can count down and if they still have the thing the crew could even put that old shootout clock behind the north goal
6078635 the crew could put a large butter sculpture of bruce arena out on the plaza a butter bruce would be very good entertainment for middle america
6078636 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
6078637 we have two more weeks until the end of the transfer window and i think this will be the most important week
6078638 i read alex fergusons statement that he wants another striker and i hope that this striker is dimitar berbatov
6078639 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
6078640 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
6078641 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
6078642 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
6078643 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
6078644 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
6078645 i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is
6078646 you hear little whispers and with the form that rio has been in and what man utd have achieved i did think he would get it
6078647 rio has been in great form for manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job
6078648 the manager said he takes control of all the tactics and all those big decisions and its my job to keep the players moving forward
6078649 when things are going smoothly its easy to run but when you have a defeat or people arent playing its my responsibility to keep these players happy and keep things moving forward
6078650 borja is very happy that everything has gone through and sees this as a great opportunity
6078651 we are barring entry to paul francis gadd and will be deporting him to his home country england unconditionally and even if he does not wish to board the plane

6078653 whether or not you are participating in a credit counseling of any kind
6078654 im hoping to do at least one but if i could get two it would give us some security
6078655 there will also be loans but i would prefer tried and tested ones rather than ones for the future
6078656 its a little weird for them i guess but everyone grows up
6078657 an explosion in demand for farm grown fuels has raised global crop prices to record highs which is spurring a dramatic expansion of brazilian agriculture which is invading the amazon at an increasingly alarming rate
6078658 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago
6078659 this continues the weaker picture seen in june and points towards the more subdued levels of lending we are likely to see in the second half of 2008

6078667 im surprised that that kind of money that kind of incentives doesnt produce better results it sort of undercuts the argument that the problem is the question of motivation
6078668 im just dumbfounded that they can regard this as an achievement or as a great improvement or as something worth spending the money on
6078669 im surprised that that kind of money that kind of incentives doesnt produce better results it sort of undercuts the argument that the problem is the question of motivation
6078670 while growth sustains towns it can lead to disastrous results without the awareness of an empowered citizenry with a strong identity

6078678 here i have to reveal a trade secret which punctures the mystique of intelligence analysis generally speaking 80 of the information one needs to form judgments on key intelligence targets or issues is available in open media
6078679 in his usual form former un weapons inspector scott ritter told a packed crowd to stop whining about corporate media and become their own intelligence operatives we the people have the same resources and tools that intelligence networks rely heavily on its called google as our own intelligence operatives we cant allow cnn fox nbc and abc to edit and cherry pick information but ask questions and find the answers ourselves
6078680 many apparently separate developing daily events dont make the slightest sense if you dont look at them in their strategic context in the face of orwellian control of the media it is even more necessary to judge contemporary developments with the eye of an historian who has not forgotten the lessons of history

6078687 if i died and you remarried and she lived in this house would she sleep in our bed
6078688 that bed is brand new we just paid 2 000 for it its going to last a long time so i guess she would
6078689 if i died and you remarried and she lived in this house and slept in our bed would she use my golf clubs
6078690 how the welfare state robs americans of money and spirit
6078691 the federal government shall not adopt any policies that transfer income resources from some americans to other americans
6078692 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
6078693 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6078694 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6078695 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6078696 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6078697 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6078698 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6078699 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6078700 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6078701 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6078702 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6078703 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6078704 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6078705 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6078706 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6078707 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6078708 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6078709 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6078710 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6078711 i have not heard a dickie bird from middlesbrough they have gone nowhere near him i couldnt say if anyone will come in for any of my players before the deadline
6078712 there are still two weeks to go and it may be that if a couple of premier league clubs have some bad results then they may decide to do something but realistically i cant see it
6078713 youve got a lot of places around the planet where the only access to the digital content out there is through a notebook and a wireless card we have a significant opportunity
6078714 thats pride fucking with your head fuck pride pride only hurts it never helps
6078715 you go into some of these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and no things replaced them and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
6078716 they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
6078717 well ya know the president of united states is just a figurehead for the government
6078718 the fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of reverend wrights sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour in american life occurs on sunday morning
6078719 america is like the uncle who molested you as a child but paid for you to go to college
6078720 sil y a un endroit ne pas manquer cest la maison des n erlandais tout le monde veut y tre cest l que tout se passe
6078721 we lost one guy at a truck stop on the way back to nashville and we didnt realize we lost him till about a hundred miles out from home
6078722 wed left him like 800 miles out from home and he had hitched a ride with a trucker and headed to nashville and caught up to us
6078723 he got off in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom
6078724 and when you get off a tour bus you need to put something in the drivers seat thats the code
6078725 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6078726 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6078727 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6078728 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6078729 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6078730 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6078731 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6078732 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6078733 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6078734 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6078735 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6078736 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6078737 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6078738 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6078739 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6078740 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6078741 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6078742 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6078743 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6078744 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6078745 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6078746 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6078747 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6078748 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6078749 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6078750 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6078751 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6078752 depressing climate of disrespect for the security of our personal information
6078753 the government is collecting more and more information about us but seems utterly incapable of keeping it safe
6078754 we will ensure only essential data is stored and that proper systems are in place to prevent its loss or misuse
6078755 available to new and existing customers our new products give borrowers the peace of mind that their monthly payments will remain the same for the next two or five years regardless of what happens within the wider economy
6078756 whats more they offer borrowers a choice as theres a selection of rates and arrangement fees to best suit their needs
6078757 the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on with it as quickly as possible
6078758 but whether that will harm local fisheries is an open question humans may have to adapt as well
6078759 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6078760 you know you dont choose your family but you choose what church you want to attend
6078761 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position and if he was a woman he would not be in this position he happens to be very lucky to be who he is and the country is caught up in the concept
6078762 any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this campaign down and says lets address reality and the problems were facing in this world youre accused of being racist so you have to shut up
6078763 racism works in two different directions i really think theyre attacking me because im white hows that
6078764 beating on the press is the lamest thing you can do it is only because of the utter open mindedness of the press that hillary can lose 11 contests in a row and still be treated as a contender
6078765 what are you trying to do with this blog thing
6078766 isnt there something pathetic and embarrassing about this emphasis on shade
6078767 if you were more discerning you d probably buy this book if you do read this book you will be this book on discernment is simple clear well written and well illustrated
6078768 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6078769 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6078770 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6078771 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6078772 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6078773 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6078774 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6078775 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6078776 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6078777 es ist ein hohn wenn die regierungsparteien einander nun die schuld an der nichterh hung der sterreichischen entwicklungszusammenarbeitsleistung zuschieben sterreich hat immer noch keinen plan wie bis 2010 die erh hung auf 0 51 prozent des bne zu erreichen ist daf r werden pro jahr 2009 und 2010 je etwa 400 mio euro n tig sein die bundesregierung unter f hrung eines sp bundeskanzlers hat es str flicherweise vernachl ssigt hier zukunftsweisende schritte zu setzen
6078778 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6078779 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6078780 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6078781 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6078782 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6078783 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6078784 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6078785 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6078786 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6078787 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6078788 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6078789 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6078790 langsam wachsen sich die wasserrohrbr che in wien zu einer plage aus
6078791 hierbei haben wir es mit einer serie von wasserrohrbr chen zu tun die ihre ursache nicht in zuf lligkeiten hat sondern anscheinend in einer beralterung des wasserrohrnetzes in wien
6078792 es wurden zwar immer wieder rohrauswechslungen im umweltausschuss beschlossen aber den beteuerungen diese w rden reichen um das wiener wasserrohrnetz sicher zu machen k nnen wir angesichts der pannenserie nicht mehr den entsprechenden glauben schenken
6078793 f r die erf llung unserer forderung m sste eigentlich genug geld da sein erwirtschaften doch die wiener wasserwerke im jahr 2007 einen berschuss von ber 54 mio euro
6078794 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6078795 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6078796 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6078797 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6078798 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6078799 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6078800 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6078801 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6078802 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6078803 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6078804 the idea is to get the defense on its heels for a second
6078805 sometimes thats enough to get the ball out of the quarterbacks hands for a pass or gives the line another second to block for the run
6078806 there are a lot of things that are asked of us that we didnt do in the last couple years our fakes then were just token fakes they werent intended to try to deceive people thats not the case now thats why we run so many nakeds and bootlegs after every play it cant be a lost art with us
6078807 what we are doing requires the offensive line the running backs everyone has to make it look like something its not
6078808 there are probably one or two guys on the defense that read us the quarterback for keys the others are reading the guards or tackles or the back to make it work takes 11 guys doing the same thing
6078809 we arent trying to hide it we try to do everything the exact way every time we dont want there to be a difference they can detect thats one thing i watch on film when i do hand offs or when i do a naked i want to do them the same way
6078810 if you oversell it they are going to know somethings up and if you undersell it they are going to know you try to always make it look the same
6078811 einstimmig und mit gro er freude hat heute der parteivorstand unsere au enministerin ursula plassnig zur spitzenkandidatin f r die nationalratswahl gew hlt ich freue mich dass diese prominiente kandidatin f r k rnten ins rennen geht

6078825 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6078826 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6078827 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6078828 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26

6078837 a verdade que este filme insistia em n o me sair da cabe a um pouco como aconteceu com
6078838 e isto mais uma vez essencialmente devido sua atmosfera algo que agora um bocado dificil de explicar a quem ainda n o viu o filme
6078839 revela se numa obra especial e com muitos bons motivos para agradar a quem procura uma hist ria de amor diferente
6078840 tem um lado po tico e bonito na forma como usa as cores da cidade para ilustrar a rela o dos dois protagonistas por outro tem tamb m momentos intim stas extremamente frios e algo perturbantes que parecem at deslocados do resto do filme
6078841 num filme que n o se esquece especialmente se gostarmos de hist rias de amor originais e bem contadas
6078842 t o diferente que at a pr pria m sica n o aquilo que se esperaria mas mais uma vez isto contribui para tornar o filme numa hist ria de amor especial que merece ser vista pelo menos uma vez
6078843 apesar de breves contribuem tamb m para aquele estranho equilibrio entre cinema de autor cinema comercial e para a originalidade do filme
6078844 conta a hist ria de uma rapariga que depois do namorado ter morrido de uma rara doen a gen tica mesmo assim n o consegue deixar de o amar
6078845 at capaz de merecer mais mas a verdade que a estranha indefeni o entre estilos de cinema lhe retira muito da for a que merecia ter tido
6078846 poderia at ser um daqueles filmes obrigat rios assim fico me apenas pelo muito recomend vel mas recomend vel mesmo pois uma excelente alternativa a todos os outros filmes do g nero rom ntico oriental que tenho recomendado at agora

6078869 i didnt ever think id have a movie career i always thought id be a theater actress and so just the idea now that ive gotten to play so many different roles im really having a blast doing that
6078870 my general broad thing that i look for when im choosing a role is i like to be the exact opposite of what was the last thing i played
6078871 shes the one whos willing to do more extreme stuff i think shes attracted to more provocative material
6078872 she just took that role and made it her own it couldve been something she did passively it couldve been something she kind of phoned in but she got into it a lot of the physicality of it a lot of the way she was moving and talking that was all her
6078873 shes also just cool in between takes i found her at the crafts service truck eating grilled cheese and smoking cigarettes talking to the grips
6078874 it was cool hes playing someone whos so immature and when you meet her mary kate she seems really wise and it was also three in the morning and so we were just like ah lets get it over with

6078891 the citroen family moved to paris from amsterdam in 1873 five years before andr s birth upon arrival the diaeresis was added to the name changing citroen to citro n a grandfather had sold lemons and had changed the consequent name limoenman lemon man to citroen lemon
6078892 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6078893 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6078894 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6078895 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6078896 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6078897 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6078898 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6078899 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6078900 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6078901 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6078902 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6078903 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6078904 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6078905 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6078906 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6078907 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6078908 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6078909 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6078910 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6078911 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6078912 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6078913 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6078914 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6078915 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6078916 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6078917 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6078918 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6078919 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6078920 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6078921 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6078922 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6078923 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6078924 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6078925 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6078926 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6078927 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6078928 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6078929 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6078930 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6078931 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6078932 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6078933 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6078934 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6078935 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6078936 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6078937 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6078938 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6078939 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6078940 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6078941 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6078942 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6078943 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6078944 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6078945 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6078946 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6078947 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6078948 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6078949 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6078950 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6078951 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6078952 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6078953 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6078954 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6078955 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6078956 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6078957 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6078958 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6078959 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6078960 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6078961 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6078962 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6078963 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6078964 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6078965 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6078966 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6078967 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6078968 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6078969 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6078970 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6078971 this is a planning took where all things are going
6078972 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6078973 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6078974 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6078975 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6078976 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
6078977 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6078978 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6078979 people are going to be looking at the gasoline numbers
6078980 just as the market overshot to the upside it overshot the other way
6078981 i think credit markets need to improve in the u s before we see a sustained rally in the dollar
6078982 we may have hit a top for the dollar i dont think this rally can last
6078983 write blessed are the dead who die in the lord from now on
6078984 they will rest from their labor for their deeds will follow them
6078985 see i have taken away your sin and i will put rich garments on you
6078986 because you have seen me you have believed blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed
6078987 at that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom
6078988 at midnight the cry rang out heres the bridegroom come out to meet him
6078989 then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps the foolish ones said to the wise give us some of your oil our lamps are going out
6078990 no they replied there may not be enough for both us and you instead go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves
6078991 but while they were on their way to buy the oil the bridegroom arrived the virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet and the door was shut
6078992 later the others also came sir sir they said open the door for us
6078993 but he replied i tell you the truth i dont know you
6078994 therefore keep watch because you do not know the day or the hour
6078995 for i am jealous for you with a godly jealousy for i betrothed you to one husband so that to christ i might present you as a pure virgin
6078996 therefore keep watch because you do not know the day or the hour
6078997 again it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his property to them
6078998 after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them the man who had received the five talents brought the other five master he said you entrusted me with five talents see i have gained five more
6078999 his master replied well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful with a few things i will put you in charge of many things come and share your masters happiness
6079000 the man with the two talents also came master he said you entrusted me with two talents see i have gained two more
6079001 his master replied well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful with a few things i will put you in charge of many things come and share your masters happiness
6079002 then the man who had received the one talent came master he said i knew that you are a hard man harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed so i was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground see here is what belongs to you
6079003 his master replied you wicked lazy servant so you knew that i harvest where i have not sown and gather where i have not scattered seed well then you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers so that when i returned i would have received it back with interest
6079004 take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents
6079005 when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory
6079006 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world
6079007 then the righteous will answer him lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink when did we see you a stranger and invite you in or needing clothes and clothe you when did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you
6079008 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
6079009 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
6079010 they also will answer lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you
6079011 he will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
6079012 then they will go away to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life
6079013 blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed
6079014 im really impressed stuart combated his fears to do this
6079015 our judeo christian principles dictate that we do what we can to help people who are oppressed throughout the world
6079016 the judeo christian values that they hold are the strength of america
6079017 it is a judeo christian values nation and its an obligation we have and we are not doing it
6079018 hey anyone know whos organising the office 2 0 conference
6079019 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6079020 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6079021 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6079022 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6079023 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6079024 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6079025 the u s customs and border protection bureau wants shippers to collect 10 new categories of data for u s bound cargo 24 hours before its loaded on ships in foreign countries
6079026 eso es una realidad a la que no se puede permanecer indiferente pues la base de igualdad de la justicia est siendo fulminada
6079027 conlleva la nulidad de la prueba de alcoholemia como soporte de una condena
6079028 la realidad dibuja una actuaci n administrativa desviada de sus fines los de controlar y preservar la seguridad vial que si de verdad preocupase se intentar a tambi n preservar respecto al conductor que circula drogado o afectado por otras sustancias
6079029 y tenga la desgracia de ser pillado con el estricto ndice legal
6079030 pueden inundar nuestras v as con la seguridad de no ser detectados
6079031 the first summer our objective was to find the color for the shit that would later be called tang i thought the stuff tasted horrible but gf thought they could sell it and i worked on the color
6079032 in lay terms our readers probably dont understand a lot about chemistry can you describe what you did
6079033 we spread out the drinks in different colors all the way from least colorful to most
6079034 so we went back to the lab and came up with even brighter colors and back to
6079035 the blacks picked the nuclear orange and the taste tests went the same around the rest of the country
6079036 we were so proud when nasa picked tang as the beverage to send to the moon
6079037 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6079038 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6079039 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6079040 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6079041 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
6079042 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6079043 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6079044 delphi 2009 and c builder 2009 will be available on aug 25 with north american pricing beginning at 399 per license for professional editions 1 299 for enterprise editions and 2 299 for architect editions
6079045 de grens tussen mens en machine is aan het vervagen ik kan mij laten troosten door de televisie ik heb vaak het gevoel dat clairy polak en bij mijn leven horen ik voel een menselijke betrokkenheid hoewel ik best weet dat het maar televisie is ik heb ook gevoelens bij mijn persoonlijk ingerichte mobiele telefoon en mijn laptop ik kan kwaad worden op mijn computer dat kan ook bij een robot als die s ochtends een kopje koffie voor je zet of dingen voor je optilt krijg je daar warme gevoelens bij en de robot kan ook nog leren hij kan zich realiseren dat je boos bent door de klank van je stem en zich dan voortaan anders gedragen dat is een heel menselijke interactie
6079046 we groeien naar elkaar toe wij konden ons twintig jaar geleden niet voorstellen dat iedereen overal en altijd bereikbaar zou worden nu vinden we het iets vanzelfsprekends de mens is voortdurend in interactie met zijn omgeving en als die omgeving deel wordt van het mens zijn verander jij als mens ook als je een bril opzet en daardoor scherper ziet ben je een ander mens we lijven technologie in en daardoor worden we andere dingen en de robot zal op zijn beurt steeds meer op ons gaan lijken alleen al omdat hij door mensen geprogrammeerd wordt
6079047 floridi ziet de mens als een informatie organisme maar dat is een bijzonder beperkt begrip van wat mensen zijn als je in de mens meer ziet dan een informatieverwerkend ding dan is het maar de vraag of die versmelting van mens en robot berhaupt plaats kan vinden veel mensen gaan ervan uit dat het een kwestie van tijd is voordat de verschillen tussen mens en machine verdwijnen maar de antropologen onder de filosofen zeggen het is principieel onmogelijk dat mensen ooit gelijkwaardig worden aan robots omdat mensen een identiteit autonomie en zelfbewustzijn hebben zaken die je niet kunstmatig kunt opwekken ik deel die intu tie maar besef wel dat deze opvatting onder druk staat
6079048 veel aspecten van ons gedrag die we tot voor kort zagen als hoogst individuele eigenschappen blijken nu in hoge mate voort te komen uit neurologische en genetische factoren door onze eigen robotachtige programmering we zijn veel minder vrij dan we dachten
6079049 ik vind het geen prettige gedachte maar ik sluit niet uit dat er in de toekomst nog minder van onze vrije wil overblijft en als we ons eigen bouwschema nog verder doorgrond hebben zou het in principe mogelijk moeten zijn om gelijkwaardige robots te cre ren waarmee we ook gelijkwaardige relaties zouden hebben
6079050 waarom in de klassieke techniekfilosofie wordt technologie tegenover de mens gesteld techniek roept vervreemding op en ontmenselijkt in de hedendaagse filosofie is die tegenstelling verlaten het idee dat mens en ding totaal verschillend zijn is achterhaald iemand als wetenschapsantropoloog bruno latour behandelt dingen en mensen als twee niet van elkaar te onderscheiden actoren
6079051 er zijn zelfstandig wonende bejaarden die via een webcam 24 uur per dag een gesprek kunnen hebben met een verzorger dementerenden krijgen een robot in de vorm van een knuffelzeehond dat draagt eerder bij aan een gelukkige samenleving dan dat we er een onmenselijke wereld mee cre ren
6079052 als een kunstmatig denkend knuffelzeehondje een dementerende gezelschap kan houden dan is daar niets op tegen maar ik vraag me wel af of het ook een gelijkwaardige aanvulling is op menselijke aandacht het feit dat dergelijke zeehondjes zo succesvol zijn zegt meer over de tekortkomingen in onze menselijke relaties dan over de kwaliteit van die robotjes
6079053 robots zullen nooit een vervanging maar altijd een aanvulling blijven maar waarom zou je alleen van mensen of dieren mogen houden en niet van dingen je houdt toch ook van je boeken je meubels je huis de wereld gaat ten onder als mensen alleen maar van mensen mogen houden
6079054 zolang er nog redenen zijn om te geloven dat er een vrije wil bestaat hecht ik er zeer aan om aan dat concept vast te houden als het element waarmee de mens zich van dieren en dingen onderscheidt
6079055 de mens zal altijd graag in de illusie willen geloven dat hij degene is die de robot aanstuurt
6079056 de mens stuurt ook aan in deze context verwarren wetenschappers vrije wil nogal eens met willekeur
6079057 ze plaatsen een randomfunctie in het brein van de robot ze zorgen ervoor dat de robot af en toe afwijkt van zijn patroon en ineens iets anders doet en dan zeggen ze hij heeft een eigen wil
6079058 maar een randomfunctie leidt tot een totaal onbepaalde grillige handelswijze dat is zo ongeveer het tegenovergestelde van de menselijke vrije wil het vermogen om een bewuste keuze te maken en daarnaar te handelen
6079059 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
6079060 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
6079061 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
6079062 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6079063 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6079064 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6079065 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6079066 ein viertel der zugriffe auf netdoktor at erfolgt in den foren um pers nliche erfahrungen zu tauschen
6079067 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
6079068 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
6079069 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
6079070 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
6079071 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
6079072 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
6079073 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
6079074 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
6079075 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
6079076 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
6079077 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
6079078 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6079079 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6079080 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6079081 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6079082 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6079083 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6079084 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6079085 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6079086 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6079087 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6079098 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6079099 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6079100 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6079101 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6079102 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6079103 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6079104 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6079105 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6079106 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6079107 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6079108 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6079109 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6079110 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6079122 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to have everyone who works in politics in one place
6079123 itll be a rare opportunity to have such hands on work between googlers and users
6079124 in terms of general interest around the election were only seeing it grow
6079125 the online component will hopefully make the convention a bit more personal and a bit more on demand
6079126 politics has been the top news category on yahoo news for six straight months so theres no question were seeing a strong interest in it
6079127 yahoo is in a much different position to provide deeper coverage of the convention than we were four years ago
6079128 these are partnerships we didnt have and we werent getting the video coverage like this four years ago
6079129 we do consider our technical support and expertise were providing to the conventions our first priority in helping them put on a first rate convention

6079195 its a long time since i won two races in a row it means we are back in business and back on pace
6079196 it has been a difficult period for the team but now we are so strong
6079197 we are now at the top of the championship so we must stay concentrated and have more wins like this
6079198 i had quite a lot of pressure because angel was waiting with the special leathers to join me on the bike so i really needed to win
6079199 im going to smile because we must celebrate this and not pay attention to the pain
6079200 all my body is in pain but im so happy
6079201 it was a difficult and very aggressive race but i was determined to stay on the bike
6079202 theirs is an operation that everyone will be studying for campaigns to come
6079203 obamas success online is as much about how our society has changed how our media ecology has changed just in the past four years
6079204 in one afternoon my dad is reaching friends who in the past would have taken him a whole year to be in contact with thats not necessarily obama thats the internet
6079205 but you have to give credit where credit is due obamas internet team is doing a hell of a job taking advantage of all these changes theyve basically leapfrogged not just the clinton and mccain campaigns but also the mainstream media when it comes to reaching their supporters
6079206 i like to say that we at the dean campaign were the wright brothers
6079207 this is not an extra chair this chair belongs to
6079208 early on we wanted to capture the sense that this campaign is not just about obama
6079209 i like how obama always says blacks whites spanish asian
6079210 he says all the races so you can see that hes not focused on one group of people
6079211 i guess ive kind of been rebelling from my cnn days where video had to be a certain length a certain format with a certain sensibility where i came from theres a lot of concern about ratings and about what they think people everyday people are interested in watching
6079212 here we dont worry about how many views our videos get thats not the priority one of our goals is to get people talking about whats going on in their lives and why theyre supporting barack and hopefully not only will they watch the videos but also comment on them and forward them to relatives and friends and co workers
6079213 but i have about eight strong volunteers probably closer to 10 strong volunteers
6079214 we dont have control over what people think of the videos we just put them out there
6079215 to me texting is the most personal form of communication
6079216 your phone is with you almost all the time youre texting with your girlfriend youre texting with your friends now youre texting with barack
6079217 watch barack debate tonight live on cnn 7pm edt reply back with your name and your thoughts during amp after the debate
6079218 please reply to this message with your five digit zip code to receive local obama campaign news and periodic updates
6079219 south carolina was a defining moment in what we were going to do with text messaging not just with young voters but with all voters
6079220 help barack get out the vote in pennsylvania if you can get to pa between now and 4 22 reply to this msg tvl and your name ex tvl ann please fwd msg
6079221 some people only go to myspace its where theyre on all day some only go to linkedin our goal is to make sure that each supporter online regardless of where they are has a connection with obama
6079222 then as much as we can we try to drive everyone to our site
6079223 as great as barack is if the campaign hadnt been constituted in this idea of investing in our everyday supporters and helping them organize among themselves i wouldnt have been as excited about the job
6079224 making sure the events are happening as planned that the hosts have resources that they count how many people actually show up
6079225 we were able to build a state by state organization during the primaries because of the internet
6079226 now we have to continue building on that in addition to making sure we keep getting our message across and asking our supporters to help us debunk any rumors and lies out there
6079227 that way women are calling other women people who list the environment as their top concern reach out to people who do too
6079228 i wanted to be a part of the campaign instead of just writing about it
6079229 you can see the main difference between the obama and mccain campaigns by going to their web sites
6079230 go to mccains pretty standard looks fine but go to obamas at the very top theres a quote
6079231 im asking you to believe not just in my ability to bring about real change in washington im asking you to believe in yours
6079232 because of the internet obama has built a movement hes leading a cause mccain is running on his r sum hes leading a campaign
6079233 now whats going to win a cause or a campaign we dont know

6079246 we are thrilled to be collaborating with jewishgen an elite and well respected resource in the jewish genealogy community

6079249 the impact on the genealogy community will be significant not only will genealogists now have the use of powerful search tools to make research easier they will be able to find everything for their jewish heritage research needs at one location
6079250 the continuity of jewish heritage is central to the museums mission we are pleased that this partnership will make it easier for users to discover their jewish roots and connect or re connect to their familys history
6079251 most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection
6079252 this essential treaty has languished in limbo for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
6079253 because most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources
6079254 this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
6079255 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
6079256 the test its self is made so that even the master jesus could not pass it
6079257 i neveer claimed i bend it with my mind i used my mind to bend the spoon the hands did the bending
6079258 go in your drawer and pick out 10 or so spoons and lay them out on the table use your feeling and let them tell you which spoon will bend
6079259 when you feel you have the right spoon and sic mind you pick one that is fairly thin to start out with
6079260 the hands did the bending but the mind helps you bend
6079261 are you an expert in the field are you a lawyer
6079262 thats not real or ill break your face cause what you saying is fake
6079263 there are no laws in the universe but what man has made and teached to others
6079264 there are no laws in the universe but what man has made and teached to others
6079265 why do you have to touch the spoon at all
6079266 if the earth is flat why cant anybody show me the edge
6079267 the mccains own eleven houses and spent over 200 000 on household staff in 2007 so i suppose he can afford tens of thousands of dollars in gambling losses every year at the same time you wouldnt want someone to enjoy playing against the odds with the countrys public policy the fact that mccain seems to think theres some kind of betting strategy that can turn craps into a winning game also raises some questions about his math

6079274 while the grant program had great motives initially to reduce the local tax burden it has not worked out that way
6079275 our position will remain the same on the homeowners tax relief grant we need to keep this grant intact so that georgias homeowners are not affected any further in this current economy
6079276 have never approached it from the standpoint that they have to tighten their belts
6079277 this is politically nuclear for legislators and policymakers and people who want to be elected to office
6079278 but its the facts its true i will defy anyone to refute the statement that its been ineffective in helping to lower property taxes
6079279 it has been a supplement to local governments theyve taken their tax revenues plus the grants and continue to grow their governments
6079280 there is no way we can stick that money in our budget without giving it to taxpayers
6079281 i dont think our spending has been out of line
6079282 he perdue understands clearly the house and the senate and the basic republican philosophy that you dont get rid of tax relief in down times because all that does is depress the economy and you get less money flowing into the government
6079283 i am unequivocally against getting rid of the tax relief
6079284 hopefully i go down there and go 5 for 5 in my first game and show i am ready

6079291 a lot of things we put in place for the convention will live on after people stop thinking about the delegates
6079292 were happy to be a catalyst to make these things happen
6079293 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and western philosophies but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico

6079298 i urged him to move ahead in the israel syria negotiations as much as possible so that whoever is the next president would not start from too far down the track
6079299 i did not say anything about obama or mccain i said whoever is the next president is not going to want to inherit a process that isnt going anywhere
6079300 there was no hesitation on the part of foreign experts to say whats needed is to improve the rule of law including independence of the judiciary there was a little bit of push back from the syrians but there was a debate among the syrians
6079301 none of us thought we were being used or abused
6079302 not only to raise awareness on legal issues but also to assist members of the legal profession in syria in the development of contacts and links with lawyers in other parts of the world
6079303 senator obama values the expertise of ambassador kurtzer but he is not a paid adviser nor is he authorized to conduct talks with any government ambassador kurtzers trip was part of an aba delegation on legal reform and had no connection with the campaign
6079304 the british syrian society is closely connected to the family
6079305 official unofficial syrian intellectuals to come to washington and lobby on behalf of the regime
6079306 but its not a secret that the syrians are openly banking on barack obama its not surprising that they would build bridges in advance and do this through the window of the peace process
6079307 if one of senator obamas advisers has been to damascus we just wonder how many have been to tehran
6079308 thats ridiculous of course no advisers have been to tehran

6079310 we completely support russia georgia sparked the crisis yet the west accuses russia
6079311 the war initiated by georgia was a extreme attempt to encircle and isolate russia as the americans continue their cold war policies
6079312 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis
6079313 and if before in russia there were people who thought these forces can be friendly then now i think no one thinks that way
6079314 the significant military assistance provided by israel to georgia in its war against russia will affect in the future and probably in the near future ties between russia and israel and russias attitude toward arab states
6079315 russia will re examine its ties with israel and it is not unlikely that moscow will now decide to increase its military assistance to arab countries in conflict with israel including syria

6079332 namun hanya cerita kalau istri saya sering digoda dan dilecehkan oleh keponakan majikan bahkan diperkosa hingga hamil kami sendiri berharap nursiyati segera pulang karena anaknya yang kedua sering sakit sakitan
6079333 kami juga mendesak pemerintah mengupayakan secara hukum agar nursiyati bisa bebas dan menjamin pemenuhan hak yang mesti diterimanya pemerintah juga harus menindak pelaku yang menempatkan nursiyati ke arab saudi

6079371 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money

6079375 theres a huge pressure on beds there are huge demands on the system
6079376 what were seeing is that patients are sicker theyre more acute theyre more medically unstable but theres continuous pressure to get patients admitted treated and out
6079377 if we had more supportive housing for people with long term mental illness it would free up a significant number of the beds that we would say are blocked
6079378 it indicates to me that theres a changing way that hospitalization or stays in a hospital are being used for people with a mental illness
6079379 patients with social anxiety should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term
6079380 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
6079381 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
6079382 i would have liked to see it go much slower
6079383 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
6079384 those getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk
6079385 you can only study a vaccine for so long before you license and use it in a population where it has enormous value
6079386 our hope and belief is that this is a remarkable vaccine that will have huge impact on women
6079387 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
6079388 some of our provinces are running out of money to provide primary care im not against vaccines but in canada and the u s women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer
6079389 this initiative was seen as a good use of resources that fits with the governments health priorities and political priorities
6079390 if we do this quickly and badly we could cause more deaths
6079391 when you get a letter saying this is what you need to do to protect your girls of course you do it
6079392 i chose to get vaccinated because my dreams dont include cervical cancer

6079426 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6079427 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6079428 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
6079429 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralises their potential benefits
6079430 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolising enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs

6079450 ian g paisleys psychopathic outburst amounted to incitement to murder republicans of course the british crown forces already have a long history of murdering republicans on sight but there was always continuity in resistance to british rule the british forces of occupation have no right to be in ireland let alone to employ the use of lethal force on irish soil or against irish citizens resisting their presence
6079451 whether mr paisley likes it or not the republican movement is growing and will continue to grow attacks such as the one in lisnaskea can be ended through a complete british withdrawal from ireland

6079454 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6079455 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6079456 of course the british crown forces already have a long history of murdering republicans on sight

6079488 because chinese researchers receive much smaller paychecks than their western counterparts shanghai based wuxi is able to lower the cost of this research
6079489 we have often heard major western pharmaceutical companies complain of the extraordinary cost of discovering and developing drugs
6079490 more costly than the laboratory infrastructure is the burden of paying for armies of highly trained highly paid chemists researchers analysts and physicians wuxi has become the secret weapon of many big name global pharmaceutical companies
6079491 china educates tens of thousands of engineers chemists and technologists and outsourcing that expertise has become a growth industry wuxi became a leader in this trend in 2000 and has gone on to attract an impressive roster of clients
6079492 the firms senior management team consists of ph d s and mbas with experience in drug and medical device r amp d wuxi management has more than 200 patents pending or granted and has published more than 800 scientific publications
6079493 wuxis u s based facilities are all fda registered including a 63 000 square foot facility in st paul minnesota a 46 000 square foot testing facility in atlanta and a 75 000 square foot facility in philadelphia
6079494 wuxis china based operations provide services to more than 80 pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers including nine of the top ten pharmaceutical companies
6079495 each of wuxis top 10 customers over the last three years continues to be its customer today a fact that speaks well of the firms skill effciency and respect for intellectual property
6079496 for the first quarter of 2008 wuxi reported q1 revenues were 69 higher than revenues for the same quarter a year ago at 57 1 million the big winner was laboratory services a division that saw its revenues rise by 77 to 38 5 million
6079497 the shares have plummeted since the companys 2007 ipo along with a general retrenchment in the shanghai composite index which fell from unrealistic highs this made wuxis post ipo blues worse than usual additional pressure was added by rumors of an upcoming secondary offering
6079498 the company has delayed indefinitely plans for a secondary offering while world markets remain turbulent meanwhile with its heady increase in earnings wuxi is attractively valued with a pe multiple of 22 2 were calling this company a buy up to 20

6079507 agilizar al m ximo como siempre ha hecho la actividad legislativa en el parlamento valenciano
6079508 da la impresi n de que el se or luna est m s preocupado por hacer l mismo el debate antes del congreso del partido socialista que por que se celebre el propio debate
6079509 lo que tenemos claro en este momento despu s de las afirmaci nes del portavoz del grupo socialista y no del conjutno del partido socialista es que quiere que se celebre el debate de pol tica general antes del congreso
6079510 parece razonable que de acuerdo a lo que ha pedido el partido socialista que no ha aceptado la propuesta del pp de que el debate se celebre el 30 de septiembre
6079511 est dispuesto a llegar a un acuerdo con el pspv
6079512 ya cinco candidatos que se presentan a la secretar a general del pspv dos de ellos diputados de estas corts
6079513 ahora pida que se convoque con celeridad una mesa de les corts por la situaci n econ mica cuando el presidente del gobierno jos luis rodr guez zapatero ha tenido que ir arrastrado por todos los grupos de la oposici n a comparecer precisamente sobre algo que l dec a que no exist a y estos mismos d as estamos viendo c mo el se or zapatero se quiere escaquear de ir hablar sobre financiaci n auton mica al congreso de los diputados
6079514 absolutamente bochornoso que un representante de un partido pol tico diga que la responsabilidad de la crisis en espa a es de estados unidos y de lo que ocurra en el exterior que eche la culpa de la crisis de las familias valencianas y de las familias espa olas a que una persona no pueda pagar una hipoteca en wisconsin o que haya problemas en las plantaciones de maiz de brasil
6079515 tenemos la inflaci n m s alta el paro m s alto y el d ficit comercial m s alto de la zona euro y somos el pa s que est sufriendo en mayor medida la crisis por parte del conjunto de pa ses de la uni n europea
6079516 en estos momentos en la comunitat valenciana un gobierno est tomando medidas para asumir la situaci n econ mica y para afrontar esa crisis que es el gobierno de francisco camsp con 1 400 millones de euros destinados a pol ticas productivas a nuestras pymes nuestras familias l neas de cr dito inversi n productiva y en definitiva a generar las condiciones para salir adelante de esta situaci n
6079517 somos cinco millones de habitantes y el gobierno zapatero s lo financia a cuatro millones
6079518 es necesario que de una vez por todas el pspv diga
6079519 el reconocimiento de un mill n m s de habitantes en la comunitat
6079520 1 000 millones de euros m s para financiar la sanidad la educaci n y los servicios sociales y que dejen de marear la perdiz
6079521 the sims 3 collectors edition som lanseres samme dag gir en helt spesiell sims opplevelse til lojale spillere
6079522 informar a todos los ciudadanos valencianos y a los turistas que visiten la comunitat sobre todo lo relacionado con el mundo de la f rmula uno as como sobre los atractivos tur sticos que ofrece la comunitat para que se contagien de su esp ritu
6079523 retar n a los transe ntes m s intr pidos a una carrera urbana por las plazas m s emblem ticas de valencia
6079524 en el pueblo se sufri algunos da os sobre todo cristales de veh culos rotos o alg n golpe en la chapa
6079525 no es la primera granizada de este estilo que se registra en la zona puesto que la semana pasada hubo una granizada muy fuerte que caus da os incluso a infraestructuras este martes por suerte no fue durante mucho tiempo a pesar de que la tormenta dur toda la tarde
6079526 por suerte la tormenta de este martes no ha afectado a los cultivos de la zona
6079527 con el objetivo de demostrar que detr s de estos actos existe una actividad econ mica muy positiva para los valencianos
6079528 ventana de proyecci n de valencia al mundo de lo que somos y de lo que podemos ofrecer
6079529 es impagable lo que el mundo va a poder ver de valencia durante estos d as
6079530 se potenciar al mundo una imagen de la ciudad espectacular que se podr a comparar con el montecarlo del siglo xxi
6079531 la f rmula uno supone para la comunitat no s lo una proyecci n internacional de gran calado sino una inyecci n de beneficios para los ciudadanos
6079532 no ser tampoco algo para despreciar ya que cerca de 500 millones de espectadores son los que siguen cada una de las pruebas del campeonato de f rmula uno una cifra que es equiparable a los juegos ol mpicos o al campeonato mundial de f tbol
6079533 los grandes eventos se traducen en empleo desarrollo y crecimiento ya que por cada mill n de euros invertidos por la generalitat se genera otro mill n de renta en la comunitat
6079534 la renta generada en esta comunidad por la inversi n de un mill n de euros es de 978 840 euros
6079535 ayudan a potenciar algo tan importante en nuestra comunitat como es la realidad tur stica
6079536 ese turismo tanto de sol y playa como de interior
6079537 se ha convertido en un elemento muy dinamizador de la econom a de valencia que se puede potenciar a n m s con los grandes eventos
6079538 ayudan a reducir el impacto que ha sufrido la econom a por la crisis econ mica porque potencia la creaci n de empleo y repercute en la econom a de los ciudadanos y en su bienestar
6079539 no pueden perder tiempo a la hora de desempe ar el papel que nuestro marco estatutario les ha conferido
6079540 en la medida en que nos afecta las econom as de la uni n europea y de los estados unidos aconseja de los poderes p blicos el seguimiento permanente de la evoluci n de una circunstancias r pidamente cambiantes y la adopci n de medidas frente a las mismas
6079541 lo que procede es que cuanto antes nos pongamos todos a arrimar el hombro
6079542 de verdad quiera hacer alguna cosa m s all de criticar al gobierno central
6079543 tiene competencias en materia de planificaci n econ mica industria comercio servicios
6079544 hemos asistido a un rosario de comparecencias del presidente de la generalitat y de los consellers
6079545 n mero contradictorio y confuso de cifras que no tienen nada detr s
6079546 no pone ni un euro nuevo sobre los presupuestos aprobados para afrontar la crisis econ mica
6079547 no pone nada nuevo encima de la mesa porque no puede recurrir a la deuda no genera nuevos ingresos sino todo lo contrario y porque no va a establecer ning n nuevo impuesto que le permita tener dinero fresco
6079548 recortar en los sitios en los que se despilfarra y apretar la clavija
6079549 es uno de los centros que m s deuda ocasiona al gobierno de la generalitat
6079550 si no sabemos c mo se gasta el dinero no responden a las preguntas que les hacemos
6079551 no publican los datos que ponen encima de la mesa dif cilmente vamos a poder colaborar
6079552 todo el mundo tambi n deber a saber lo que cuestan y lo que producen
6079553 con un nuevo alegato del pp en forma de proposici n no de ley contra el gobierno de zapatero
6079554 seguir profundizando en el an lisis y las posibilidades de llegar a alg n tipo de acuerdo
6079555 que claro que lo reconoce y s lo hay que irse
6079556 actual modelo de financiaci n que aprob el pp no permite la actualizaci n de la poblaci n
6079557 siempre tiene un portavoz en les corts valencianes en este momento soy yo y dentro de un mes puede ser otro pero eso no tiene nada que ver con los criterios de pol tica general que tenemos muy claros
6079558 no condicionamos la respuesta pol tica a la situaci n interna del partido
6079559 est dispuesto a arrimar el hombro en una situaci n complicada

6079591 he has previously been of good character and behaviour and he worked hard in the army and left of his own volition he had a good service record
6079592 this is a man who deserves a chance he is not a stranger to hard work he is someone who could benefit himself and society from a community disposal
6079593 the amount of tablets found where they were found the place you intended to supply them a nightclub all make it more serious
6079594 it appears they were waving to the police car going down union street the bike becomes stationery and a pedestrian comes from the footpath to stop the bike and is quite violently kicked
6079595 it is not clear which one but appears to be the male in the middle
6079596 the passengers were gesticulating on the bike in a triumphant manner
6079597 it hits the side of the car then hits the pedestrians
6079598 the police were at the scene very quickly because they were there for the torcher parade
6079599 there appears to be one person trapped under the bike
6079600 did the person driving it have control and no one else

6079602 community driven news represents an important facet of the dailyme experience so weve been seeking a more meaningful ranking of stories that goes beyond simple popularity ultimately the news stories that matter most to us are those that trigger an emotional response whether insightful or tragic humorous or uplifting by launching meme it we are acknowledging the emotional nature of news and allowing users to share their own responses with the entire dailyme community
6079603 our programming students have found the curlwbt to be a very useful tool as it provides them with easy real time access to knowledge of the curl language and platform
6079604 while we have discovered that the students already familiar with java find it easy to learn curl the web based training courses make that process even simpler and faster
6079605 the curlwbt was created to provide developers with the necessary tools to get up to speed on the curl language and technology as quickly as possible
6079606 we are excited to make this available to the entire curl developer community as it really showcases how easily curl can be used to build enterprise class rich internet applications
6079607 she saw a dark colored car speeding away from the scene and then notified police
6079608 when i first heard about the possibility of being allowed to protest i was very happy my issue could be resolved but it turned out all to be cheating i feel stuck in my heart
6079609 what the two old ladies did is nowhere near that
6079610 we are a communist society with the people the leaders and owners but basic citizens rights cannot even be realized today how sad it is the way things are is the opposite of the people oriented ideology of the country when it was founded
6079611 punishing wu and wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates that the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones as well as the permit application process were no more than a show
6079612 im going to be responsible all right for partying till my nuts catch fire
6079613 playing a perfect game for any team i think is impossible
6079614 were playing a fantastic team and were going to have to play well but were excited
6079615 were going to have to stay tight as a unit play as a full team once again stay compact and know where they are at all times
6079616 shes made some really big saves for us it seems like every game she makes an amazing play shes definitely one of our strong players and well need her in the final im sure
6079617 im excited that the league is coming back i think its going to do well no matter what because the u s is ready for another league
6079618 im excited for it because im a product of the old league to be able to have our national team coaches go out locally and see great games and find some new players to keep the tradition of the u s national team top ranked thats great
6079619 it is unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
6079620 he said it was his job even after he got his orders that he was going over there he said its his job
6079621 he loved me i loved him and id give anything to have him back
6079622 i see petrol dropping around r1 per litre or even more
6079623 we have a lot of land transport here while the big cities in europe have waterways

6079625 do you ever think youll write about a girl character
6079626 dont tell me anything about the game or i will go back to back stage
6079627 see kochan is always like that no matter how many pose i changed he still not going to move
6079628 i want to spent time with my boy friend during year end
6079629 oh yea before i touched too many time to the point my hands really hot a few more of touches my hand will go into flame
6079630 i never been praise by johnnys san before on concert stage never praise me before in a cute stupid voice
6079631 sorry its quiet nervous to play drum in dome lets try again
6079632 actually i have time you guys didnt see secretly crying but i pretend its sweat and wipe it off
6079633 its good to be alive even today i have several time thinking so
6079634 well as you keep on giving those guys gift i just give you to them then
6079635 i went into the lift dont know why suddenly so want to go to toilet but then while i am busting the door cant open
6079636 i am not toilet and if i become toilet no one will be on your right side
6079637 but you will be the only one who mock a toilet tho
6079638 oh my god are the 52 stairs a hint that they will raise their standard to 52 xd and oh gosh when will it be 21 anyway xd not to far cough cough
6079639 im a lowkey person and i just want to make some tunes
6079640 because everyone is used to calling it m8 we stopped using the minione name
6079641 out of all the various sorts of digging experiences my favourite one must be to dig through a personal collection
6079642 ive been lucky enough to be a part of jungle drum n bass from its conception first as a raver then a producer
6079643 ive seen it when its been at its best and worst and even though it sounds cliche drum n bass back in the early nineties was when it was at its most innovative for me we were being taken seriously as a musical genre famed musicians were amazed by what we were doing i dont think we even realized what was going on i think the tunes back then had a quality that couldnt be denied and to this day they still stand out
6079644 since ive been going solo ive had this fear of my music not being played by djs because it didnt seem to conform to some standard that had been established in the scene ive done loads of tracks over the years that havent seen the light of day cos id finish it and think whats the point in giving this out no ones gonna play it i even had some djs confirm this with comments like i love it i just cant play it this frustrated me for a long time i wasnt sure where i stood anymore
6079645 so i found myself going through old tunes that used to hurt me so much i had to listen back to what it was i found so good about drum n bass and why tracks like krust future unknown the arrangement and string section in that tune physically pains me so heart wrenching ed rush and opticals use of brooding tones and melancholy keys matrixs drum patterns dillinjas ability to fuse dark and light these are just some of the things that influenced and inspired me from within drum n bass it was listening back that allowed me to move forward and realize that making dnb and music was never meant to be about pleasing anyone but myself you can only hope people like and get what it is youre doing
6079646 im a gemini first off also i have a running theme through my work which is connections
6079647 the gemini principle is driven by the compelling need to connect objects with one another to form ever greater links their job is to experience a diversity of sensations thoughts and encounters so that they can create systems or theories of knowledge that are then disseminated to others
6079648 o assunto n o trata de privil gio decorrente da lei de anistia mas disciplina a o de natureza imprescrit vel
6079649 havia tr s turmas de tortura na rotina do doi codi elas se revezavam a cada 8 horas para garantir a perman ncia das torturas durante todo o dia e toda a noite
6079650 eu tamb m estava arrebentado ent o eles n o se importaram comigo e trouxeram ele para minha cela para fazer o teste de reflexo vieram fizeram o teste de reflexo no joelho e n o tinha resposta nenhuma
6079651 depois que fecharam a porta merlino come ou a piorar muito logo em seguida noite come ou a se sentir mal estava bem pior eu n o me lembro dele ter comido nem uma vez porque ele tentava comer e vomitava sangue a ele come ou a mudar a ficar nervoso falou que estava piorando vomitou sangue outra vez eu tentei acalm lo ele pediu que eu o colocasse sentado merlino nunca ficou em p desde o primeiro dia para ir a privada precisava carregar ele eu e um guarda bem eu tentei acalm lo comecei a dizer a ele para respirar fundo fazer a respira o de ioga manter um pouco de calma mas ele ficou muito nervoso e falou chama o enfermeiro r pido que eu estou muito mal a dorm ncia est subindo est nas duas pernas e nos bra os tamb m a eu bati na porta com for a e gritei e vieram o enfermeiro e alguns torturadores policiais os mesmos que j haviam me torturado e torturado a ele tamb m vieram e o levaram
6079652 1973 um torturador da opera o bandeirante organismo da repress o que antecedeu o doi codi tamb m comandado por brilhante ustra oberdan cismou de falar comigo sobre merlino n o morreu como voc s pensam foi para o hospital passando mal telefonaram de l para dizer que ou cortavam suas pernas ou morria fizemos uma vota o ganhou deixar morrer eu era contra estou contando porque sei que voc s eram amigos
6079653 destas pessoas que ficam para sempre gravadas na mem ria de quem as conheceu por mais que passem os anos o que o levou a tomar a decis o que tomou e lhe custou a vida foi simplesmente um sentimento de dever uma tica um compromisso com os companheiros de luta por isto que a mem ria dele continua t o viva e presente n o s no brasil mas tamb m na fran a e em outros pa ses em que se conheceu sua hist ria a heran a que ele nos deixa a de seguir lutando para que nunca mais o brasil conhe a a opress o a viol ncia policial a tortura

6079657 mit diesem spiel wollen wir gezielt fu ballfreunde ansprechen und unser enga gement rund um die awd arena sowie unsere sponsoringpartner st rken
6079658 this is tight edgy impossibly cool material from an artist and label that we expect very big things from killer
6079659 this is a tough one to get your arms around
6079660 what you dont see are the issues that go on at the schools videotaping of the special education kids that gets put on the web inappropriate pictures kids fighting and harassing each other over text messages theres also an issue of safety at schools around the country police havent been able to communicate with one another because of all the outgoing cell phone calls jamming the frequencies
6079661 id like to be able to confiscate the phone for the rest of the year after the third offense but we cant legally do that
6079662 im sorry but a three day outdoor suspension is a vacation
6079663 and are we really going to suspend an elementary school child for bringing in a cell phone or video game
6079664 if it gets that far after meeting with the parents then there is a problem to begin with
6079665 but we dont view suspensions as a vacation any more we connect our suspended students at the high school and the middle school with the juvenile resource center which they are required to attend during that time they are required to do their school work and make up credit hours
6079666 ive certainly had instances of fifth graders taking pictures with cell phones
6079667 ive had to have meetings with parents but ive never had it go as far as needing to take disciplinary action if i did i couldnt see it being more than a one day suspension in school with supervision
6079668 if they are in afterschool programs or activities theyre still in school
6079669 i understand that kids need to make calls for rides home but while theyre in school they always have access to a phone
6079670 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
6079671 playing two wingers should have the advantage of making it a big open game
6079672 we played that way for 90 per cent of the games last season away from home
6079673 we played 4 3 3 at crystal palace and beat them that was my plan to play the same way when we lost to them here
6079674 we did the same at burnley and won that game playing 4 3 3 and playing really well that day
6079675 but in the main we play 4 4 2 and had a decent away record last season
6079676 so the answer is yes we can play as good and as devastating away from home
6079677 wardy was the best of them in that position in pre season he had a great pre season and was outstanding
6079678 he really has been terrific since his injury and he trained really well on monday
6079679 but jarvo was always going to play at home on
6079680 thats the beauty of it id like to have two players as good and as competitive as that in every position because wed have a really good squad
6079681 this can and should be the moment in which the roman catholic church in the united states can and should assume its rightful role in the culture forming task of constructing a religiously informed public philosophy for the american experiment in ordered liberty
6079682 the cultural and political assumptions of the catholic church in the united states have largely failed
6079683 the american catholic witness to the gospel partial and unsure
6079684 credible alternative to a way of life that every day seems to grow more remote from the christian ideal
6079685 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
6079686 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
6079687 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
6079688 for those of you who know nothing about borja valero i can tell you that he is a
6079689 but thats not a criticism as there are very few players in world football with the quality of those two and he is only young
6079690 his ideal position is in the centre of a midfield with at least one but preferably two defensive midfielders playing behind him
6079691 however like arteta he is also an option out on the right hand side of a 4 4 2 not as a winger but
6079692 hes not a player who will run with the ball like a winger but he can hold on to the ball when required and he will open up defences
6079693 it represents a very exciting signing for west bromwich albion a club ill certainly be keeping an eye on this season as i love their manager and their brand of football
6079694 as a product of the youth system at real madrid he comes with a very solid grounding in the game and an excellent footballing education
