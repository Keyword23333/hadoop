7190000 those decisions will be made at the end of the year in terms of how many changes you can make to your list and where that takes you
7190001 brisbane and coach leigh matthews have done a similar job up there theyve remained competitive since their four grand finals 2001 04
7190002 were the two teams in those northern states where its very hard to bottom out but those decisions will be made at the end of the season
7190003 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7190004 thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows every conductor on that amtrak train to wilmington
7190005 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7190006 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7190007 over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgment intelligence and steel in his spine
7190008 ive watched as hes inspired millions of americans to this new cause and during those 18 months i must tell you frankly i have been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and gave in to the swift boat politics he once so deplored
7190009 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the united states of america joe biden
7190010 had to use physical force to transfer mathes to the less harsh cell environment
7190011 its generally a problem thats anxiety based where a child gets anxious at the idea of going to school it may manifest itself in a physical way stomach pains leg pains
7190012 generally the childs fear is real and the symptoms are real
7190013 many people use the term without the clarity and correctness of what it really is
7190014 he was rolling around on the floor in pain he was losing weight rapidly
7190015 when i saw him i said oh no this isnt a school phobia
7190016 floyd is glad she went with her gut emergency room workers found polyps on her sons colon
7190017 they get fed up they get frustrated and they dont want to go to school theyre tired of being last in the class of being ridiculed
7190018 he was so fearful and would shake so badly that the assistant principal would have to physically remove him from my car and take him to class or to his office
7190019 his first grade teacher would notice his whole body tremble as she asked for his homework
7190020 i was just that program was made for texas a amp m we have an extremely strong military tradition here with the corps of cadets it is in our fabric
7190021 to get my gear i wound up going to about 30 different companies
7190022 but i want to see how else i can help out
7190023 theres more to supporting your troops than putting up a little decal
7190024 i believe its my responsibility to make sure other soldiers are ok
7190025 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7190026 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7190027 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7190028 of widespread armed conflict very high threat of terrorist attack against western interests
7190029 westerners have been targeted and killed in terrorist attacks throughout somalia including mogadishu foreigners including australians have been kidnapped
7190030 in my heart i believe that he will say yes
7190031 if there is in principle support from the australia government we would form working groups to look at how many people and where
7190032 i believe the prime minister would be very keen to see some east timorese workers come and assist us with the mango harvest
7190033 getting people to work getting people an education getting skills is the best defence against a further uprising in timor leste
7190034 we need to find ways where we can have a win for east timor provide some support there as well as fill a need here
7190035 however we must never reduce our effort to bridge that gap from welfare to work here
7190036 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7190037 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7190038 you can see from this tournament how we need to upgrade the level of the judges
7190039 that experience is going to make this experience that much better
7190040 the last couple of weeks if you had asked me that i would have said i cant wait till its over ive mixed feelings
7190041 its obviously been a long association and i have had some fantastic times
7190042 this year has been a nightmare but i guess if you put it in with all the great times ive had then its not so bad
7190043 but this year has been extremely frustrating and disappointing its nobodys fault its just one of those things that happens in sport all the time
7190044 i thought jamal idris made a terrific debut he showed hes a good first grader of the future
7190045 his first 20 minutes was fantastic the pace of it caught up with him a little bit i think and he started cramping 15 to 20 minutes into the second half
7190046 but he certainly showed his strength and his speed and he can certainly jump and catch the ball
7190047 whether he stays there in first grade or not its hard to say but certainly on that performance you would think he would be there next week
7190048 he played well i thought he handled the step up pretty good and he was a handful
7190049 i thought they played particularly well probably the best theyve played for a long time
7190050 if hes available well play him but i cant say hes available ive got no idea
7190051 hes one of our best players and knowing what he knows and who hes going to draw well weigh it up
7190052 were not going to expose players who arent right but if its an anthony rocca whos coming off a long term injury and hes available to play well then thats one of the things youd be pretty silly not to do
7190053 i am not about to get involved in how bad or how incidental it is we will judge it through the week
7190054 it is a very competitive market its a lot different to melbourne
7190055 those decisions will be made at the end of the year in terms of how many changes you can make to your list and where that takes you
7190056 brisbane and coach leigh matthews have done a similar job up there theyve remained competitive since their four grand finals 2001 04
7190057 were the two teams in those northern states where its very hard to bottom out but those decisions will be made at the end of the season
7190058 if you go back 12 months brand china was in tremendous difficulties with toxic toys and a number of other issues
7190059 chinas amazing haul of gold medals has mirrored its spectacular economic growth to signal to the world that china has truly arrived
7190060 from the grandeur of the opening ceremony to the self assured way chinese athletes expected to win in so many events china exceeded every expectation
7190061 companies like li ning that are looking to expand globally are going to use the olympics as a chance to do that
7190062 it wont do much to lift growth as the chinese economy is so huge
7190063 before the games people were anticipating a business boom in tourism benefiting hotels airlines and local restaurants
7190064 now its becoming clear that the impact wasnt all that big i dont think industries like that are likely to benefit greatly from one month of olympics and paralympics
7190065 analysing the one off macroeconomic impact or the economics of the games is not really an issue of such great importance
7190066 the beijing olympics are another milepost in chinas transformation into an efficient market oriented and financially sophisticated economy and a more open society

7190076 south africans are a proud nation they want to be winners they want to back a winning side
7190077 one big message that we want to get out there is that we will never go out and lose a game on purpose
7190078 rome wasnt built in one day so i think we should be patient as the players should be more patient on the team
7190079 i would ask that the public still give us some time
7190080 the laws have changed you look at how we were caught fast asleep in the first half of the super 14 by not changing quick enough to the laws
7190081 i believe that we are on the right track and the players do believe it
7190082 its just that they have to get used to it and we will get used to it
7190083 yes we believe in it and i think we worked hard this whole week on exactly what we want to do on the field
7190084 its just about execution the chances are there but were making too many mistakes for international players thats unacceptable
7190085 were the springboks were the world champs and we lost two games in a row
7190086 i think if you go to the change room and you look at the players theyd be feeling worse than the crowd out there
7190087 its our jobs its our work its our passion its our lives and its unacceptable for us to play like that

7190090 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7190091 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7190092 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7190093 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7190094 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7190095 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7190096 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7190097 he has to make people more comfortable with him as a person
7190098 im disappointed i didnt throw as well as i liked today and it didnt go as well as i would have liked
7190099 my role is to jump in and make it as if nothings changed thats something im going to have to do a better job of as this year goes along
7190100 what happened today is that i think you saw the classic nfl approach to a young quarterback
7190101 pressuring to see if he can handle it and if he cant handle it keep pressuring him at times he did the right thing and the people he was throwing to were not on the same page with him
7190102 thats something as a young quarterback that you can expect in this league we really didnt do anything to hurt them too bad with it so theyre going to keep putting pressure on me
7190103 hopefully we can get some of those guys back and this team has to understand that everybody has to be at their best and play their best game for us to have a chance
7190104 theyre detroit fans and if theyre not rooting for the home team what are they doing here
7190105 its expected but i dont play for the lions anymore i play for the browns maybe if i was a lion id be a little bit disappointed but im not

7190108 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7190109 it feels good to make history here it feels good to make history for kenya and win the gold
7190110 you can see from this tournament how we need to upgrade the level of the judges
7190111 that experience is going to make this experience that much better
7190112 you can say its a short week you can say whatever you want but im not that type of guy i completely take the burden for this loss i didnt execute as well as id like to and didnt really get into a rhythm and didnt allow our team to put some real positive drives together
7190113 id be lying if i said that wasnt a factor but my role is to jump in and make us go
7190114 thats something i have to do a better job of
7190115 throughout that second quarter we found a little rhythm started to get into somewhat of a flow and we made a few things happen
7190116 early in the third again we started to move the ball down the field but i think the third down was most disappointing for me because i should have stuck on donte stallworth
7190117 towards the end of the first half i think i got settled in a little bit i started to see some things out there that we were able to adjust to
7190118 when they see a young quarterback theyre going to pressure him and see if he can handle it
7190119 and if he cant handle it theyre going to keep bringing it
7190120 sometimes they got to him and sometimes he did the right thing but the people he was throwing to werent on the same page with him you have to be on the same page for it to work sometimes when youre pressured that happens you try to get the ball out faster than you need to
7190121 there were times when guys came and werent picked up and i have to try to go somewhere quick with the ball in that situation you try to do best you can to give them opportunity to make a play
7190122 i dont want to make excuses as the quarterback you always have the ball in your hand you have to adjust
7190123 people never see him they always see their own desires and hopes reflected back to them
7190124 im not going to marry an eighteen year old girl grandmother
7190125 robert be reasonable you need to marry sometime dont you want a wife one young enough to give you children any one of your sisters friends would be quite suitable
7190126 i do not think i have met her yet but i feel certain that i will know her when she does finally appear
7190127 the house is quiet we need children in it once again
7190128 perhaps my sister can do the honors in a few years grandmother all she lacks is a suitable husband
7190129 have you become a confirmed bachelor robert robert laughed and bent to kiss his grandmothers pale cheek i did not intend to remain a bachelor for the rest of my life
7190130 i can only assure you once again that i wait for the right woman i know it sounds foolish but it is the truth

7190136 ho esperienza tanti anni nel calcio e tante partite importanti alle spalle per esempio per quanto riguarda la supercoppa ne ho giocate vinte e perse sia in portogallo che in inghilterra quella di domani sar la quinta supercoppa della mia carriera quindi conosco le dimensioni dellimpegno vero al meazza di san siro sar la prima volta ci siamo allenati venerd ma quella di domani sar la prima partita nella mia casa perch ora lo stadio dellinter la mia casa una situazione nuova ma credo che mi adatter senza problemi inoltre sar veramente la prima volta con i nostri tifosi a brunico durante il ritiro stato bellissimo ma allo stadio sar diverso ma la cosa migliore nel calcio vincere quindi sar bello se alla fine della partita saremo noi i vincitori
7190137 ha sempre giocato molto bene ho avuto sempre limpressione di una bella squadra che giocava un buon calcio un calcio positivo ma adesso tutto diverso una cosa guardare una squadra per il piacere di guardare una cosa studiare una squadra perch la vai ad affrontare sono due prospettive completamente diverse penso che anche tutte le squadre che hanno grandi qualit hanno anche punti deboli linter una squadra di grandi qualit ma ha i suoi punti deboli e il lavoro dei giocatori quello di lavorare per nasconderli e lo stesso per la roma una squadra di qualit ma con punti deboli che noi cercheremo di individuare
7190138 questa sempre stata la mia vita calcistica sia in portogallo che in inghilterra in portogallo perch ho vinto troppo presto con un grande club in inghilterra invece con una squadra che non aveva mai vinto il campionato ma con un presidente roman che voleva vincere subito questa la mia storia ora lavoro allinter che negli ultimi anni ha vinto e che vuole continuare a vincere ma ripeto per me non una novit o una difficolt non mi dispiace penso che pi facile per un allenatore arrivare in una squadra che non ha vinto niente e fare qualcosa di straordinario come successo per esempio al chelsea che non vinceva il campionato da 50 anni qui diverso roberto ha vinto gli ultimi due tornei non sar nuovo per linter se vinceremo ancora il campionato
7190139 non posso dire che abbiamo solo segreti perch tutti con il passare delle partite possono capire il nostro modo di giocare e di pensare ma posso dire che linter vuole difendere bene ma con pochi giocatori senza costruire un blocco compatto difensivo senza utilizzare un marcatore centrale come terzino o due mediani davanti alla difesa abbiamo idea di difendere bene ma pensando gi ad attaccare anche perch non siamo una squadra che ha come principale caratteristica il contropiede per le nostre caratteristiche vogliamo avere il controllo della partita della palla vogliamo essere organizzati meccanicamente sfruttando il lavoro degli allenamenti e vogliamo avere la creativit dei nostri calciatori che hanno creativit penso per esempio a ibrahimovic muntari balotelli la squadra che noi vogliamo avere deve essere compatta e per me c una relazione stretta tra squadra compatta e lavoro tattico durante la settimana ma anche una squadra con il piacere di giocare e di portare piacere a chi la vedr giocare
7190140 stimo tutti non posso dire di essere amico di qualcuno perch per il mio concetto di amicizia non pu si pu costruire due minuti prima della partita due minuti dopo la partita o in panchina durante la gara a trenta metri di distanza luno dallaltro io pago sempre con lo stesso soldo rispetto con rispetto non rispetto non rispetto

7190218 so what does that make you special millions of other people have stuff on line everywhere too do you have a published book
7190219 no not yet but im working on it i mean just look at this one write a story in less than ten words what the fuck kind of writing is that no serious writer would ever do that
7190220 for sale baby shoes never worn i think hemingway wrote that one
7190221 oh you are so full of shit dont tell me you think thats clever or something
7190222 yes i do think its clever whats not clever is the size of your ego compared to the size of your mind little versus gigantic get what im saying
7190223 oh i get it you think im small minded because i think these challenge things are a cheap hack
7190224 you finally got the message now move your big ass out of the computer chair im going to re register so i can get in on these challenges

7190226 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7190227 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7190228 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7190229 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7190230 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7190231 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7190232 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7190233 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7190234 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7190235 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7190236 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7190237 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7190238 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7190239 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7190240 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7190241 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7190242 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7190243 allensworth cemetery committee j a heckett j w singleton and laura smith
7190244 draft wise for pittsburgh uniquely i think limas sweed and rashard mendenhall are going to affect their teams more so than you might think of by terms of draft choices just because of the positions theyre at
7190245 so i really think along with ben roethlisberger that balance that they have that pittsburgh still is the team to beat
7190246 make plays outside of the structure of the offense that you cant account for
7190247 big ben is really good when hes running out of the pocket
7190248 it is our opinion the current method of administering these funds is not in compliance with new hampshire law and must therefore be brought into compliance
7190249 it is difficult to ascertain where the office of police chief begins and the officer of director of elderly affairs ends and vice versa
7190250 as long as there are separate budgets she seems perfectly happy with that
7190251 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7190252 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7190253 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood

7190266 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7190267 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7190268 the intent is that it will be used as an institutional development tool
7190269 theres a lot of politics and a lot of business conducted in the suites
7190270 the governor is always welcome at an lsu football game with whomever he wants to bring
7190271 but the work of civil rights broadly the whole fight for the rights of the individual will continue
7190272 the largest challenge facing jesse is in a day when you have a barack in government and there are players like sharpton in civil rights are you still relevant
7190273 part of his relevance is that some of the new players out there people like me he helped mentor
7190274 the question now is does he play the elder statesman in terms of living through them
7190275 i wanted to see if there was a gap between my heart and my lip
7190276 it was not meant to publicly embarrass him because i had shared the message with him before
7190277 the unsaid prayer was the prayer for peace between me and jesse
7190278 i have lived long enough to see the fruits of my labors ive been blessed ever since the 1960s ive seen 40 years of struggle from the front lines
7190279 its the opportunity for michelle to tell the story of her life
7190280 it will be a very personal story that she tells we want to give them voters a sense of the obama family and how they would be in the white house
7190281 i thought ok hes probably not all that terrific and hes probably kind of a clown and then i found out that his name was barack obama
7190282 and like everybody else i thought well what kind of name is that
7190283 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7190284 she has been absolutely savaged by the talk shows rush limbaugh and sean hannity pull her apart almost every day
7190285 she knows who she is and where she comes from
7190286 it first lady is one of the ultimate symbols of grace femininity and american womanhood it will take some americans a moment to have that symbolized by a black woman
7190287 on top of that with michelle obama theres the stereotype about the angry black woman some of her mannerisms will be looked at through a different magnifying glass because she is black
7190288 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
7190289 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
7190290 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
7190291 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to ensure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
7190292 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
7190293 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
7190294 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
7190295 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
7190296 i emphasize that davis personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
7190297 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
7190298 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
7190299 georgia is a very modern normal country with very interesting people like americans that are being battered and butchered
7190300 this is a cold blooded murder of a small free independent country by a ruthless big neighbor
7190301 at least in the american media georgia has won the message war and hes influenced that for sure
7190302 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction
7190303 it was very important for saakashvili and for georgia that those pictures went around the world
7190304 the russian authorities are significantly more interested in getting internal support for their actions
7190305 we are seeing the return of vintage soviet propaganda television expresses only the official point of view of the kremlin
7190306 why did no one run over to help him in an emergency maybe his life could have been saved
7190307 peoples lives are being lost but sometimes i wonder if anyone cares if another mexican immigrant dies
7190308 you see people crouching underneath tractors when you go out in the fields we think workers should be able to rest with dignity
7190309 if somebody doesnt have shade up and available for workers this summer theyre going to get a whuppin
7190310 collections has been a problem historically and we need to fix it i cant sugarcoat it
7190311 people have been dying all along every year for decades and now that were finally focusing on it were finding all these heat fatalities were doing all we can with the very limited resources we have
7190312 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7190313 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe

7190328 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7190329 what happens when you get what you want the growing blogosphere angst
7190330 i just look at each one as an individual case
7190331 people have blogs that become very popular maybe blogging is just the activity of posting content to the web some blogs are journalism and some arent
7190332 gnomedex founder chris pirillo is good at keeping an audience why because he writes good stuff either you write good stuff or you write crap bottom line
7190333 i consider my blog a loss leader for my other businesses
7190334 i do all of those things but ultimately my blog is the heart of it
7190335 from the beginning of my blog in 2004 i decided its not about driving traffic its about driving influence
7190336 from the beginning i said i wasnt going to overblog i was only going to blog when i had something to say
7190337 is that the audience is starting to follow me its really about people wanting to hear what i have to say
7190338 voices who share barack obamas vision of making america stronger and safer
7190339 a new tough foreign policy approach that is neither republican nor democratic
7190340 the 2008 convention will highlight americans coming together to change the course of this nation
7190341 the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need
7190342 the story of people from across the country who believe it is time for change
7190343 these towns have traditionally used a whole series of legal yet subtle tactics to keep their beaches unfriendly and inaccessible
7190344 if youre a mother of three youre not going to go to a part of the shore that doesnt have bathrooms and nearby parking its de facto privatization of the shore
7190345 not only just get to the shore but park there and enjoy the experience
7190346 the one gentleman denihan was very very upset hed love to take it all back if he could
7190347 you shouldnt have to worry about being hauled away in handcuffs for sitting down on a beach
7190348 you have the right to swim in the ocean to get out of it and sit or lie down on the sand
7190349 the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7190350 the dream will endure as a legacy to the kennedys
7190351 but it is just that today a dream its not the reality of american politics
7190352 the only moment of conciliation at that convention was the tribute to bob
7190353 i dont think many republicans would want their kids to get in the car with sen kennedy
7190354 the happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts therefore guard accordingly and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature
7190355 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7190356 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7190357 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7190358 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7190359 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7190360 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7190361 but depending on their condition and how much time theyre spending in the water this could be problematic its going to cost them more energy to swim through water than travel on land
7190362 there were some years when some bears may have had to swim as far as 100 miles
7190363 now the ice is much farther offshore more consistently and for longer so the possibility of long distances between land and sea ice is much greater
7190364 arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple of days after hitting shore
7190365 that means we are still getting fish reproducing in the summertime
7190366 thats true but we may have bottomed out and stopped the decline and in my book thats a winner
7190367 is now the seat of individuals who were appointed illegally and that means that in the minds of many people the court symbolizes illegality
7190368 the fact that the process was flawed does not mean that the immigration judges selected through that process are unfit to serve
7190369 change we need after eight years of failed policies that favored special interests at the expense of our families under george bush and john mccain
7190370 joe biden is the genuine article who has brought change to washington without being changed by washington
7190371 when it first started i thought it was a 1 in 1 000 chance
7190372 but the process kept moving along and we were still in it
7190373 then she did it two or three times the next day
7190374 they go through every aspect of your family and financial life
7190375 its a very intensive and intrusive process i never dreamed that somebody would have to read one of my speeches from 25 years ago
7190376 too much confusion discussing a relatively unknown congressman at the same time that another edwards was drawing the ire of the public
7190377 he said that he was going to make another choice he was very gracious
7190378 maybe theyll offer the director of the cia position to me
7190379 in a town of leaks i could keep a secret for 2 1 2 months
7190380 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7190381 thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows every conductor on that amtrak train to wilmington
7190382 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7190383 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7190384 over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgment intelligence and steel in his spine
7190385 ive watched as hes inspired millions of americans to this new cause and during those 18 months i must tell you frankly i have been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and gave in to the swift boat politics he once so deplored
7190386 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the united states of america joe biden
7190387 right now the polygraph is the best tool they have at their hands but its not a tool thats without problems
7190388 if you were to say who is the unluckiest person i know in the world
7190389 said ted kaufman bidens chief of staff for much of his first 22 years in the senate
7190390 if you were to say who is the luckiest person i know in the world
7190391 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7190392 were not naive enough to think this equals victory in november but its a great opportunity that can be leveraged
7190393 you turn a 35 percent democratic turnout area into a 42 percent area and you have a real impact on countywide races
7190394 im not saying these are easy wins but we certainly are in the game
7190395 can he attract a boost in democratic turnout and once theyre there will they vote straight d
7190396 the northern part of the district is the type of suburban middle class area where obama has been popular
7190397 and then the southern part of the district has a concentration of minority voters so thats a perfect district where the assets of the obama campaign converge to assist
7190398 the other night i was with a group of people and the fastest thing to do was to get on the bus some of these people had never been on a bus as if this was some awful low class way
7190399 people who wouldnt normally take the bus they can see this beautiful piece of art here and want to take public transportation
7190400 we as an industry need to repaint the picture and make it attractive
7190401 lets just say that my previous employment didnt require it o
7190402 i dont necessarily feel like i need assistance but its nice to know theyre reaching out
7190403 were humans there have been mistakes made and we can do better
7190404 were looking for feedback from the survivor families to do things better in the future this letter is helping us to reconnect with them and in case there are certain services theyre missing out on were there for them
7190405 we understand the sacrifices you and your family have made in service to this nation and we want to assure you the army is here to provide you the support you need for as long as you desire
7190406 i am still very very deeply sorrowed by this especially this month
7190407 i do know there are families that definitely need that
7190408 when it gets a little boring i might pull it out
7190409 we think this is the way the future is going to work
7190410 in every condition of decrepitude some with two crutches some with one some with but one arm some partially blind and some totally blind
7190411 manhood enough to stand on street corners day and night freezing cold and storm to sell newspapers for pennies rather than beg which from the evidence would in some instances be equally or more remunerative
7190412 this guy was an american hero in 1961 he was bringing up deforestation being a major issue he was talking about government not representing peoples interests he was talking about jobs being lost to outsourcing about juvenile delinquency happening because both parents have to work well these are all things that have come to pass
7190413 it seems like bringing issues to the table will be my contribution to mankind
7190414 im selling the constitution but i dont consider myself to be really patriotic nationalism to me is as bad as racism or sexism i just find it our last defense the last eight years have been crazy youve got kids in iraq who were 12 when bush took office they dont know things arent supposed to be like this
7190415 at this juncture mr gants newsstand is currently in violation of three elements of the municipal code
7190416 obviously it is frustrating when guns injure or kill people but when a young person is hurt it is a deeper blow
7190417 we are making strides but at times your success is punctuated by incidents like this that show how much more work there is to be done
7190418 its obviously senseless but the fact of the matter is that virtually all these cases are senseless
7190419 it used to be youd arrive at a crime scene and youd find five or six shell casings
7190420 if it takes flair to do it ill do it
7190421 this city has all the potential in the world its time to do something in this town
7190422 hes a good promoter but you have to act on facts
7190423 hes doing a great job hes willing to do the things to put together a plan to move this city forward
7190424 it has been a great learning experience to work with the little girl as i have never acted with a child before unlike adults children are natural actors and they dont care about practicalities of life
7190425 she is a perfect actor and i even learnt from her how to give a shot watching her act was really a treat
7190426 i play aarti who is superstitious and also believes in god my role in the film is close to what i am in real life because i believe in good and evil spirits
7190427 whatever plans ramuji has for me i accept it as of now he has not approached me for any other film but if he offers anything i will be glad to accept it
7190428 aan en verdomd nog aan toe ik doe net of ze heerlijk zitten zal wel eens even
7190429 what if the bridge leading into town was out wouldnt that be creepy and neat
7190430 lopunnys the leader of a famous team team charm im sure chatot or one of the others can explain more ive heard little when it comes to team charm

7190451 oh im thinking out of the box i travel the path less traveled im not like everyone else im different
7190452 had wat mij betreft ook een passende naam geweest maar dat ligt niet zo lekker in het gehoor en je kunt je dan ook afvragen of het de verkoopcijfers ten voordele zou be nvloeden o ja ik zou wat uitleg geven naar aanleiding van deze wat uitgebreide intro
7190453 kreeg hem door uiterst behoedzaam de wijk in te sturen heelhuids voor de deur en met hulp van fleur de buurvrouw en tebbo hebben we hem ook nog weten te keren zodat hij
7190454 en zien dat ik het stuk dat ik mij voorgehouden had af te ronden
7190455 op zon moment weet ik dat ik spelbreker ben ontkrachter van de diepere innerlijke wensen van mijn lief de bruut het baasje

7190458 sprak ze aan het eind van de avond hetgeen wel iets zegt over haar energie
7190459 joens was er helemaal verguld mee klein traantje van ontroering
7190460 so go ahead and lie to me you can say anything small talk will be just fine your voice is everything we are two lives and it all depends on you so listen up this sun hasnt set i refuse to believe that its only me feelin it just hear me out

7190462 mais pourquoi il fait tout pour moi pour nous yann
7190463 mais je navais jamais vu sandy aussi panouie aussi joueuse
7190464 the good thing about tennis this year is that you have many players who are winning some major events
7190465 its a bigger competition its more attractive for the fans
7190466 i know there are some hungry guys desperate to make some type of mark
7190467 you dont ever know when youre going to see the beginning of the end
7190468 when you lose a little bit of that swagger guys in any sport pick up on that
7190469 ive enjoyed it talking about it being compared to the greatest
7190470 its a nice challenge beating the next generation trying to play for a long time trying to stay healthy trying to beat records
7190471 after this story i just dont have the heart for it
7190472 in purely statistical terms do articles in the montgomery county bulletin amount to the greatest plagiarism scandal in the annals of american journalism
7190473 if im going to decide to fight that fight and youre writing for me its not your responsibility to fight it
7190474 when the washington post slates parent company puts a blog up and calls it an investigative news piece theres a definite problem
7190475 hes denigrating me ridiculing me denigrating the paper maybe he feels i deserve that maybe he feels he should be the judge jury and executioner
7190476 all hes done is put a couple of rednecks out of a job
7190477 i could care less if a million people stole my work as long as i have my job theres people getting free rides everywhere
7190478 rosen should cut them some slack because they are a handful of nobodies running a shoestring budget labor of love in the godforsaken backwoods of montgomery county let the poor little scroungers get by its like goliath squashing a bug and laughing about it
7190479 i dont know how many people paid attention to it other than the ones that seemed to have some point of view they wanted to express
7190480 i live in walden on lake conroe which is three miles out of montgomery and its never been thrown at my house
7190481 i felt the paper at one time really shined and could really do something
7190482 he ladyman gave it two minutes and it went to sludge he had no leadership or drive im not surprised this has happened
7190483 i feel like im in the middle of two 3 year old kids in a sandbox
7190484 thats his choice but he runs the risk of something bad happening to his paper and thats not my fault
7190485 they are closing down and ill be able to move on before they close
7190486 it is a loss from the sense of having those affordable units available in the downtown area
7190487 but it is a short term loss because ymca officials have committed to providing funds to build some affordable units to take their place
7190488 there are people whose mission it is to do low income housing and fight homelessness
7190489 there are people who do it a lot better than we can
7190490 as low as you could get on the totem pole in the investment business
7190491 it was clean it was secure and certainly most parents much preferred their sons to live at the ymca than some other slot they might find
7190492 it was certainly not church but you were going to be respectful of the organization and the opportunity they were giving
7190493 i dont think there is enough affordable housing for low income people
7190494 weve had people go off their meds and go left on us
7190495 im just trying to break even until this time next year

7190497 a disk burned with the liteon units can be placed in a cyberhome 600 or 1200 and brings up a message that the disk was not made in a cyberhome and asks if i want to make it compatible a yes answer will do that and change the thumb nails and format and finalize them they can be played in any unit including the liteon inits
7190498 i was under the impression from other members posts that some recorder brands rca polaroid use the expression
7190499 a disk burned with the liteon units can be placed in a cyberhome 600 or 1200 and brings up a message that the disk was not made in a cyberhome and asks if i want to make it compatible a yes answer will do that and change the thumb nails and format and finalize them

7190501 weve entered gazan waters were flying the palestinian flag and we now believe that were going to reach the shores of gaza very soon i missed the start of the berlin wall coming down by just a few days but now i know how people felt when
7190502 we call for more activities to break the unfair siege imposed on our people

7190512 the communist party of the united states though purportedly a political party is in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the government of the united states
7190513 role as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence a clear and continuing danger to the security of the united states
7190514 rights privileges and immunities attendant upon legal bodies created under the jurisdiction of the laws of the united states

7190516 tipping point is that point at which the lake goes from a fine water resource to one that is full of algae and weeds
7190517 i think we can avoid going too far as long as we are vigilant
7190518 avoiding the tipping point how to balance development and preservation on canandaigua lake
7190519 how much will this lake sustain when it comes to development
7190520 our goal should not be to prevent others from enjoying it but to protect what we have
7190521 why not put more pressure for a sewer system around the lake
7190522 lookin for some lovin and a sip of something strong
7190523 and then what began as a literal thought first took shape into metallic rivers and then skies
7190524 with research about the specific histories of these sites i also became more aware of the conflicting political and social interests in the debates over development and preservation
7190525 combining the tradition of the industrial landscape with the romanticist veneration of the ruin lindquist has transformed the decrepit old factory into an elegy
7190526 i wouldnt let us sell the rights to our old shows that is why we are where we are today
7190527 to hear marty talk ive never worked a single day
7190528 he told me the one thing to remember is dont ever sell anything you create and always put your name above the title whatever you do
7190529 plenty of people approached the kroffts about buying their library usually at fire sale prices they said no to every offer even one from michael jackson
7190530 for that fashion forward girl that loves a more retro look
7190531 for years i yo yoed between skinny and fat as the hollywood game tried to play me
7190532 every dog has his day and every diva needs her gay
7190533 in 1985 when i became one of the artists in residence at the national museum of science and technology in ottawa i dreamt up this project about a chair that would fall apart and put itself back together again
7190534 a chair just seemed to be the natural thing to work with theyre everywhere and we take them almost for granted and we invest an enormous amount of trust in them theyre extensions of our body almost
7190535 i wanted my chair to be very generic and yet i wanted it to have this capacity to fall apart and put itself back together at that time i dont think it was conceivable to do it
7190536 the computing power wasnt even there it was only in 2004 that i got together with raff dandrea and he came up with the idea of the chair seat being the robot itself and it was only when we started building it that the whole metaphoric aspect of it the idea of falling became paramount in my mind falling seems to be everywhere in our western culture we fall in love we fall into depression we fall asleep
7190537 i think everyone has come at the chair with a particularly interesting take kids cry in front of it people applaud it people laugh at it people are cynical about it theres such a range of emotions that go on in front of this thing that its been overwhelming
7190538 i wont be missed at all theyre never missed they just disappear over the horizon some with lights blinking others not and are heard of no more
7190539 generally we have over the course of a year maybe two or three tent pole movies at least one of which wouldve manifested itself by now
7190540 where the studios got involved and they applied studio economics to independent film distribution so you know production budgets grew dramatically marketing budgets grew dramatically i think they all found out the audiences didnt grow at the same pace
7190541 when you get something that comes along that looks like it might do a little business they give it to the mainstream theaters now
7190542 i want to see if the person i used to be still exists to see that i am still human that i can still enjoy life
7190543 i lost my hope and became part of the sadness and ugliness
7190544 i saw so much killing and suffering that i couldnt find the beauty inside myself anymore
7190545 i wore out three agents who tried unsuccessfully to sell the book
7190546 i was blown away i liked angelas other two books but this one was so far beyond them in terms of depth complexity and literary quality it was one of the most beautifully written books id ever read
7190547 there wasnt a word that needed to be changed it wasnt bloated
7190548 we can handsell the publishing world is so mundane full of thrillers erotic vampire novels genre books it was great to have a high quality literary book to push
7190549 these days you need to know someone to get a book published
7190550 a man must liberate his soul otherwise hes in for trouble
7190551 ladies and gentlemen while destitute citizens rummage through garbage cans and prowl the streets what does our government do it sheathes the pentagon in gold i submit to you that we could at this moment vaporize whatever creeps crawls flies walks hops slithers or jumps meanwhile republicans wring their hands claiming we are defenseless ill prepared at the mercy of two bit tyrants
7190552 montesquieu said one must be truthful in all things even when they concern ones own country i do believe that
7190553 people have continued to fish there and its not enforced
7190554 im excited for the first time in my life i feel like i have a candidate i can believe in
7190555 i really feel like this is a moment in history a moment when we can really change things
7190556 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7190557 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7190558 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7190559 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7190560 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7190561 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7190562 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7190563 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7190564 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
7190565 is that i wish a woman would have been on the ticket but alas america is not ready to embrace and support having a woman on the ticket top or otherwise
7190566 this is a guy who can out straight talk the straight talk express
7190567 you might not always like what joe says but hes going to give it to you straight
7190568 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7190569 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7190570 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7190571 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7190572 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7190573 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7190574 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7190575 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all
7190576 i was just that program was made for texas a amp m we have an extremely strong military tradition here with the corps of cadets it is in our fabric
7190577 to get my gear i wound up going to about 30 different companies
7190578 but i want to see how else i can help out
7190579 theres more to supporting your troops than putting up a little decal
7190580 i believe its my responsibility to make sure other soldiers are ok
7190581 had to use physical force to transfer mathes to the less harsh cell environment
7190582 the space program is the thing that gets overlooked the most
7190583 he got very animated and defensive about his vietnam policies
7190584 he stood up and waved his arms in front of me at one point
7190585 he believed in what he did in vietnam he very very much defended his position
7190586 great president he has a terrific legacy except for the stain of the war
7190587 she told me for black people johnson will be the greatest president there ever was
7190588 johnson was the last president to be successful with a major domestic agenda
7190589 you cant talk about 20th century politics or texas history for that matter without mentioning lbj
7190590 he teetered on the line between strong leader and veritable force of nature
7190591 this is a decision about parenting vulnerability and vaccine attitudes not sexuality
7190592 mothers who havent had their daughter vaccinated yet most often said they want more time to learn about the vaccine
7190593 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and olympic games and beyond
7190594 we are continuing to raise our concerns at senior levels of the and to follow their cases closely
7190595 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7190596 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7190597 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency
7190598 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7190599 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7190600 he has to make people more comfortable with him as a person
7190601 its generally a problem thats anxiety based where a child gets anxious at the idea of going to school it may manifest itself in a physical way stomach pains leg pains
7190602 generally the childs fear is real and the symptoms are real
7190603 many people use the term without the clarity and correctness of what it really is
7190604 he was rolling around on the floor in pain he was losing weight rapidly
7190605 when i saw him i said oh no this isnt a school phobia
7190606 floyd is glad she went with her gut emergency room workers found polyps on her sons colon
7190607 they get fed up they get frustrated and they dont want to go to school theyre tired of being last in the class of being ridiculed
7190608 he was so fearful and would shake so badly that the assistant principal would have to physically remove him from my car and take him to class or to his office
7190609 his first grade teacher would notice his whole body tremble as she asked for his homework
7190610 id probably broken too many pieces of furniture in my house so my parents put me into a gym
7190611 i was a wild child who had way too much energy
7190612 so my parents threw me in a gymnastics facility to just bounce in the foam and try things
7190613 we know were about to get a medal we told the guys trust your training do what you have to do raj came through with a huge routine there youre trying to win on the horse and your arms are shaking but he came through
7190614 a lot of parents want their son to be a doctor studious
7190615 womens gymnastics has more of a dance background and thats why boys get teased about it because womens gymnastics gets put on television more
7190616 when you explain that boys gymnastics is more about strength and skill it doesnt have dance in it they see it as more of a mans sport
7190617 angel was walking a fine line and that tightrope just finally broke
7190618 i cant let him talk to anyone right now there is a federal investigation going on
7190619 i dont think theyd ever had another wreck ever and they were in business for more than a decade
7190620 they had only taken possession of it in july it had only been driven two or three times and thats the tire it came with
7190621 when i was with him when a new driver came we asked for a license asked for his full name and id ask for a background check
7190622 i kept it all in a file cabinet back then all the drivers we hired had clean records and we had drug tests
7190623 he was cutting back real far back thats why he couldnt get a real good quality of driver he wasnt paying
7190624 i went though angels files with a fine toothed comb
7190625 there were drivers that had never been drug tested for their pre employee screening and from the files i looked at i did not see one driver that had been pulled for a random drug test
7190626 i cant think why this happened he was an honest man
7190627 weve used him in the past on a couple of occasions as far as i know hes never had an accident
7190628 i thought he was a good person ive never heard anyone have anything bad to say about him in terms of his business
7190629 but people put buses out on the road all the time that are unsafe held together by baling wire and hope for the best
7190630 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7190631 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7190632 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7190633 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7190634 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7190635 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7190636 linea leen ee ah terminal tehr mihn ahl donde esta dohn deh ess tah
7190637 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7190638 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7190639 we are continuing to raise our concerns at senior levels of the chinese government and to follow their cases closely
7190640 were back on top of the west and as we know its so important to have that home field advantage for the second round of the playoffs and thats even looking ahead a little bit were taking it game by game and it was my first game back
7190641 if we dont get a result in new york then its back to a three or four point lead in the west
7190642 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7190643 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7190644 what happens when you get what you want the growing blogosphere angst
7190645 i just look at each one as an individual case
7190646 people have blogs that become very popular maybe blogging is just the activity of posting content to the web some blogs are journalism and some arent
7190647 gnomedex founder chris pirillo is good at keeping an audience why because he writes good stuff either you write good stuff or you write crap bottom line
7190648 i consider my blog a loss leader for my other businesses
7190649 i do all of those things but ultimately my blog is the heart of it
7190650 from the beginning of my blog in 2004 i decided its not about driving traffic its about driving influence
7190651 from the beginning i said i wasnt going to overblog i was only going to blog when i had something to say
7190652 is that the audience is starting to follow me its really about people wanting to hear what i have to say
7190653 every time the government has lost data ministers have promised a crackdown but nothing has happened and a culture of complacency remains said shadow justice secretary nick herbert
7190654 while an overworked johnson did not initially notice the empire parker was building the rival deputies particularly the experienced tory councillor sir simon milton did
7190655 michael has an incredibly clever mind but sometimes its too sharp
7190656 lavish holiday exposes the lie of ordinary guy david cameron
7190657 bucket and spade dave has shown his true blue colours by holidaying on a 21 000 a week yacht surrounded by an armada of seven boats of 74 mates and family and banqueting in the finest restaurants sunbathing on a s21 000 a week yacht waited on by an army of staff this is the holiday tory leader david cameron would prefer that you didnt see it was mr camerons second holiday within a month but unlike the first he didnt invite the press along three weeks ago the tory leader and wife samantha posed for official pictures as he holidayed with his family on a humble bucket and spade beach in cornwall
7190658 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so it might be something innocuous such as what time is my car coming or when am i going to the hairdresser but the fact she needed to repeat them opened a new and frightening chapter in our lives
7190659 quick hm thatd be ironic for a trial lawyer buffett yeah
7190660 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7190661 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7190662 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7190663 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7190664 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7190665 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7190666 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7190667 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7190668 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7190669 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7190670 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7190671 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7190672 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7190673 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7190674 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7190675 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7190676 me first in every case though this message is not conveyed directly to others
7190677 collaboration operates through a process in which the successful intellectual achievements of one person arouse the intellectual passions and enthusiasms of others
7190678 collaboration operates through a process in which the successful intellectual achievements of one person arouse the intellectual passions and enthusiasms of others
7190679 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7190680 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7190681 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7190682 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7190683 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7190684 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7190685 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7190686 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7190687 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7190688 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7190689 declaramos alerta roja a los hospitales fern ndez rivadavia y argerich y enviamos doce ambulancias del sistema al lugar evacuamos un total de 15 pacientes con politraumatismos diversos leves y todos fuera de peligro
7190690 los heridos son por golpes con los asientos ca das y esguinces de tobillo
7190691 despu s que importa del despu s toda mi vida es el ayer que me detiene en el pasado
7190692 its amazing this is what i get paid to do this is what i live for
7190693 this is all i really want to go out there every fifth day and do my job
7190694 research has shown sixth graders are more like seventh graders than they are like fourth and fifth graders
7190695 theyre at a stage where theyre ready to grow academically and socially
7190696 theres so many switches and stuff with lockers and ive never done any of that
7190697 a bird may love a fish signore but where will they live
7190698 oh well we just dont know why little johnny shot little tommy in the face well never know
7190699 many consumers are growing in their watchfulness as to what goes

7190706 ya begitulah le nak gaya orang makan sekarang ini tentunya bagi mereka yang gak ngerti adab etika makan cara islam belum lagi kalau ngikuti aturan makan gaya barat yang memang menjadikan tangan kiri sebagai rekan tangan kanan dalam soal carnivoraisme begitu
7190707 kalau kita orang beriman ya mesti ngikuti aturan allah yang dicontohkan oleh nabi kita muhammad
7190708 nah tangan kanan punya bagian sendiri tangin kiri pun punya bagian sendiri masing masing punya pekerjaan yang berbeda beda ovan kalau cebok pake tangan yang mana
7190709 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7190710 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7190711 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7190712 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7190713 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7190714 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7190715 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7190716 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

7190718 ik had mijzelf als doel gesteld om nadat ik vorig jaar met prins willem alexander gekiekt was nu met prinses m xima op de foto te gaan ik had een poster laten afdrukken met eigen fotos en die aan prinses m xima aangeboden ze is daarna met mij op de foto gegaan ze was echt z leuk prins willem alexander maakte de foto en hield de camera eerst voor de grap achterstevoren iedereen lachen natuurlijk het was echt super
7190719 im really proud of all the girls not just carli
7190720 carli had a big part in it she scored the decisive goal
7190721 when she scored the goal we went sprinting around the restaurant screaming
7190722 the first thing she said was thank you for everything
7190723 brazil has better soccer players but the u s has better athletes
7190724 i wanted as much as you did to cross the finish a scene you have already got used to please believe me the sadness and pain i have been through are not less than yours
7190725 my heart hurt when i saw the news it was a great regret him not to break the world record give his best performance and for our spectators not to celebrate with him he is our dear family member we will be together forever
7190726 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7190727 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7190728 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7190729 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7190730 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7190731 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7190732 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7190733 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7190734 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7190735 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7190736 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7190737 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7190738 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7190739 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7190740 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7190741 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7190742 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7190743 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7190744 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7190745 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7190746 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7190747 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7190748 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7190749 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7190750 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7190751 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7190752 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7190753 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7190754 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

7190791 het is jouw afwas ik heb de mijne vanochtend gedaan
7190792 zullen we gaan dansen er zijn altijd wel gratis proeflessen
7190793 laten we het eens van de vraagkant bekijken in plaats van de aanbodkant
7190794 we zouden een psychologische test moeten doen om daar achter te komen
7190795 toegesneden op onze specifieke situatie eens kijken wat voor vragen kunnen we stellen om er achter te komen wat we willen
7190796 grote letters helder taalgebruik zodat we niet moeten nadenken wat er bedoeld wordt als we onszelf straks de test afnemen
7190797 dat was godverdomme rood geef die lul rood wat nou niks gezien wir haben es zeker weer nicht gewusst
7190798 ik wil roekje verrassen met mijn kennis van het onderbewustzijn en de invloed die het heeft op de partnerrelatie
7190799 we gaan gezellig in een kring zitten dat praat makkelijk sommigen ken ik al zie ik ik heet iedereen welkom als het gaat over partnerrelaties denken we meteen aan de relatie tussen man en vrouw of
7190800 we denken dat een partnerrelatie vooral met die ander te maken heeft maar heel veel kun je vinden in je eigen ikje dat onbekende ikje vinden daarom gaat het dit is een eerste ori nterende sessie waarin we globaal alvast wat technieken zullen bekijken
7190801 sluit je ogen en stel je voor dat je in de dierentuin loopt je hebt een kind aan de hand probeer je dat kind zo levendig mogelijk voor te stellen
7190802 nu moet je je even voorstellen dat het kind lastig wordt het gaat zeuren wil steeds ergens anders heen wat doe je
7190803 nu mogen jullie je ogen weer openen schrijf op wat je doet met dat lastige kind in de dierentuin
7190804 het kind dat staat natuurlijk voor je eigen onderbewuste ikje het geheim van het leven is eigenlijk het kind goed opvoeden
7190805 hoe kan ik mijn ikje kennen na n zon test
7190806 jongens vergeet het niet h het gaat hier om de eerste techniek op weg naar ontdekking en verbetering van je eigen ik wat zijn je eigen barri res voor geluk in de relatie als we dat bij onszelf ontdekt hebben komen we bij de laatste techniek de techniek van de roze ballon waarbij je al je blokkades al je remmingen al je alles in een roze ballon projecteert en die op laat stijgen pff weg voor we pauzeren wil ik dat jullie een emotie bedenken die het best past bij het lastige kind schrijf dat op
7190807 we havent given him the best run support but every game we feel like we have a great chance to win when he pitches and again he pitched great today
7190808 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7190809 and obviously i knew you got to go on that ball the whole situation was the corners were in and you got to see the ball past the pitcher and not at the corners
7190810 i understand i made a mistake but i flinched for a second making sure it got past the pitcher and it wasnt at the corners and it wasnt a line drive getting caught i should have instead of flinching i should have been taking a step forward so i had momentum in the right direction i just made a mistake and i just have to learn from it i realize that
7190811 it will help me see more pitching more good pitching
7190812 hes been out a lot this year already with the injured right ankle he needs a few more at bats i think i would highly recommend it yes he can go down and work on his swing a little bit and work on the base stealing part of it again and make some improvements in that area i would think thats what he needs to do
7190813 i was pretty much working on driving the ball to right field it was something i was good at last year but not this year
7190814 takes a lot of pressure off everybody in the lineup
7190815 were deeper and its made our lineup tougher to navigate
7190816 at some point in time just got to figure out what the heck it is obviously its not what i want but at this juncture something needs to happen obviously theres something going on
7190817 we had the one day friday where it kind of came back thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better the treatment and stuff is definitely working
7190818 i dont know where to go from here but i know i had to shut it down
7190819 im very disappointed because i was ahead of schedule i was a week or two ahead and i was going to go on a rehab assignment monday at triple a and now this i was sprinting and i felt something and i had to stop i had to push it and it didnt react too well
7190820 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7190821 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7190822 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7190823 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7190824 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7190825 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7190826 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7190827 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7190828 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7190829 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7190830 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7190831 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7190832 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7190833 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7190834 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7190835 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7190836 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7190837 who are open to doing something on the production side
7190838 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7190839 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7190840 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7190841 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7190842 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7190843 the children realised that when i explained it to them
7190844 as a little child i stood with flowers at his grave and did not know why people were crying
7190845 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7190846 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7190847 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7190848 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7190849 ay date a ti mismo y los dem s te ayudar n
7190850 no hagas por los dem s aquello que ellos pueden hacer por s mismos
7190851 todo lo que haces a los dem s tambi n te lo haces a ti
7190852 no hagas a los dem s aquello que quieres para ti pueden tener gustos diferentes
7190853 no hagas a los dem s aquello que no quieres que te hagan a ti
7190854 no podr s hacer y dar a los dem s aquello que no eres capaz de hacer ni darte a ti mismo
7190855 tener el deber de hacer limpieza de las relaciones que son ficticias insanas y no nos dejan crecer como personas
7190856 pensar que algo nos ser dado sin que hagamos algo por ello y quejarnos por no recibirlo contribuye a la contaminaci n emocional
7190857 me gustar a que todo el mundo viviera con tanto lujo que la gente comenzara a aburrirse del lujo que la tierra entera fuera capaz por primera vez de ser tan lujosa que no sientas ninguna necesidad material qu vas a hacer entonces cuando todas las necesidades materiales est n cubiertas no queda nada m s que la meditaci n esa es la nica puerta que sigue abierta todav a has llamado a todas las dem s puertas y has visto que no hay nada s lo queda una nica puerta abierta todav a invit ndote y todo el que ha entrado por esa puerta jam s ha regresado frustrado decepcionado no ha habido ni un solo caso en toda la historia de la humanidad en que alguien que haya alcanzado el centro de su ser haya quedado defraudado se haya sentido vac o se haya sentido desgraciado se haya suicidado ni una sola excepci n por eso digo que la meditaci n es algo cient fico as es como funciona la ciencia si puedes encontrar algo sin ninguna excepci n se convierte en una regla la meditaci n es un m todo cient fico porque en toda la historia de la humanidad nadie ha dicho que no te conduce a la dicha suprema
7190858 t no puedes hacer meditaci n s lo puedes estar en meditaci n
7190859 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7190860 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7190861 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7190862 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7190863 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7190864 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7190865 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7190866 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7190867 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7190868 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7190869 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7190870 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7190871 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7190872 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7190873 imagine a world in which generations of human beings come to believe that certain films were made by god or that specific software was coded by him imagine a future in which millions of our descendants murder each other over rival interpretations of star wars or windows 98 could anything anything be more ridiculous and yet this would be no more ridiculous than the world we are living in
7190874 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7190875 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7190876 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7190877 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7190878 this time around im the new kid on the block and school isnt just about learning
7190879 parents are putting their childs education and future in my hands and theyre trusting me to take their child to the next level
7190880 i feel that responsibility greater now than when i was substituting and student teaching
7190881 the good news is were filling all our allocations with qualified teachers
7190882 it just happened that i graduated at the right time and i finished my student teaching at a right time
7190883 i always knew in the back of my mind that i wanted to be a teacher
7190884 id rather be in a class full of kids the energy they bring the questions they ask by the end of the school year you just care so much about them
7190885 ive always been very lucky in my life and i wanted to give back
7190886 hug was the first place that i thought of because it gave so much to me
7190887 seeing that there are so few delegates to a national convention it is wonderful that ridgefield is so well represented
7190888 and to have susan representing ridgefield democrats at their convention is terrific
7190889 my first political memory was sitting with my mom watching jfks nomination from our living room floor on our tiny black and white television
7190890 thats when i became inspired to get involved in government and politics and from that day forward i wanted to be an official delegate to a convention
7190891 its a very exciting environment and even though the candidate is predetermined its still exciting to be part of the process
7190892 i had the opportunity back in 1996 to meet him and ive kept in touch with him and weve become friends over the years
7190893 its always a thrill as a republican to go to the partys convention and its an honor to represent my state to the national party
7190894 i cant recall three republican delegates and alternates being from one town with the possible exception of greenwich
7190895 the democrats of connecticut are united behind making our nominee barack obama the next president of the united states of america the county is desperate to make a change in washington
7190896 there are very important issues that we have to get straight in this country and the democratic platform is going to be looking towards the future of health care energy and the economy
7190897 im hoping to come back to connecticut from denver with having passed a democratic platform that will address these critical issues and that will set the country back in the right direction that will restore to our country the kinds of leadership and values weve sorely lacked for the past eight years
7190898 we have a very engaging african american guy extremely eloquent the grandson of a tribal leader from africa
7190899 that he can be the nominee and potentially the president of the united states is incredible testimony to the spirit of the american people i just disagree with him completely on the role of government
7190900 members of the media are complicit in making corporations look evil and government the answer to everything it is a long term strategy that we should be wary of
7190901 when you have the government taking care of every little thing freedom is slowly lost i was raised in canada so i saw what socialism did to people it makes them beholden to the government
7190902 my aunt who passed away in 1997 asked for an mri because she had incredible back pain they couldnt schedule the mri until about nine months later she died in august the mri was scheduled for october
7190903 i believe in the free market to reduce medical costs and doctors to determine health care not the government anytime the government gets involved the price goes up if you want the government to control health care think of the dmv everybody gets served eventually but get in line
7190904 changing the nominating calendar for primaries and caucuses for four years from now is an issue that well be looking at
7190905 theres a general consensus among republicans and democrats alike that it should be a little more spread out and start later
7190906 the plan that were looking at would honor the iowa caucus and new hampshire primary they go first its become somewhat of a tradition and we would recognize that
7190907 but then wed basically divide up the other states into four fairly equal pieces
7190908 its important to note that bad news always sells well in the media but when companies are actually adding staff you very rarely see that
7190909 that creates a very unbalanced picture of whats actually happening
7190910 the overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape
7190911 its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what youve got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape yes its slowing but its not slowing unduly
7190912 today is a special day we hope its the beginning we have opened the path and we hope there will be more travelers
7190913 in order to avoid a well publicized provocation in the middle of the sea
7190914 because we know who is on the boats and what they contain we will allow them to land
7190915 enough lebanon will not die today it will not die tomorrow no bombs or bullets from israeli syrian or iranian regimes will ever bring us down
7190916 de esa manera est s aun respetando el estilo individual del artista
7190917 c mo yo me sentir a si recibo este comentario en mi trabajo
7190918 if we have to raise our level of alert well do it
7190919 could be exploited from outside and used as a pretext
7190920 to defend their democracy against attempts by syria iran and allies to foment instability and violence in that important country
7190921 i want all those who loved my son to keep that cause alive
7190922 the white house warned about two weeks ago that syria and iran acting through hizbullah might be on the verge of an attempted coup detat in lebanon one has to wonder whether this despicable assassination is not the first shot
7190923 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7190924 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7190925 we are continuing to raise our concerns at senior levels of the chinese government and to follow their cases closely
7190926 wont just make a good vice president he will make a great vice president
7190927 he is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7190928 this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7190929 the times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7190930 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country

7190934 by bringing these homeless pets to this country were enabling the good people at beta to rebuild their shelters and restart their rescue work
7190935 hariri understood that forcing hizbullah to disarm would have perilous consequences for lebanons stability
7190936 this is the most panicked i have ever seen lebanon
7190937 damascus has the upper hand in lebanon now after nearly a year without any assassinations and hizbullah are getting stronger by the day
7190938 this crime comes at a time when the us and europe are considering reopening talks with syria
7190939 we dont need soldiers at the border with israel but rather at the border with syria
7190940 we remain deeply concerned by syrias ongoing support for hizbullah hizbullahs role in the major outbreak of violence this year with israel included abducting and detaining two israeli soldiers and firing unguided rockets into israeli towns and cities in total hizbullah fired nearly 4 000 rockets into israeli territory
7190941 what we did is not nearly so bad as the holocaust
7190942 we are now calling for unity and accord not for score settling and vengefulness
7190943 we are suggesting a national unity government in a positive spirit
7190944 they are making a profit from the strength of their guerrilla force to come into the capital and to pressure the political apparatus to impose their will on the government
7190945 in many ways it is a system of coexistence of compromise
7190946 but it is also in a way a cold civil war in order for sectarian elites to maintain their power they have to incite sectarianism
7190947 this applies to all other sects too this is how the country is and there is nothing we can do about it
7190948 if you push too hard it will collapse lets keep what we have and not shoot at each other
7190949 we can instigate civil disobedience topple the government and bring about early elections
7190950 but we are not threatening to do this so dont scare us with talk of civil strife or civil war since neither of these is a possibility
7190951 i call on the prime minister and his ministers to quit
7190952 our government are in their offices hiding from us the lebanese people we will stay on the streets until they leave
7190953 we are not asking only for a government of the opposition but we want to be part of the decision making process we will not accept anything less than partnership
7190954 we want a government that represents all lebanese im not with any political party we have come as lebanese its not just the economic situation we want a unified government its not fair that all these people are not represented
7190955 these are the same people that ruled under the syrians the same crooks we want a new government that is responsible and actually works for the good of the country
7190956 this government had a year and a half and they didnt do anything for lebanon there is no work there is no security and there is no honesty from the siniora governmenta
7190957 our people were being killed everyday by israel and they the government were taking orders from its ally america no one from this government has even visited the south yet

7190959 thats the difference in me and some including all of the right wingers who are attacking me now they had eight months to try they did not try i tried
7190960 the party seeks power entirely for its own sake we are not interested in the good of others we are interested solely in power
7190961 one does not establish a dictatorship to safeguard a revolution one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship
7190962 the object of persecution is persecution the object of torture is torture the object of power is power
7190963 we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country
7190964 as a result oft decided to buy several trophies which cost 300 000 400 000 each for battlefield trials on strykers in iraq next year
7190965 that plan immediately ran into a roadblock strong opposition from the u s army why pentagon sources tell nbc news that the army brass considers the israeli system a threat to an army program to develop an rpg defense system from scratch
7190966 the 70 million contract for that program had been awarded to an army favorite raytheon raytheons contract constitutes a small but important part of the armys massive modernization program called the future combat system fcs which has been under fire in congress on account of ballooning costs and what critics say are unorthodox procurement practices
7190967 thats the difference in me and some including all of the right wingers who are attacking me now they had eight months to try they did not try i tried
7190968 the party seeks power entirely for its own sake we are not interested in the good of others we are interested solely in power

7190971 we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country
7190972 we are now preparing a sort of campaign in these countries to show that lebanon the country where their children have come for a peaceful mission is also a beautiful country it has an image that is not only war and destruction
7190973 when they have their leave they go to enjoy a glass of beer or lunch or dinner
7190974 we will probably lose around 2 billion because of war in lebanon
7190975 the tourists came and on the 12th of july they received bombs on their heads and they were obliged to escape in a very humiliating way
7190976 i would say the main thing that has been damaged is confidence in the country i say its easier to rebuild a bridge than to rebuild confidence in a country
7190977 tourism needs stability if there is no stability there is no tourism
7190978 that is not the ultimate mission dont spend your time in a dusty courtroom or a bumpy jeep ride come see the actual buildings that were blown up and the graves of the kids that were killed see an actual hizbollah house that no longer exists
7190979 why then did they not believe with humility but their hearts became hardened and satan made fair seeming to them that which they used to do
7190980 i had thought a lot about having this hairstyle i wanted show everyone a different side of me and i am very satisfied with this hairstyle
7190981 i think it seemed that i was the one who would step into the wedding hall and get married the earliest and i do want to build a home together with the person i love and our baby soon
7190982 being the leader i have to be flexible and quick
7190983 i do like toys and i think like a child
7190984 god was generous to us and granted us this victory against our enemy he was generous to us and gave us sayyed hassan nasrallah so we come here to celebrate with him
7190985 we are willing to respond to sayyed nasrallahs call with our blood children and everything that we own
7190986 what is shocking and completely immoral is 90 of the cluster bomb strikes occurred in the last 72 hours of the conflict when we knew there would be a resolution
7190987 the idf israel defence force does not deliberately attack civilians and takes steps to minimise any incidental collateral harm by warning them in advance of an action even at the expense of losing the element of surprise
7190988 since the end of the war hizbullah guerillas have openly appeared without weapons or uniform
7190989 if everything goes according to plan there will be no idf troops left in lebanon by rosh hashana
7190990 so long as what they tell you seems good listen
7190991 i me i am the only god and there will be no discussion or question in that regard period
7190992 a motorist is kidnapped with his car they then booby trap the car without the driver knowing then the kidnapped driver is released and threatened to take a certain road
7190993 reaches a checkpoint a public place or an army or police patrol the criminal terrorists following the driver detonate the car from a distance
7190994 in the past unifil proved that it did not deal well with hizbullah
7190995 if pellegrini takes the same approach again it could endanger the cease fire and create a conflict sooner than expected
7190996 they will operate in the villages and their bunkers discreetly
7190997 military intelligence recently completed drafting its assessments for 2007 and predicted that hizbullah which it believed was currently interested in quiet so it could rebuild itself would be ready within a year to again wage war against israel war with hizbullah could break out earlier officers said if iran or syria were attacked by israel or the united states
7190998 we shall break the cross and spill the wine god will help muslims to conquer rome god enable us to slit their throats and make their money and descendants the bounty of the mujahideen
7190999 you and the west are doomed as you can see from the defeat in iraq afghanistan chechnya and elsewhere
7191000 you infidels and despots we will continue our jihad holy war and never stop until god avails us to chop your necks and raise the fluttering banner of monotheism when gods rule is established governing all people and nations
7191001 if the stupid pig is prancing with his blasphemies in his house
7191002 then let him wait for the day coming soon when the armies of the religion of right knock on the walls of rome
7191003 those who benefit from the popes comments and drive their own arrogant policies should be targeted with attacks and protests
7191004 the roman pontiff when he speaks ex cathedra that is when in the exercise of his office as pastor and teacher of all christians he defines by virtue of his supreme apostolic authority a doctrine of faith or morals to be held by the whole church is by reason of the divine assistance promised to him in blessed peter possessed of that infallibility with which the divine redeemer wished his church to be endowed in defining doctrines of faith and morals and consequently that such definitions of the roman pontiff are irreformable of their own nature ex sese and not by reason of the churchs consent
7191005 i do think that is done on purpose this is someone who has always voiced his thoughts sometimes brutally he is no diplomat
7191006 lucid and intellectually sound one could wonder whether it was politically opportune
7191007 no there are three distinct parts to the holy trinity jesus was gods son not god himself
7191008 one thing we dont do is argue about who god is or what he means
7191009 you people are nuts i put you there to have fun and you want to make up all these rules to get into heaven when you die you are nuts
7191010 theyre members of the holiness pentecostal faith and they are religious fundamentalists who believe the bible is the inspired word of god that should be taken literally
7191011 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover
7191012 god made rattlesnakes poisonous for a reason he also did not make people immune to the poison for a reason is there a hidden meaning there somewhere
7191013 do we want to hold accountable the government of lebanon
7191014 theres time later to lay blame lets worry about right now
7191015 theres plenty of blame to go around at all levels
7191016 the palestinians could have a great future living in peace with israel and getting a lot of money from europe u s rich gulf states tourists ect all you need to do is let the past go and make peace
7191017 tell me one treaty the indians have broken and tell me one treaty the white man has kept
7191018 tell me one treaty the indians have broken and tell me one treaty the white man has kept
7191019 why should the palestinians want peace with israel their homes have been destroyed they have no economy a fence has been built through the middles of their residential areas they cannot cross borders even to go to work and they are subject to being arrested and jailed on the whim of an israeli soldier even the token members of parliament arent safe
7191020 look at the history beginning with menachem begin in the mid to late 40s
7191021 the case of khaled al masri a german citizen of lebanese descent who was allegedly kidnapped and tortured in secret cia prisons continues to unfold
7191022 munichs s ddeutsche zeitung reported that prosecutors had received a list of names of suspected us kidnappers from spanish officials
7191023 we now have very specific questions for the spanish authorities
7191024 al masri says he was wrongly abducted on new years eve 2003 in macedonia and detained in various secret overseas prisons often referred to as
7191025 we arent saying were coming after syracuse because its ours what are we going to do with syracuse

7191027 i dont hate you anymore and i think israel is a wonderful place
7191028 we can tell people about christ and actually show you in our walk that we forgive not just say it but in our walk of life
7191029 i dont hate you anymore and i think israel is a wonderful place
7191030 we can tell people about christ and actually show you in our walk that we forgive not just say it but in our walk of life
7191031 israel is always going to be there live with it
7191032 what israel should be doing is finding a way to have palestinians say
7191033 shit we have to deal with you now because you are always going to be here
7191034 engaging in deceptive advertising practices designed to persuade ineligible users that they could legally purchase and operate wireless microphones operating on vacant broadcast uhf channels
7191035 for me im able to be persuaded and often if i believe that the evidence is strong then im happy to change my mind and thats what ive done
7191036 the job of the police association now will be to monitor the transition from the antiquated revolver to the semi automatic pistol
7191037 we hope that transition will occur in a timely manner
7191038 the current revolver goes back to the days of gallipoli
7191039 we are going to see a mass shooting in tasmania unless we get national gun control laws
7191040 i became aware that the only 2 local police were dispatched to saltwater river i was chatting to the nubeena policeman and he told me where he was when the shooting began his name is paul hyland the other policeman was stationed at dunalley he would back up hyland as they were told heroin soap powder was found at saltwater river
7191041 this meant that the only 2 local police were at least 25 minutes away from port arthur very convenient i dont know when where or who rang and alerted the police to this so called heroin haul
7191042 i know it should have been on tape but i went to hobart about a week after the shooting to a meeting of the ambulance service a comment was made to me that the tape recordings of the days events had been accidentally wiped the chap who told me was a senior ambulance officer i travelled with him to the meeting and it was during this journey that i was given this information
7191043 would also prevent anyone from leaving the peninsula including those involved in executing the massacre at port arthur
7191044 the bridge remained open to traffic after the massacre and several people are known to have left port arthur and escaped across that swing bridge
7191045 there was some suggestion that there may be two suspects it appeared at one stage that two gunmen or some people or hostages at seascape were exchanging gunfire with the gunmen as there appeared to be shots coming from two separate buildings
7191046 your honour nothing that i can say on behalf of my client can mitigate the outrageous nature of his conduct
7191047 i felt intensely that i had to do right by the community as well
7191048 there will never be national firearm laws until there is a massacre in tasmania
7191049 it is amazing how a creature so fragile can achieve such immeasurable superiority

7191053 catching teardrops in my hand my heart is drenched in wine i feel as empty as a drum i dont know why i didnt come
7191054 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7191055 like so many people around the world i have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration
7191056 to all the participants and to everyone who has supported them so well i send my warmest congratulations
7191057 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7191058 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7191059 strike action is a last resort for our members who provide an invaluable service in ensuring the safety of shipping in british waters
7191060 the latest action could have been avoided if the government and the maritime and coastguard agency mca hadnt continued with their refusal to negotiate a satisfactory outcome
7191061 members have rightly grown angry at the scandalous refusal to pay them the same as other emergency service workers and by the governments policy to cap public sector pay increases below inflation
7191062 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that
7191063 i think when people are looking at the olympics in 2012 britain home of football where football was invented which we gave to the world i think people would be very surprised if there is an olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it
7191064 i am determined to work with the football associations and the olympic committee to ensure that when we come to 2012 we have a mens football team and we have a womens football team playing
7191065 this is a spectacular own goal for brown he is out of touch with the overwhelming views of football supporters throughout the uk
7191066 all the national supporters groups oppose this move and see it as a threat to the status of their nations to field independent football squads
7191067 im an east end boy and im proud that its happening in london i was very proud to be involved in the first place bringing it back to england and to london its going to generate so much interest in sport and kids are already getting excited about it
7191068 we have seen what the chinese have done here and im sure we will better that without a doubt
7191069 not this time but you made the long list so well played
7191070 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
7191071 any such talk of secession is preposterous and in conflict with constitution and law of the land
7191072 the countrys borders cannot be altered or redrawn and constitution cannot be rewritten
7191073 his comment came in the backdrop of calls for secession of jammu and kashmir made by separatist leaders as well as a few prominent people like author arundhuti roy sharma said prime minister manmohan singh had maintained that all issues can be resolved through dialogue
7191074 those with separatist agenda cannot claim to be representatives of people those who have never contested elections cant claim to represent people

7191165 all the albertsons employees are getting the run around from publix
7191166 theyve been so arrogant and condescending to me and many other albertsons employees
7191167 my feeling is if were good enough to work for albertsons were good enough to work for publix
7191168 our clientele is very loyal to albertsons i dont understand why publix would treat us this way its been very hurtful
7191169 im hearing winn dixie is coming in hiring albertsons employees left and right
7191170 the heavier rains are east and north of the center
7191171 it looks like its going to move parallel north of interstate 10 everythings iffy right now
7191172 we are able to scale back a bit because the forecast didnt look like we were going to be faced with protective actions like evacuations
7191173 friends and family are always the best place to go to
7191174 many people feel comfortable at a church if you have nowhere to go go to the shelter at pensacola high school
7191175 we do expect road flooding especially along our rivers and streams
7191176 red flags will continue to fly and people should still stay out of the water
7191177 the economic reforms have created new opportunities new dreams and to some extent a new atmosphere and new mindsets there is a growing sense of increased space for personal freedom
7191178 billions of entrepreneurs how china and india are reshaping their futures and yours
7191179 america as seen by everyone who might have gotten shafted
7191180 apparently we bought too small a dress for georgia to wear and therefore its our fault

7191182 when you walk into here and see what youre going to be able to do you cant help but get excited
7191183 quality health care close to home for our veterans is critical
7191184 this new facility will bring state of the art equipment and procedures to the greater pensacola area and will lessen the requirement for veterans to make long trips for their medical care
7191185 local veterans have been saying for a number of years that the current clinic is undersized for the number of visitors they have
7191186 this new facility quadruples the size of the old clinic
7191187 there are a lot of vets around the country that have never experienced a new facility but in florida because of the growth weve been very fortunate to get a lot of dollars for facilities
7191188 were shoulder to shoulder with the navy working together to do whats best for the vets
7191189 we want them to feel like this is home like this is a good place to come get their care
7191190 we did that for the veterans it helps guide them through the building and it also reminds them who they are and what they used to do
7191191 its been an extremely rewarding experience because as far as we are concerned our patients are no 1
7191192 those old timers didnt want to teach us anything because they didnt want us to become the competition
7191193 when you go into the voting booth youre not voting for the picture
7191194 he treats people right gives great customer service offers a fair price and has done so consistently for years
7191195 you can always count on him to be there bottom line he works hard and thats the only way a small business like his can survive and prosper
7191196 i think hes a unique individual and really loves what he does to say the least
7191197 he gave us a little education on how his signs were produced you can tell by all the signs on the walls that hes done a lot of work over the years for some very influential people in the area and throughout florida
7191198 rise to the challenge of defining themselves as an ethical nation
7191199 you may appear nice but we know there are sleeper cells of americans
7191200 please suggest any comprehensive work of tafseer quranic commentary for us muslim youth
7191201 islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and programme of islam regardless of the country or the nation which rules it the purpose of islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and programme regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard bearer of islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological islamic state it must be evident to you from this discussion that the objective of islamic jihad is to eliminate the rule of an un islamic system and establish in its stead an islamic system of state rule islam does not intend to confine this revolution to a single state or a few countries the aim of islam is to bring about a universal revolution
7191202 islamic jihad does not recognize their right to administer state affairs according to a system which in the view of islam is evil furthermore islamic jihad also refuses to admit their right to continue with such practices under an islamic government which fatally affect the public interest from the viewpoint of islam
7191203 these kinds of statements are really irresponsible because they can lead to violence against ordinary people i dont see any difference between that and al qaeda and osama bin laden using islamic theology to justify violence against americans whats interesting is if you compare their statements about what islam is and what muslims believe youll find they are almost identical and i reject both interpretations both the non muslims who are saying that islam justifies violence against christians and jews and the muslims who are saying it certainly these statements have a very unnerving effect especially when they continue when more than one person says it
7191204 as a practicing muslim i believe that there is a core of fundamental beliefs and practices that distinguish authentic islam from deviations
7191205 im convinced that it is not only inaccurate but unhelpful if our major concern is security security of this country this is a term that has very bad resonance in the muslim majority world and makes us feel uncomfortable here
7191206 the products that are coming from the muslim world are not being called islamic products or islamic oil
7191207 i believe that many americans believe that muslim women dont have any rights in islam perhaps they see images of muslim women being oppressed in different parts of the muslim world and believe that that is because of their religion but in fact we know that muslim women have the same rights as muslim men and virtually all the same duties and obligations
7191208 one of the popular misconceptions about islam is that women are seen as lesser figures that they dont have rights
7191209 this perception that women in islam are oppressed is based both on misinformation as well as am amplification of certain unfortunate tendencies in some parts of the muslim world its true that people have seen some muslim authorities using islam as a justification for the oppression or suppression of women thats a reality we cant deny it but we have to balance those incidents with whats going on in the rest of the muslim world in which most women are participating in their societies weve seen that within recent times four muslim majority nations have had female heads of state in most countries that ive traveled to muslim women are involved in all aspects of society
7191210 mattson muslim women have the same legal rights as muslim men the prophet mohammeds wife was a businesswoman in fact he met her working for her as her agent the legal rights of women were enshrined in islamic law however cultural practices in many societies have prevented those rights from being enforced
7191211 that can be frustrating i want to also make sure people understand that although american muslims do have a responsibility to clarify their views on terrorism and violence done in the name of islam we dont have control over these situations we dont have some sort of magic power over all muslims in the world
7191212 right wing christians are very risky allies for american jews mattson said because they the christians are really anti semitic they do not like jews and enter into the alliance on the basis of fundamentalist beliefs that it would be desirable for all jews to return to israel she suggested that fundamentalist christians might turn against jews or that there could be backlash from ordinary americans against jewish and fundamentalist christian supporters of israel
7191213 the american government has not criticized sufficiently the brutality of the israeli government believing that it needs to be
7191214 thus it is not permitted for a muslim to maintain a close friendship with a highly intelligent person who engages him or her in stimulating conversation if that person continuously derides the sacred quran 5 57 58 indeed since preserving faith is the highest priority it is important that muslims avoid demoralizing dependence on other faith communities for their protection and material needs clearly there are groups among american christians and jews who are so hostile to muslims that we should not join with them even in shared concerns lest we lend any credibility to their organizations there are many other groups within those communities however who are eager to work respectfully with muslims to further just causes
7191215 we see candidates being asked to prove that they comply with an ever narrower definition of what it means to be a christian forget about being a muslim or a jew
7191216 i used to play football right there in the road
7191217 hes got the rushing record and im trying to follow in his footsteps but im not emmitt
7191218 he told me im not going to get his record just kidding around
7191219 hes getting better but is he better than emmitt was
7191220 no i dont think so but after coaching emmitt and seeing some of the things he could do well trent is bigger faster and stronger than emmitt was but he doesnt have the intangibles and knowledge of the game yet that emmitt did but hes working hard to get there
7191221 when he visits a college campus hes bigger than most of the running backs there
7191222 even if youre not a good football player dreads make you feel like youre good
7191223 i never had all the fancy wrist bands and things like that
7191224 but hes always in the weight room by himself hes always working out he wants to get stronger and better thats the kind of guy trent is
7191225 for trent to be the superstar well we all have to be part of that
7191226 trent has become a very big team leader but he wasnt in the beginning
7191227 but hes learned that we win or lose as a team
7191228 now when the team falls short he knows its us if the team wins he knows its us its like he went from a boy to a man in a split second
7191229 everyone always expects him to do something great and he usually does but this year hes putting it on us
7191230 he really wants to make us better hell do what he can for the team i dont have a car and if my moms at work hell come and pick me up he doesnt have a big head or act like a star
7191231 the offensive linemen theyre bringing in are going to be good i dont look at the quarterback and the running backs i look at the offensive line because theyre the ones who get it done
7191232 it was my mother and grandmother and brothers who i was closest to
7191233 it was just us my mother always had to work for everything but we never had a lot just what we needed there were a lot of times when we were just eating peanut butter and jelly we never had the fancy clothes or things that everyone else had its been tough on her
7191234 ive got to make sure i dont mess up i have to make sure i go to class every day and take care of my responsibilities and my family is my responsibility
7191235 the money is out there i grew up in warrington village and here on merritt street it was tough but its all good now
7191236 in my heart i believe that he will say yes
7191237 if there is in principle support from the australia government we would form working groups to look at how many people and where
7191238 i believe the prime minister would be very keen to see some east timorese workers come and assist us with the mango harvest
7191239 getting people to work getting people an education getting skills is the best defence against a further uprising in timor leste
7191240 we need to find ways where we can have a win for east timor provide some support there as well as fill a need here
7191241 however we must never reduce our effort to bridge that gap from welfare to work here
7191242 i was a little bit nervous in the beginning of the third set i got my rhythm back i was really pumped up when i had to be really enjoyed the moment in the end
7191243 nine times losing ive got a lot of runner up trophies in my office in my house these are the ones i need to get
7191244 ok magazine talks to britney spears this week and the main topic of conversation seems to have been how she got back into such good shape
7191245 every activity we do from here on will be analyzed and scrutinized in china for the past year almost every last thing that happened there was reported globally well thats going to start happening to us
7191246 we dont see them as a negative they are something we value they happen in communities right across the country we accept it and thats the way it is
7191247 its just what people do in canada when they want to make a point about something and canadians do it as well as anybody
7191248 i did expect that there would be more people gathering at night out on the streets
7191249 we want people to celebrate every night we want to give everyone a chance to be part of the games a sense of ownership over the olympics
7191250 our goal is to share the games with every citizen
7191251 its a complex challenge but we believe we can do better than our predecessors
7191252 we will have 1 6 million tickets compared with 6 8 million in beijing and the 15 sports of the winter olympics are all very well known
7191253 one of the big problems at other olympics is the number of sports the host country is unfamiliar with so we are in a much better position
7191254 we have much smaller spaces and the flow of people is a problem we are going to have to meet head on
7191255 i really dont think people are going to compare the two games a month from now people will remember beijing and then move on we have a very good reputation in the world and weve made our games about the whole country
7191256 thats unique for the olympics and our expectations of delivering a magnificent games are very high

7191260 he is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7191261 this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7191262 the times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7191263 i dont oppose all wars what i am opposed to is a dumb war i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and encourage the worst rather than best impulses of the arab world
7191264 but beneath his incompetence and insolence there was a character and sense of duty worth not just taking seriously but honouring
7191265 mccain and obama are two evenly matched larger than life figures with riveting biographies
7191266 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7191267 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7191268 we are continuing to raise our concerns at senior levels of the chinese government and to follow their cases closely
7191269 today the iranian nation has obtained the technology to produce different kinds of satellites and with gods help it will launch its first telecommunications satellite into space

7191275 as a precautionary measure curfew has been imposed from 4 a m 2230 gmt today
7191276 curfew is in force please dont come out of your homes
7191277 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7191278 such repressive measures will not work we will emerge stronger and more vibrant
7191279 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
7191280 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
7191281 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
7191282 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
7191283 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
7191284 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
7191285 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
7191286 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
7191287 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
7191288 im in favor of another agreement whatever it takes to stop the conflict but you know it just cannot have as a tradeoff the criminals going scott free

7191302 because of that the information that they can give us is much more valuable
7191303 as a political military project the farc is a failure
7191304 once you join the farc you are to remain a guerrilla until the revolution triumphs
7191305 even from prison you are supposed to figure out ways to help the farc

7191324 just last week the prime minister gave his personal commitment to the program
7191325 they are well aware of the sacrifices the sons of iraq have made that they were a critical element in bringing the security situation under control and that it is in their strategic advantage to assimilate them peacefully and orderly into iraqi society

7191363 i thought he was great tonight particularly after coming off a really bad start
7191364 i got a long way to go to redeem myself
7191365 im not going to sit here and i said it last time im not going to sit on a good win just because i had a bad start before and now things are better
7191366 i owe a lot more to myself and this team this year to i guess redeem myself im proud of this start im going to take the positives of this start and try to mimic them for my next start but in no way shape or form am i totally redeemed from the two bad starts that have been among the last four
7191367 you know this is the time of year when you get a little tired you appreciate games like this because they dont come around as often as they do early in the season when you feel fresh and when you have good bat speed
7191368 tonight was a good night it was a game that we really needed to win brandon came out and established a good tempo or tone for the game and we were able to score some runs it was a good night for us all the way around
7191369 i watched what roy did and kind of used what i could use from him and then i had the stuff to figure it out on my own how to get them out i just had the stuff i had a plan and the execution was there
7191370 its always a little bit easier when you get some runs earlier in the ballgame
7191371 it allows the pitcher to go out and relax i thought brandon was very very sharp he attacked the zone pretty good

7191482 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7191483 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7191484 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7191485 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that

7191503 sumpah laknat yang terdapat dalam islam di disebut sebagai sumpah lian iaitu sumpah yang hanya dilakukan oleh pasangan suami isteri sekiranya berlaku pertuduhan zina yang tidak berjaya dibuktikan kegagalan masyarakat islam hari ini memahami perundangan islam telah menyebabkan timbul pelbagai kekeliruan di kalangan masyarakat kerana tidak kembali kepada ajaran islam dan berpegang dengan ajaran al quran dan hadis
7191504 pasal itu maka umat islam sepatutnya mengambil iktibar dari kejadian mutahir ini yang kebetulan pula kejadian sekarang berlaku hampir pada pilihanraya adakah ia untuk kegunaan pilihanraya atau tidak tuan tuan menjadi hakim tetapi saya bimbang apabila hal hal yang menyentuh hukum agama allah ini ada orang yang mempermudahkan hukum islam itu lalu menjadi haru biru

7191543 hiring wayt provides an opportunity to conduct a search for a city manager that is not under the pressure of time automatically imposed by having an interim person in the job

7191552 the rating criteria didnt help us grade the projects comprehensively
7191553 the board really couldnt put off moving forward on these much needed repairs because to do so would just compound the cost and increase the risk of harm to students staff and community members who use these facilities

7191791 my crooked parking company locked me out of my account its clear that theyre closing my account because they owe me 10 500 usd in click revenues for my newly registered hot domain veryveryveryslipperysnakesandweasels info i know the traffic was valid because i clicked on the ads myself what can i do
7191792 help my domains were stolen i sold 6 three letter dot coms to a buyer with an account at anon petit fi as agreed i transferred the domains to him but he never wired me the money if there are any attorneys online i would appreciate a week or two of free legal services
7191793 i bought a two letter dot com from some guy on the internet after wiring him the money he never transferred the domain i cant prove that he even owned the domain since it has a private domain registration any suggestions
7191794 my domain registrar is a crook its true that a huge number of fortune 500 corporations trust them with their intellectual property but i cant believe that they have the audacity to charge more than 1 what it costs them to process domains through the registry sure they deserve to make a profit but 50 cents per domain per year should be plenty to operate their servers and pay expenses
7191795 de cijfers tonen aan dat de havens van amsterdam een stabiele economische factor voor de amsterdamse regio blijven
7191796 dat verplicht ons om met nog meer urgentie na te denken over manieren waarop we deze groei duurzaam kunnen ondersteunen
7191797 dieren en planten leven op en in het schip het geeft hen beschutting daardoor wordt de locatie voor de duikers weer aantrekkelijker
7191798 het is op dit moment lastig vanwege de hoge oud ijzerprijs een oud schip brengt momenteel tussen de 20 000 en 40 000 euro op dat is voor ons te veel we hebben een aantal objecten in beeld gehad maar ze waren te duur of te klein we zoeken iets van minimaal 15 tot 20 meter een bootje van 8 meter is op die locatie gewoon te klein
7191799 dat gebied is geschikt voor zowel beginnende als gevorderde duikers
7191800 je kunt in deze branche geen jaren in het voren kijken
7191801 maar zoals de ontwikkelingen nu zijn sluit ik niet uit dat we over een paar jaar weer alles in eigen huis doen
7191802 we haalden de laatste jaren cascos uit roemeni en oekra ne maar dat is niet meer zo voordelig als het was we halen nu nog wel onderdelen uit polen daar wordt goed werk geleverd maar de wisselkoersen zijn nadelig ja polen krijgt ook de euro maar daar wordt het niet goedkoper van
7191803 we nemen niet deel in die werven omdat je in het buitenland toch nooit controle hebt
7191804 we denken er zelfs nu al aan die hal nog eens te verdubbelen waardoor we nog meer kunnen produceren
7191805 als je nu een motor bestelt wordt die geleverd in 2012
7191806 dan vijfentwintig jaar een te duur schip mee te torsen
7191807 we zijn behoorlijk positief over 2009 op basis van wat we in handen hebben
7191808 het ziet er simpel uit maar in al zijn eenvoud werkt het perfect
7191809 we noemen dat de schelp die remt de snelheid van de brug af en zorgt ervoor dat de brugklap keurig vergrendeld wordt staan ze boven te mopperen hoor zo van is die brug al dicht en we moeten nog wachten dat licht blijft maar op rood staan ze weten niet dat het even duurt voor de brug goed vergrendeld is wel belangrijk veiligheid gaat voor alles
7191810 wij hebben niets te maken met het schutten van de schepen die de sluizen in en uitvaren
7191811 we moeten de doorvaart garanderen dat staat allemaal in de akte van mannheim die destijds door diverse landen ondertekend is dat houdt dus ook in dat we de boel goed moeten onderhouden
7191812 de bediening is nog altijd een knoppenbediening in de centrale bediening staat een grote lessenaar met knoppen drie bij een meter het hele complex draait voor 95 procent op dezelfde techniek die veertig jaar geleden ingevoerd werd 5 procent is gemoderniseerd computerbesturing
7191813 het bewijs dat het destijds een goed ontwerp was en goede spullen gebruikt zijn het werkt allemaal nog goed
7191814 het rendement is ruim 98 procent echte stremmingen komen hier vrijwel niet voor omdat we drie sluiskolken hebben we kunnen altijd uitwijken bovendien hebben we ook nog de jachtsluis die buiten het seizoen ook voor de beroepsvaart gebruikt wordt
7191815 dan schakelen we meteen over op een noodstroomaggregaat en blijft alles doordraaien we moeten ons tenslotte aan die ondertekende akte uit mannheim houden
7191816 een voordeel is dan dat je op je pc sneller storingen ziet en dus sneller maatregelen kan nemen nu moet je ter plekke gaan kijken als er wat aan de hand is tijd kost geld dat weet iedereen
7191817 we hebben hier puntdeuren die worden dichtgedrukt er zijn ook roldeuren krammer sluizen en de sluizen bij terneuzen en hefdeuren kreekraksluizen vroeger liepen de mensen over de sluismuren heen en weer om die deuren te lokaal te bedienen nu is er een centrale bediening inderdaad nog wel met het knoppenpaneel
7191818 alles wat er aan koperkabels ligt wordt vervangen ik denk dat er na het werk 90 procent minder besturingkabels ligt met de nieuwe technieken kun je met minder veel meer doen
7191819 het is een electrohydraulische aandrijving e n cylinder voor een puntdeur per hoofd hebben we vier puntdeuren in totaal dus 24 deuren dus ook 24 hydraulische powerpacts zoals we dat noemen als je hier loopt en een eindje verder over de brug rijdt heb je eigenlijk geen idee wat er allemaal onder de grond zit ook dat is gigantisch en indrukwekkend
7191820 we lopen naar het centraal bedieningshuis dat ook al zijn langste tijd heeft gehad binnen hangt het ontwerp voor het nieuwe bedieningsgebouw dat hangt er al jaren
7191821 im having some trouble with language she said she really liked you and loved you and would like to smoke corn and eat it with you
7191822 if as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them come let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other
7191823 8 so the lord scattered them from there over all the earth and they stopped building the city 9 that is why it was called babel because there the lord confused the language of the whole world from there the lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth
7191824 zeeland speelt een steeds belangrijkere rol bij de doorvoer van goederen naar het achterland en die rol zal de komende jaren alleen maar groeien daarom hebben de scholen en wij in overleg met het expertise en innovatie centrum van de binnenvaartorganisaties besloten tot dit initiatief

7191840 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
7191841 i am astonished by the audacity to tell such lies about me
7191842 thats when we said just give us our truck and leave the store
7191843 the last thing we want is to have a customer arrested we just wanted our truck back
7191844 its saying if you dont agree with us we will call the police and report you
7191845 i think the best way to call for help is by yelling together
7191846 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses
7191847 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7191848 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7191849 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7191850 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7191851 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7191852 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7191853 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7191854 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7191855 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7191856 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7191857 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7191858 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7191859 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7191860 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7191861 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7191862 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7191863 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7191864 try to use that word or those words more often
7191865 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7191866 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7191867 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7191868 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7191869 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7191870 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7191871 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7191872 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7191873 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7191874 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7191875 put your sword back into its place for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword or do you think that i cannot appeal to my father and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels
7191876 he was for a long time the man over there in the prosecutors office

7191888 gnomedex founder chris pirillo is good at keeping an audience why because he writes good stuff either you write good stuff or you write crap bottom line
7191889 i consider my blog a loss leader for my other businesses
7191890 i do all of those things but ultimately my blog is the heart of it
7191891 from the beginning of my blog in 2004 i decided its not about driving traffic its about driving influence
7191892 from the beginning i said i wasnt going to overblog i was only going to blog when i had something to say
7191893 is that the audience is starting to follow me its really about people wanting to hear what i have to say

7191946 the conditions were very good a little humid i had to push the pace to tire the others i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7191947 this may be a silly question but what did any of you want to do when you grew up before you became a mutant
7191948 i had a teacher in elementary school who made teaching so much fun for me even though i had bullies picking on me for being a small girl she made going to school seem much more worthwhile
7191949 she must be a remarkable individual to have inspired you
7191950 and you caleb do you still want to be a fireman with what you can do now
7191951 i dunno i mean i certainly cant become one now
7191952 oh i can become either water or fire depending on whats near me and a big raging bonfire ive not figured out how to control it properly
7191953 caleb can also manipulate the element hes become in a limited degree the reason hes here is to try to gain greater control and learn an useful purpose for it
7191954 many mutants initially arrive here without realizing they can use their abilities to help all of us mutants and humans that is the reason i founded this academy i strongly believe in peaceful coexistance
7191955 alright everyones dismissed until tuesday no classes will be taking place on monday
7191956 of course tad would you mind staying a moment longer i have the results from your testing
7191957 ill let you two talk i have to change for my next class anyway ill stop by then
7191958 blunt and to the point good i went over the results last night and have concluded that you are capable of healing and teleportation this much you probably realize
7191959 well the unique thing about this is your powers seem to derive from one source of energy at one time what this means is that you can either teleport or heal providing you have sufficient reserves
7191960 put more simply the more energy you utilize for one power the less there is for the other
7191961 wait you mean if i dont teleport i could heal more serious injuries
7191962 thats more or less the gist of it you have a battery like capacity inside you that gets depleted whenever you access either power resulting in a more limited teleporting range or less healing strength
7191963 rest primarily a full nights rest should fully revitalize you
7191964 well we havent ascertained the exact range of your teleportation yet but the readings did indicate that your power levels dropped very slightly whenever you accessed your powers within the confines of the danger room walls
7191965 your healing ability did take more out of you than your teleportation did overall in the testing
7191966 i uh am kinda still finding this a bit much to process though
7191967 thats entirely understandable give it time if theres nothing else i have another class in a half hour feel free to wander around the public areas
7191968 im not sure im the right person to keep an eye on tad
7191969 um how do you know for sure if a dream you had was a memory or something else
7191970 well is it possible to see whether somethings a memory or a dream inside someones mind
7191971 very well have a seat i do require you to try to recall all of the details of that dream and keep it fixed in your mind
7191972 are you prepared fix the dream you had in your mind as clearly as you can and ill verify it
7191973 yes i have seen many different memories in the past even those that materialize in a dream see memories are like linear thoughts where dreams tend to be surreal and more symbolic in nature
7191974 nothing really surprises me anymore and no do not worry i do not care who you pursue a relationship with as long as it doesnt hurt anyone men or women
7191975 do you have an attraction toward someone perhaps tad is that why you said you couldnt fulfill my request
7191976 i see brenda seems to already be his friend i shant force you to do anything treat him gently if you engage him in conversation
7191977 he needs to work through his trauma and i do not want you to add to it if at all possible
7191978 if theres nothing else i have class in a few minutes
7191979 maybe if blacks actually took responsibilty for their actions like keeping their legs closed before marriage and not squeezing out litters of kids in a single parent home this problem may fixed three out of four black children are born into single family homes maybe if blacks actually made going to school getting a job and working goals

7192002 so a plan was formed that the next time king hamad was visiting london he would meet a group of them
7192003 the king himself obviously enjoyed the occasion professing pride that bahrain was the first arab country to appoint a jewish ambassador to anywhere let alone washington
7192004 we never take notice of religion it is citizens that count it is nothing to do with israel it is our normal business with america
7192005 speaking of the meeting with his ex pats king hamad said it was simply business as usual
7192006 the king eschewed the traditional dish dasha robe and shumagg headdress in favour of a tan coloured suit striped shirt and striped tie
7192007 when he arrived the guests were ushered into a room to meet him individually
7192008 he said he was very proud of his jewish subjects who
7192009 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
7192010 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
7192011 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
7192012 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
7192013 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
7192014 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
7192015 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
7192016 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
7192017 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
7192018 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
7192019 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
7192020 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
7192021 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
7192022 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
7192023 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
7192024 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
7192025 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
7192026 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
7192027 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
7192028 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
7192029 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
7192030 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
7192031 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
7192032 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
7192033 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
7192034 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
7192035 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
7192036 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
7192037 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
7192038 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
7192039 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
7192040 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
7192041 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
7192042 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

7192067 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008
7192068 as a consequence other currencies particularly the euro are poised to weaken the us dollars dominance as the currency of choice for international remittances and payments

7192110 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
7192111 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
7192112 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child

7192114 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

7192213 its okay to spend this much on a building because its for something
7192214 yeah well other studies show that cows dont know what the fuck is going on on a television and at best appreciate some colors and sounds

7192222 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7192223 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7192224 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7192225 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7192226 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7192227 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7192228 hey why not convince him hes a glass of milk instead and that theres no reason to cry over spilled milk
7192229 he started to harass me in february this year and threatened to release my nude photos if i failed to pay him rm11 100
7192230 we cant afford a shopping trip when a quarter of the nation lives on food aid
7192231 we need to keep that money for arvs anti retrovirals
7192232 klopt kan ik die morgen ophalen voor herman is het belangrijk om ze weer te hebben hij is bang dat je ze weggooit het geeft hem rust als hij ze weer ziet en het laat hem ook weer tekenen
7192233 he hans leuk dat je er bent robert zit in de kamer doe je jas uit en kom binnen
7192234 luister robert vanmiddag is die herman langs geweest samen met henk en wat andere pati nten hij had tekeningen mee en wilde alsnog een galerie ik heb het helaas moeten afwijzen omdat ik anderen op het oog heb en herman heb weggestreept van mijn lijstje nu heeft herman zijn tekeningen laten liggen en nog steeds vind ik ze schitterend
7192235 nou die herman was erg teleurgesteld toen ik zei dat er voorlopig geen ruimte voor hem was nu wil ik eigenlijk hem wel voorrang geven en hem over anderhalve maand de ruimte geven vind je dat ik dat kan maken tegenover de andere tekenaars
7192236 je hebt zijn tekeningen niet gezien maar het is echt bijzonder
7192237 herman morgen ga ik je tekeningen ophalen bij hans hij heeft ze nog niet weggegooid vind je dat goed
7192238 het volgende liedje schreef ik voor een meisje van zeventien jaar ik was toen ook zeventien
7192239 het volgende liedje schreef ik ook toen ik 17 was
7192240 dit moet ik in mijn dagboek schrijven dit geloven ze later nooit
7192241 we gaan nu een risico nemen door een liedje te doen van hendriks
7192242 nu we het toch over de hemel hebben kan ik nu wel zeggen dat ik het volgende lied opdraag aan mijn vader
7192243 ik heb ook al wat tekeningen meegenomen voor de galerie
7192244 ik moet je helaas teleurstellen herman ik heb iemand anders op het oog
7192245 kun je dan cht niets meer regelen op korte termijn
7192246 nu zal hans mijn tekeningen vast en zeker weggooien heb ik die tekeningen voor niets uitgezocht ik ben mijn tekeningen kwijt
7192247 dan teken je thuis toch nog gewoon opnieuw wat tekeningen
7192248 herman is niet zichzelf meer hij tekent niet meer en zijn been trilt we moeten hem weer op gang helpen door zijn tekeningen terug te halen
7192249 misschien heb je wel gelijk ik ga morgen weer naar wierden zou ik moeten bellen denk je
7192250 nou je kunt wel bellen om te zeggen dat hij de tekeningen klaarlegt anders vergeet je ze weer dat zou helemaal zonde zijn morgen ben je vrij toch
7192251 jesus is calling hes coming back to gether his jewels
7192252 stuur lazarus dan naar mijn broers een opgestane dode zullen ze vast wel geloven
7192253 mozes is genoeg als je dat niet geloofd zul je ook niet geloven dat iemand uit de dood opstaat
7192254 jongens ik heb een vervelende mededeling ik heb de tekeningen niet meegekregen
7192255 luister ik heb de tekeningen niet meegekregen omdat hans van mening is veranderd hij gaat over anderhalve maand een tentoonstelling openen met het werk van herman maar dat moet voor herman een verrassing blijven dus niemand mag dit aan hem vertellen afgesproken
7192256 met jan van der sanden de vader van herman ik was benieuwd hoe ver het is met die galerie van onze zoon
7192257 het gaat goed we hebben een verrassing voor uw zoon want hij weet niet dat over een paar weken de opening is van de galerie
7192258 nog een vraagje misschien erg onbescheiden maar hoe zit het met de opbrengst van de hermans tekeningen
7192259 die gaat naar de rekening van herman waar hij zelf beperkt bij kan
7192260 ik denk dat jullie het erg leuk gaan vinden vandaag
7192261 ik denk dat je het heel leuk zult gaan vinden
7192262 jij de eerste anderhalve week ik de tweede anderhalve week
7192263 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
7192264 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7192265 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7192266 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7192267 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7192268 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7192269 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7192270 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7192271 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7192272 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7192273 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7192274 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7192275 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7192276 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7192277 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7192278 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7192279 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7192280 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7192281 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7192282 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7192283 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7192284 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7192285 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7192286 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7192287 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7192288 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7192289 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7192290 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7192291 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7192292 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7192293 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7192294 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7192295 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7192296 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7192297 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
7192298 uno de ellos es el asamble sta dem crata adriano espaillat
7192299 this is a decision about parenting vulnerability and vaccine attitudes not sexuality
7192300 mothers who havent had their daughter vaccinated yet most often said they want more time to learn about the vaccine

7192305 die entscheidung zugunsten der d nen geht in ordnung wir haben uns deshalb an dem protest nicht beteiligt silber oder bronze macht zwar einen unterschied f r uns aber die d nen sind die ganze woche super gesegelt wir h tten sie gerne auf dem wasser geschlagen aber nicht am gr nen tisch
7192306 dass wir im langj hrigen vergleich der spiele unterdurchschnittlich unterwegs waren
7192307 man hat schon vorher gesehen dass einzelne sportarten berhaupt nicht mehr maximal mit einem athleten oder berhaupt nur einem eher chancenlosen vertreten waren
7192308 es kann nicht sein dass die politik millionen aus steuergeldern in den sport investiert und sich dann mit einem schweigegel bde zu verabschieden hat
7192309 so etwas muss aber innerhalb der verb nde m glich sein und darf nicht nur dann dann erfolgreich sein wenn es quasi als privatunternehmen wie der familienbetrieb jukic gef hrt wird
7192310 topsport austria h tte damals steiners trainer w nsche gerne erf llt aber der gewichtheberverband hat ihn lieber nach teppichland geschickt und sich selbst damit ins niemandsland gef hrt da darf die politik nicht zuschauen
7192311 aber nat rlich gibt es dann einige pr sidenten und vizepr sidenten weniger
7192312 on review of the entire record we will grant the motion to reopen so that fernandez and her husbands claim for asylum and relief can be re evaluated in light of the new evidence the board said in its decision
7192313 we are not out of the woods yet davis said
7192314 but this is very good news we are very delighted
7192315 i often think about how brenda has been on this roller coaster for almost six years in this country in addition to the tragic life she had in guatemala and i dont know how she has kept her spirit johnson said
7192316 then i realize brenda is fighting for her life and for her freedom and this is what keeps her going each day he added
7192317 we are so fortunate to live in a country that is based on freedom and justice for all and brenda is fighting for those rights
7192318 she doesnt understand what is going on at her age so i told her that a doctor had to put it on for my health fernandez said last week
7192319 it is not important how much time it will take fernandez told me
7192320 i will continue to do everything they ask or order of me i will continue particularly for my daughter i want her to grow up here and i cant express or thank everybody enough who has helped me with this struggle
7192321 chalo acha ha now i can look for a girl for u
7192322 la crisis no ha terminado y no podr a estimar exactamente cu ndo ni c mo finalizar
7192323 mientras persista la crisis veremos m s instituciones financieras en problemas y todo ser a n m s doloroso para la econom a mundial en lo que resta de a o
7192324 las instituciones financieras todav a necesitan recortar los pr stamos y fortalecer sus balances mediante aumentos de capital adicionales y la venta de activos lo que perjudicar a las empresas para financiar sus actividades a largo plazo
7192325 mientras siga la crisis vamos a ver muchas quiebras empresariales
7192326 antes los banqueros actuaban como abogados de sus clientes ahora ya nadie se comporta as
7192327 fue un fallo espectacular de los cerebros de la econom a
7192328 hab a una fiesta y el regulador que ten a el mismo pensamiento que los que participaban en ella no quiso convertirse en un aguafiestas
7192329 si bien a n no sabemos si estamos ante una recesi n global debemos prepararnos porque en los pr ximos a os el crecimiento ser mucho m s d bil
7192330 porque en su conjunto el crecimiento econ mico no ir muy bien
7192331 sometimes the place you think would be the most inclusive is not
7192332 were blessed that we found a place that works for us
7192333 has done things in the church that i never thought hed be able to do
7192334 hes been an acolyte even though weve been scared hes going to burn the church down
7192335 our church is accepting even if its new to them
7192336 you feel like you get that look that youre the bad parent
7192337 because people will think a good parent can control their kid
7192338 they dont know how to act they just want to avoid it oftentimes
7192339 the biggest thing we try to foster is openness and engagement regardless of where a family comes from
7192340 ramsey is going through a lot of growing pains our nephew and daughters had growing pains and we helped them get through it
7192341 if were going to do it were going to do it together
7192342 i think they work very hard to make being married to each other a non issue
7192343 mary ann is perfectly capable of disagreeing with me and does it on a regular basis
7192344 its not against the law but to me it seems to be a little bit ridiculous
7192345 minnesota state fair an illustrated history kathryn and linda koutsky unearthed historical photographic evidence of a much busier fair a place where you can certainly imagine that salesmen of household wares implement dealers automobile manufacturers proselytizers and con artists of all stripes set up shop for an intense 10 days of business
7192346 minnesota vacation days an illustrated history as you page through that one you remember the fish you didnt catch at the lake outside brainerd where you never stayed but it all looks familiar even the 1954 ford country squire station wagon parked outside the cottage
7192347 he did his thing today he definitely made a difference being in that middle he was all in the backfield all around making plays
7192348 hes going to be something to watch in the season
7192349 if theyre not rooting for the home team what are they doing here i expected it
7192350 i just look to have that performance anytime i play
7192351 its not about me and the lions its about the browns versus the lions
7192352 i didnt notice him showing up so much as i notice him in practice
7192353 la cuesti n es que si antes de un libro se editaban 5 000 ejemplares ahora s lo se tiran 2 000 o 3 000 y se venden de 800 a 1 200 y las novelas de las que se editaban 25 000 t tulos tambi n han subido porque este tipo de libro va a las grandes superficies y all se pide un formato con empaque tapa dura colores brillantes m s caro que el sencillo de hace 15 a os
7192354 en la parte alta de la pir mide hay una cantidad de lectores intensivos similar a otros pa ses pero en la media baja hay pocos lectores de pocos libros al a o la pir mide es un l piz hay muchos menos lectores en la parte media y baja que en italia o francia as que has de hacer funcionar el mercado con tiradas muy bajas y en compensaci n publicas muchos t tulos y aguantas muchas devoluciones
7192355 ha aparecido un art culo de alarma en francia porque en el segundo semestre del 2007 las devoluciones llegaron al 22 aqu son del 45 el art culo advert a que el mercado franc s se est espa olizando
7192356 dos saltos muy grandes en los precios el del iva que en vez de descontarlo se lo a adieron el 4 y el del euro no tan espectacular como el del iva
7192357 lo que s han ido es subiendo cada a o por encima del ipc y pienso que est n caros se van a 20 euros y pico hace 20 a os los libros estaban m s baratos los libros en espa a est n m s caros que en francia italia el bolsillo en francia es muy barato y en cambio aqu hay bolsillos que pasan de los 10 euros
7192358 el lector espa ol es m s exigente en la calidad del libro buen papel tapa dura
7192359 que con los armatostes de tapa dura que se publican los precios de esos libros suban
7192360 los libros est n baratos para quien tenga deseo de leer para quien no aunque estuvieran a un euro ser an caros

7192377 we will do whatever is possible to bring the car to the u s that i promise
7192378 the regulations might not be perfect but they are a sea change compared to the situation before we hope that they will continue
7192379 the host government has not lived up to its olympic promise that the media will be completely free to report on all aspects of china
7192380 as we feared the beijing olympic games have been a period conducive to arrests convictions censorship surveillance and harassment of more than 100 journalists bloggers and dissidents
7192381 its something that i think we should talk about and explore
7192382 there are some obvious pros and cons and its certainly not beyond the exploratory stage for now but with the 12 game regular season policy there is some additional room for flexible in conference scheduling
7192383 i tend to favor this idea but im not wedded to it by any means
7192384 theres a lot of information we need to gather from several parties including the conference coaches of course

7192416 my rebellion brought me all the way to rhode island it wasnt much of a rebellion

7192418 the challenged statutes give constitutionally adequate notice of the conduct prohibited and sufficiently determinate guidelines for law enforcement
7192419 this general motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days
7192420 the viaduct remains closed and the exclusion zone remains in place as planned to allow safety checks to continue
7192421 we need to get the m1 opened as soon as possible
7192422 we have a bank holiday where people will be moving around the country coming back home going to see relatives or going to see places
7192423 they would require a very very significant investment and fundamentally speaking we are an energy company and our job is to keep peoples lights on
7192424 this demolition is a unique situation and as far as we are aware nowhere else in the world has anyone sought to bring down similar structures that sit so close to a major highway viaduct
7192425 we will carry out a series of checks to ensure that there has been no damage to the viaduct which in itself may take several hours
7192426 we will reopen the road only when we are entirely satisfied that it is safe to do so
7192427 you see very few cooling towers that are in quite such a visible position theyre 12 metres from the m1 and they kind of symbolise not only a gateway to sheffield and yorkshire but they also symbolise a gateway to the north
7192428 anybody who was worried doesnt need to be worried about this film i cannot talk about it was in very capable hands the director did a phenomenal job the director and his crew top notch cast and the guy that plays the lead is an instant star that dude is going to be so famous he is so wonderful he picked up a role that i would say is pretty challenging for someone to step into the shoes of because it is a role that has been played before many times by the same guy
7192429 when i get done with this they can put me on my f pension
7192430 how many of the prophets fought in allahs way and with them fought large bands of godly men but they never lost heart if they met with disaster in allahs way nor did they weaken in will nor give in and allah loves those who are firm and steadfast
7192431 whenever allah wills good for a person he subjects him to adversity
7192432 and remember that abraham was tried by his lord with certain commands which he fulfilled he said
7192433 but my promise is not within the reach of evil doers
7192434 we know indeed the grief which their words do cause thee it is not thee they reject it is the signs of allah which the wicked condemn rejected were the apostles before thee with patience and constancy they bore their rejection and their wrongs until our aid did reach them there is none that can alter the words and decrees of allah already hast thou received some account of those apostles if their spurning is hard on thy mind yet if thou wert able to seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the skies and bring them a sign what good if it were allahs will he could gather them together unto true guidance so be not thou amongst those who are swayed by ignorance and impatience
7192435 before thee we sent apostles to many nations and we afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity that they might learn humility
7192436 whenever we sent a prophet to a town we took up its people in suffering and adversity in order that they might learn humility
7192437 allah will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now until he separates what is evil from what is good nor will he disclose to you the secrets of the unseen but he chooses of his messenger for the purpose whom he pleases so believe in allah and his apostles and if ye believe and do right ye have a reward without measure
7192438 or do ye think that ye shall enter the garden of bliss without such trials as came to those who passed away before you they encountered suffering and adversity and were so shaken in spirit that even the messenger and those of faith who were with him cried
7192439 or think ye that ye shall be abandoned as though allah did not know those among you who strive with might and main and take none for friends and protectors except allah his messenger and the community of believers but allah is well acquainted with all that ye do
7192440 do men think that they will be left alone on saying
7192441 hast thou not turned thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands from fight but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity
7192442 our lord why hast thou ordered us to fight wouldst thou not grant us respite to our natural term near enough
7192443 short is the enjoyment of this world the hereafter is the best for those who do right never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least
7192444 and their lord hath accepted of them and answered them
7192445 the believing man or woman continues to have affliction in person property and children so that they may finally meet allah free from sin
7192446 no calamity befalls a muslim but that allah expiates some of his sins because of it even though it were the prick he receives from a thorn
7192447 the prophets then those who come next to them then those who come next to them a man is afflicted in keeping his religion if he is firm in his religion his trial is severe but if there is weakness in his religion it is made light for him and it continues like that till he walks on the earth having no sin
7192448 if the people of the towns had but believed and feared allah we should indeed have opened out to them all kinds of blessings from heaven and earth but they rejected the truth and we brought them to book for their misdeeds
7192449 but when they forgot the warning they had received we opened to them the gates of all good things until in the midst of their enjoyment of our gifts on a sudden we called them to account when lo they were plunged in despair
7192450 verily the greatness of reward is proportionate to the greatness of the test and indeed if allah loves a people he tests them whoever is pleased upon him is allahs pleasure and whoever is angry upon him is allahs wrath
7192451 if allah wants to do good to somebody he afflicts him with trials
7192452 the example of a believer is that of a fresh tender plant from whatever direction the wind comes it bends it but when the wind becomes quiet it becomes straight again similarly a believer is afflicted with calamities but he remains patient till allah removes his difficulties and an impious wicked person is like a pine tree which keeps hard and straight till allah cuts breaks it down when he wishes
7192453 the challenged statutes give constitutionally adequate notice of the conduct prohibited and sufficiently determinate guidelines for law enforcement
7192454 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
7192455 the electronic systems which guarantee our safety aboard the ss free gaza and ss liberty have been jammed and scrambled
7192456 what happens when you get what you want the growing blogosphere angst
7192457 i just look at each one as an individual case
7192458 people have blogs that become very popular maybe blogging is just the activity of posting content to the web some blogs are journalism and some arent
7192459 gnomedex founder chris pirillo is good at keeping an audience why because he writes good stuff either you write good stuff or you write crap bottom line
7192460 i consider my blog a loss leader for my other businesses
7192461 i do all of those things but ultimately my blog is the heart of it
7192462 from the beginning of my blog in 2004 i decided its not about driving traffic its about driving influence
7192463 from the beginning i said i wasnt going to overblog i was only going to blog when i had something to say
7192464 is that the audience is starting to follow me its really about people wanting to hear what i have to say

7192471 theyre drinking the kool aid that somehow i have changed positions on the issues all i can say is that we all grow we all grow wiser and we all refine our positions
7192472 made a very passionate case that we need to look at adding more troops
7192473 in november 2003 secretary rumsfeld and senator mccain had one of a number of conversations that ended with the two in agreement on the need to win in iraq
7192474 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7192475 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7192476 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7192477 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7192478 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7192479 one of the nicest places in the world to live in
7192480 no i didnt no no sometimes im given to a little hyperbole
7192481 john mccain told reporters today aug 13 that he does not want the hostile attacks of russia on its neighboring country georgia to be politicized in this campaign despite the fact that his members of his campaign have been doing so this week
7192482 this isnt a time for partisanship and sniping between campaigns this is about hundreds if not thousands of innocent people whose lives are being taken or they are being rendered homeless wounded this is not time for that to start with
7192483 i think the first major speech mccain gave expressing concerns about russian policies in former warsaw pact or former soviet pact was in 1993 i dont know when the first statement senator obama might have given about russia when he started issuing statements on russia so theres a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that doesnt compare between the two on russian policy
7192484 you cant compare a 15 year historical record with three or four statements over the course of fifteen months
7192485 if you read the statements from the beginning senator mccain and senator obama one had kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience the other senator mccain was strong and clear and principled and put america where america always wants to be
7192486 well let me respond by by just saying that i think that whatever we think at the moment that we can all reserve that for a future time and i think judgments will be made about how we handled that situation how we approached the situation in iraq and how much experience and knowledge and background means in selecting the american peoples decision as to who should be the next commander in chief and so all i can say is there will be plenty of time for that
7192487 would do everything i can to make the bush tax cuts permanent
7192488 the choice in this election is stark and simple senator obama will raise your taxes i wont
7192489 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase
7192490 the picture i will lay out for you today is not a pretty one and its getting worse with the passage of time continuing on
7192491 yesterday he obama suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
7192492 we can do that decrease our dependence as a nation
7192493 they say you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he
7192494 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
7192495 back in 1964 when he screwed up a final jeopardy question about heathcliff from the novel
7192496 i think were doing fine i think well do fine the second phase if i could just make one very quickly
7192497 the choice in this election is stark amp simple senator obama will raise your taxes i wont
7192498 is sic payroll tax increases on the table as well
7192499 theres nothing thats off the table i have my positions and i will articulate them but nothing is off the table
7192500 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7192501 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7192502 chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general david petraeus
7192503 i believe that when he obama said that we had to leave iraq and we had to be out by last march and we had to have a date certain that was in contravention to and still is the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general david petraeus
7192504 sort of falls into the dirty tricks that i think ronald reagan would have found reprehensible
7192505 im glad that he is for the first time asking for a sit down briefing with gen petraeus and ill be very interested in what his position on iraq is when he returns
7192506 the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
7192507 which senator obama has always stipulated in his plan for withdrawal
7192508 i would rather speak at a rally or a political gathering any place outside of the country after i am president of the united states
7192509 but thats a judgment that sen obama and the american people will make
7192510 mccain himself gave a speech in canada to the economic club of canada in which he applauded naftas successes an implicit message behind that speech was that obama had been critical of the trade accord
7192511 couric question 3 senator mccain sen obama says while the increased number of u s troops contributed to increased security in iraq he also credits the sunni awakening and the shiite government going after militias and says that there might have been improved security even without the surge whats your response to that
7192512 i dont know how you respond to something that is such a false depiction of what actually happened colonel mcfarlane phonetic was contacted by one of the major sunni sheiks because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others
7192513 i dont think there is any plot i hope there isnt
7192514 but its an amazing phenomenon ill tell you that its like the flap over the foreign leader deal a guy gets up and quizzes me its my fault for trying to answer but john mccain says something about the ambassador to czechoslovakia well i know there is no czechoslovakia theres a czech republic and a slovakia but yet it didnt make the nightly national news im not going to gripe about it but the media question is starting to pop up
7192515 a couple of steps that the russian government took in the last several day
7192516 weve learned that exports to iran increased by tenfold during the bush administration the biggest export was cigarettes given that the yeah supposedly that the
7192517 maybe thats the way of killing them chuckles i meant that as a joke
7192518 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7192519 they need the education and training particularly since more and more women are heads of their households as much or more than anybody else
7192520 and its hard for them to leave their families when they dont have somebody to take care of them
7192521 more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex
7192522 this is the same organization that i voted to condemn as a terrorist organization when an amendment was on the floor of the united states senate senator obama refused to vote
7192523 once my condition had stabilized my interrogators resumed their work demands for military information were accompanied by threats to terminate my medical treatment if i did not cooperate eventually i gave them my ships name and squadron number and confirmed that my target had been the power plant pressed for more useful information i gave the names of the green bay packers offensive line and said they were members of my squadron when asked to identify future targets i simply recited the names of a number of north vietnamese cities that had already been bombed
7192524 five years ago the outdoor footware company crocs was started by a couple of entrepreneurs with a great idea ingenuity and drive this former small business now employs 600 people in colorado alone and sells over 50 of its products in 90 countries around the world building barriers to crocs or any american companys access to foreign markets will have a devastating effect on our economy and jobs and the prosperity of american families
7192525 if you want to call it his proposal to temporarily suspend the gas tax decried by most economists a gimmick fine you know the economists theyre the same ones that didnt predict this housing crisis were in
7192526 u s senator john mccains presidential campaign today released a statement signed by over 300 professional economists in support of john mccains jobs for america economic plan the list includes nobel prize winners business economists with experience in the private sector policy economists with experience in government and academic economists from major universities and state and community colleges
7192527 i dont think getting shot down is a qualification to be president
7192528 military service inherently makes somebody better equipped to be commander in chief
7192529 i n 1986 we passed a law and said we would secure the borders and gave amnesty to a couple three million people i supported that legislation way back then
7192530 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you c nt
7192531 he sen webb creates a new bureaucracy and new rules his bill offers the same benefits whether you stay three years or longer we want to have a sliding scale to increase retention
7192532 if he said that and i do not know the context i strenuously disagree
7192533 30 of the people who have already been released from guantanamo bay have already tried to attack america again one of them just a couple weeks ago a suicide bomber in iraq
7192534 i don know about you but im proud of my country
7192535 ill admit to you that its tough in some respects we have not always done things right and we mismanaged the war in iraq very badly for nearly four years
7192536 i didnt really didnt love america until i was deprived of her company
7192537 it wasnt until i was deprived of her company that i fell in love with america
7192538 should be treated with respect and if theres any disrespectful conduct on the part of anyone those people should be rejected
7192539 it is critical as we prepare to face off with whomever the democrats select as their nominee that we all follow johns lead and run a respectful campaign focused on the issues and values that are important to the american people
7192540 i intend to wage this campaign and to govern this country in a way that they would be proud of me
7192541 is it ok to unconditionally meet with anti american foreign leaders
7192542 if the plan sounds familiar thats because that was jimmy carters big idea too and a lot of good it did us
7192543 ive never been for quote privatized social security i never have been i never will be
7192544 we can also afford to spend more on national defense which currently consumes less than four cents of every dollar that our economy generates far less than what we spent during the cold war
7192545 mccain promised hed offer a balanced budget by the end of his first term
7192546 i would like the next president not to talk about deficit reduction
7192547 the media often overlooked how compassionately she spoke to the concerns and dreams of millions of americans and she deserves a lot more appreciation than she sometimes received
7192548 i did not that was in prepared remarks and i did not
7192549 most great civilized countries have an income tax and an inheritance tax
7192550 in my judgment both should be part of our system of federal taxation
7192551 i think that presidents have the obligation to obey and enforce laws that are passed by congress and signed into law by the president no matter what the situation is
7192552 so is that a no in other words federal statute trumps inherent power in that case warrantless surveillance
7192553 i dont think the president has the right to disobey any law
7192554 n either the administration nor the telecoms need apologize for actions that most people except for the aclu and the trial lawyers understand were constitutional and appropriate in the wake of the attacks on september 11 2001
7192555 its ambiguous as to whether the president acted within his authority or not
7192556 im not interested in going back im interested in addressing the challenge we face to day of trying to do everything we can to counter organizations and individuals that want to destroy this country so theres ambiguity about it lets move forward
7192557 a divestment campaign against south africa helping to rid that nation of the evil of apartheid
7192558 false hopes that somehow we can bring back lost jobs
7192559 i cant tell you that these jobs are ever coming back to this magnificent part of the country
7192560 i know thats small comfort to you but i cant look you in the eye and tell you that those steel mills are coming back
7192561 ive supported every investigation and ways of finding out what caused the tragedy ive been here to new orleans ive met with people on the ground
7192562 you will hear from my opponents campaign in every speech every interview every press release that im running for president bushs third term
7192563 while strengthening border security is an essential component of national security it
7192564 but the three examples of spending highlighted in the ad a
7192565 are neighborhoods in baghdad where you and i could walk through those neighborhoods today
7192566 100 american soldiers with three blackhawk helicopters and two apache gunships overhead
7192567 general petraeus goes out there almost every day in an
7192568 i checked with general petraeuss people overnight and they said he never goes out in anything less than an up armored humvee
7192569 its not about who they are its about who we are
7192570 would of said anything to get them to stop torturing him
7192571 gave up the names of the entire 1965 green bay packers starting line
7192572 i dont believe the wealthiest 10 of americans should get 60 of the tax breaks i think the lowest 10 should get the breaks
7192573 i am disappointed that the senate finance committee preferred instead to cut the top tax rate of 39 6 to 36 thereby granting generous tax relief to the wealthiest individuals of our country at the expense of lower and middle income american taxpayers
7192574 but when you look at the percentage of the tax cuts that as the previous tax cuts that go to the wealthiest americans you will find that the bulk of it again goes to wealthiest americans
7192575 ethanol is a product that would not exist if congress didnt create an artificial market for it no one would be willing to buy it
7192576 yet thanks to agricultural subsidies and ethanol producer subsidies it is now a very big business tens of billions of dollars that have enriched a handful of corporate interests primarily one big corporation adm
7192577 i support ethanol and i think it is a vital a vital alternative energy source not only because of our dependency on foreign oil but its greenhouse gas reduction effects
7192578 as long as its inevitable you might as well lie back and enjoy it
7192579 today for example 1 3 million people in the world make a living off ebay most of those are in the united state of america
7192580 thats a source that didnt even exist 10 years ago
7192581 four hundred thousand people make some money trading on ebay
7192582 id love to see a point where it is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
7192583 i dont think a constitutional amendment is probably going to take place but i do believe that its very likely or possible that
7192584 im a federalist just as i believe that the issue of gay marriage should be decided by the states so do i believe that we would be better off by having roe v wade return to the states and

7192615 de zondag is duidelijk onderscheiden van de sabbat waarop hij wekelijks chronologisch volgt hij komt voor de christenen in de plaats van de voorgeschreven sabbatviering de zondag brengt de geestelijke waarheid van de joodse sabbat in het pasen van christus tot vervulling en is een aankondiging van de eeuwige rust van de mens bij god want de eredienst van de wet was een voorbereiding op het christusmysterie en wat daar gebeurde was een zekere voorafbeelding met betrekking tot christus zij die leefden volgens de oude ordening der dingen zijn nu gekomen tot een nieuwe verwachting zij onderhouden niet meer de sabbat maar wel de dag des heren waarop ons leven gezegend is door hem en door zijn dood

7192887 i actually kind of like joe biden and i think i would have a great time if i were to sit down and have a beer with him
7192888 i follow politics as closely as the next guy but im pretty sure i didnt know who biden was until the democratic debates began last year

7192894 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7192895 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7192896 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7192897 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7192898 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7192899 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7192900 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7192901 were at the beginning of home information technology we are dancing naked on the stage of history
7192902 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7192903 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7192904 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7192905 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7192906 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7192907 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7192908 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7192909 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7192910 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7192911 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7192912 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7192913 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7192914 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7192915 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7192916 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7192917 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7192918 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

7192923 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7192924 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7192925 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7192926 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7192927 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7192928 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7192929 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7192930 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7192931 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7192932 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

7192936 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7192937 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7192938 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7192939 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7192940 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7192941 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7192942 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7192943 extremely happy we often find the remains of young victims

7192946 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7192947 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7192948 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7192949 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7192950 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7192951 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7192952 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7192953 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7192954 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7192955 when you consider that it doesnt include another four years of secondary education plus five more years of medical school if he wants to follow his previously stated goal to grow up to be a doctor like his daddy this will come as an interminably deep chasm of drudgery and imprisonment to connor
7192956 its difficult to know the effect on his psychological well being when he grasps the full truth that his education will be followed by approximately four decades of work bills and taxes during which he will also rear his own children to face the same fate all of which will of course be followed by a brief almost inconsequential retirement and his inevitable death
7192957 even a 50 year old adult would have trouble processing such a monstrous notion

7192968 they were looking for anything they could find to make a news story out of thin air not one idf ship was ever seen by these protesters
7192969 at the end of the day we do need to lie
7192970 if we make a mistake we will be the first to admit it while the international media sees day after day pure propaganda coming from gaza the international media has come to learn the difference between democracy and free speech at work in israel and hamas terrorism in gaza journalists have long memories and many remember wall street journal reporter daniel pearl and the recent kidnappings of journalists in gaza by hamas

7193033 hell say he doesnt want to race that way like he always does
7193034 it wasnt much of a pass to me well see what hes got to say when he gets wrecked
7193035 well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7193036 i had to ask if hed do that to me and he has before
7193037 thats the way it goes we keep talking about rivalries we might have one now too bad we tore up the car after the race i guess he wasnt happy about it
7193038 its racing we cant give up points when theyre there to take
7193039 i like my spotter he is a good guy but man thats ridiculous
7193040 we took a bunch of cars out for no reason i heard clear clear clear went up and there was still someone there i am pretty upset about it there were a lot of people that got involved in that which shouldnt have been involved at all because it shouldnt have happened
7193041 michael waltrip is the worst driver in nascar period i cant believe napa signed back on
7193042 its a shame that we got caught in that mess we had a really good car
7193043 thats the risk you run at bristol i love racing here its a great place with great fans its just a bad race for us
7193044 some guys got together in front of me and the guy behind me didnt get checked up and drilled me you need to look past your hood you look in front you tend not to hit stuff i was trying to be smart and really cautious and it didnt do me any good i got wrecked anyway
7193045 its a typical bristol wreck wrong place wrong time but im happy with the way the car ran
7193046 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7193047 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7193048 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7193049 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7193050 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7193051 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7193052 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7193053 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7193054 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7193055 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7193056 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7193057 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7193058 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7193059 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7193060 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7193061 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7193062 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7193099 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7193100 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7193101 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7193102 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7193103 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7193104 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7193105 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7193106 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7193107 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7193108 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7193109 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7193110 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7193111 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7193112 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7193113 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7193114 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7193115 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7193116 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7193117 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7193118 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7193119 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7193120 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7193121 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7193122 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7193123 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7193124 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7193125 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7193126 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7193127 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7193128 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7193129 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7193130 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7193131 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7193132 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7193133 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7193134 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7193135 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7193136 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7193137 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7193138 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7193139 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7193140 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7193141 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7193142 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7193143 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7193144 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7193145 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7193146 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7193147 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7193148 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7193149 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7193150 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7193151 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7193152 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7193153 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7193154 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7193155 el m s fr o de los ltimo 5 como m nimo
7193156 con un alto grado de probabilidad que este a o ser el m s fr o de al menos los ltimos 5
7193157 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7193158 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7193159 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7193160 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7193161 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7193162 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7193163 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7193164 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7193165 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7193166 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7193167 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7193168 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7193169 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7193170 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7193171 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7193172 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7193173 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7193174 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7193175 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7193176 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7193177 forget tom daschles blog the south dakota politics blog is where you want to go if youre interested in well south dakota politics and hey who isnt
7193178 bloggers like south dakota politics have done a great job of exposing the incredibly biased reporting of the states dominant newspaper the sioux falls argus leader
7193179 first the nyt now the sioux falls argus leader bloggers subject their state paper to close scrutiny
7193180 the influence of blogging on politics is nowhere more obvious than in south dakota
7193181 a credible counterweight to local south dakota papers such as the sioux falls argus leader which too often falls into the habit of ignoring new angles to the race and uncritically running mr daschles press releases
7193182 aunque nunca he sido huesuda s que recuerdo haber pensado no quiero estar tan delgada
7193183 como se vino haciendo desde la fundaci n en 1982
7193184 que no resultar a cre ble si al tiempo se hurta la capacidad de decidir de la militancia
7193185 ha habido un shock que ha hecho que la informaci n fuera demasiado lenta y eso abre las puertas a especulaciones que en muchas ocasiones son tambi n irresponsables
7193186 que se subsane lo que al principio fue una oscuridad informativa que ha sido muy notable y muy destacada exigi la informaci n oficial de las primeras horas brillaba por su ausencia y eso hizo saltar las alarmas
7193187 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7193188 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7193189 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7193190 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7193191 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7193192 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7193193 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7193194 i was losing blood i thought i was going to pass out i expected someone to answer the phone when i called 911
7193195 i dont know if they need more lines or operators but they need to revisit our current system
7193196 there are just moments in time when the volume of calls overwhelms us
7193197 but who wants on their tombstone i was one of the 10 percent
7193198 with a wreck on the highway everyone sees it everyone calls and thats where we get backed up
7193199 i couldnt believe i had an emergency and they basically put me on hold
7193200 i might have stayed on hold maybe not even a minute
7193201 but with a crime in progress it just seemed kind of weird thank god nobody was getting hurt
7193202 nobody has sufficient staff to get to 20 or 30 simultaneous calls
7193203 it doesnt take more than one 911 call to back the process up
7193204 but there could be someone sitting in a queue whose mommas house is burning down
7193205 as long as there is somebody to answer the phone they officials are ok with it
7193206 for anyone six minutes may seem like forever because when
7193207 i think it will raise his profile because the optimistic message is so similar in the way the campaigns have been run
7193208 in devals case he is certainly perceived by the national media as someone who has a voice similar to barack obamas voice
7193209 what he says to the convention the things he chooses to talk about are going to be perceived to be precursors to where obama intends to run this campaign what their issues are
7193210 the governor is honored to play a part in this important convention
7193211 he sees this convention and the outcome of the election as being critically important to massachusetts as we try to chart a new direction for our country
7193212 its a speech that political junkies will watch and not many other people but it is a recognition of his standing in the party
7193213 its unlikely he would go for anything less than a cabinet position and there are a pretty limited number of those it would not be a rebuke to patrick in any way if hes not offered a cabinet position its not like his career is riding on this hes only been governor for two years it would seem to be an incomplete governorship if he left in january
7193214 on the economy which is on the minds of so many voters mitt romney is the guy
7193215 hes run a state as an executive hes run the olympics during some extremely challenging financial times and hes been successful in business
7193216 even if he is not the vice president i still think hes got a place in the administration if he wants it
7193217 john mccain is certainly well known and has a history of trying to end wasteful government
7193218 barack obama is untested right now youre looking at the mood shift
7193219 they dont know much about him they think they know mccain
7193220 the economy may be one of his mccains weaker points but i feel that he has the experience he knows more readily what would help families
7193221 senator mccain looks like a traditional president an older white guy
7193222 the election isnt a regional election its a state by state election mccains improvement is really republicans coming home
7193223 the economy far outweighs any other issue in this election
7193224 he has to really push that issue its the same way bill clinton won in 92
7193225 i wanted to create my own architecture and not depend on the museum space
7193226 she knew early on that i had virtually not much in common with the rockefeller family
7193227 referred to me as having been descended from john d rockefeller and such whenever it was to her advantage
7193228 she usually did so in an understated way calling special attention to it by keeping it extra quiet
7193229 sort of psst shes married to a rockefeller its like saying you went to harvard it opens doors
7193230 from what ive heard lately it might not be but as far as i know its my name
7193231 perhaps at some point we can do a dna test to really find out
7193232 gerhartsreiter is at the center of the longest con ive seen in my professional career
7193233 i think school is fun but if i had to pick id take summer
7193234 dad can we go back and fish on the pier
7193235 we were basically living at childrens hospital for a year and a half
7193236 you dream about the day when you have a son and can share all the things you like to do with them
7193237 then you get a curveball and wonder if it will ever happen its great that we can get out like this now
7193238 itll be me first then kevin and paul then me kevin paul he says
7193239 thats why youre here today you know its not about no one person its not about south delta its not about you its about all of the delta community
7193240 i dont think thats fair really because i keep my property up she keeps her property up but the people down the street dont keep their property up thats not my responsibility
7193241 you have to make a decision on how and what way you want your community
7193242 if paper and stuff is being put in my community i go down the street and i clean up
7193243 you would think that in 2008 people have learned the lessons of mississippis horrid past
7193244 the letter is direct and not subtle in its attack on the very core of the goals and mandate of sdrha to provide affordable and first class housing for the clients that it serves
7193245 it is not a mandate that perpetuates the age old stereotypes those less fortunate should be constricted to marginal housing
7193246 she just barreled right through she didnt let anyone get a word in edgewise
7193247 we didnt have any idea that there was a problem
7193248 just because a person makes less than somebody else doesnt mean theyre worth less
7193249 you cant judge a person based on whether theyre poor or rich
7193250 they forgot about those grants they mentioned last time everybody was supposed to get a grant to fix their houses up
7193251 i dont appreciate them talking to me no kind of way
7193252 we hold the mortgage to this property and you gotta keep it up simple as that
7193253 if we dont do this make sure they take care of their property then people like hebe splane is gonna win
7193254 people jack up the price if they know youve got federal money
7193255 they did yard work poured concrete put in air conditioners painted it inside they even done the flower beds
7193256 id see them when id leave in the morning and when id come back in the evening theyd still be there
7193257 and when i came home for my lunch hour they were there then too
7193258 but were not gonna stop because of how they feel
7193259 i wont be able to sleep sunday night just imagining what my kids will be like
7193260 i will be up at 5 a m monday wired excited ready and fearful all at once
7193261 its not just going to be about the students but also about the parents
7193262 these are their babies and they are leaving them in my care and i am going to have to possess confidence and ensure trust
7193263 i remember playing teacher when i was a little girl
7193264 when i graduated high school i married and started a family but i knew i wanted to do this
7193265 you have to buy things organize things and change things to capture the students attention you have to make it fun
7193266 he was a man who was consumed by what he was doing as many scientists are
7193267 you had this feeling of remoteness and quietness but it wasnt so remote that you felt uneasy and at the same time it had a certain amount of vigor
7193268 then we would drive home listening to the steelers game and then in the evening wed play bridge we had about 50 years of that
7193269 he got great slabs of stone he was scientific about it you see that made my oven racks bend and he put in water
7193270 he was trying to imitate the quality of french bread not just the quality of it but the flavor of it the texture of it
7193271 john maine told the post after tonights loss to the astros that he expects to have arthroscopic surgery after the season to remove a painful bone spur in his right shoulder
7193272 maine as you know has been told he cant sustain further structural damage by continuing to pitch
7193273 its ridiculous how fast can you go before the world record cant be broke how fast can the human
7193274 to bel air someone is to tell them a shaggy dog story supposedly relating to a serious matter and
7193275 qu son los crestianos las arrugas infinitas de su csa se reconfiguraron en un gesto grotesco que prented a representar sorpresa de d nde eres me pregunt de la dec polis de filadelfia y no tienen crestianos por ah yo creo que no se alz de hombros pues ya tendr n son una plaga de haber sabido nada mas hubi ramos degollado en los calabozos al pobrecito rab nazareno qu rab nazareno tampoco has o do hablar de l se ri estert reamente y dijo representando pompa rab yesu nazaretitas el cresto rey de los jud os e hijo de yav y se volvi a re r
7193276 it was the worst start of a tournament ever because we were all so close to them
7193277 but everyone knew the way we could have made them happy it was to go out and play the best way we could possibly play
7193278 and that we came as far as we did i hope people watched at home i hope they saw how this is a true team i hope girls back home saw it this is not just any other game its a world thing you know were here to inspire young kids we never stopped fighting
7193279 were in touch with her by e mail joines said
7193280 we read hers and she reads ours she says it brings a smile to her face when she does
7193281 i play better i just kind of go on my emotions
7193282 the usa team is the best weve seen in the last four years
7193283 but weve got to think about what we really did we accomplished a lot
7193284 we import the stories of the top news websites and blogs for any given topic and display the headlines of the five most recent stories
7193285 what i am seeing is a miracle this is real magic
7193286 ive made contingency plans anyway if its a hair lengths difference ill release 300 people from the jail seriously though it looks like we will break the world record
7193287 this 1 mile walk by roy is one of the most awesome occasions in vegas history they are iconic nobody can ever detract from their greatness and the fact that theyve come back this far when people had written poor roy off is a miracle and this is the season of miracles isnt it
7193288 roy really wanted to do this for an entire year last year he just couldnt attend the st one so he made a promise to do it this year for the 2nd one and he kept the promise i forgot all about it to be honest but a week ago he said it was time i actually tried to discourage him because this is not an easy task but he insisted hed promised and it was his goal to do it and he did it now its a real miracle for me the entire year the three years has been a miracle you know i am an illusionist magic has been my entire life but with this now i feel and see real magic everyday
7193289 no because only haley can do an underdoggy on these swings
7193290 and the song has a nice funky bassline and a bit of calypso as well
7193291 i didnt like soul man it didnt make any sense to me
7193292 one of the lyrics said i was educated at woodstock what does that mean there wasnt a school at woodstock
7193293 it was written following segregation we were black men we were soul men it took me many years to understand that
7193294 everybody was always pushing the gangs out but we included them
7193295 they liked the power of working security but didnt like being around gay people they did it anyway
7193296 people want to think all these problems have gone away but it hasnt
7193297 we try to fool ourselves into thinking it doesnt exist being gay is still the worst thing you can be in this country hopefully we are making an impact
7193298 i will always be appreciative to the man who put sam amp dave on the map
7193299 i do this concert for the memory of the bald headed one but im sorry im doing it this way
7193300 deus me livre dos meus amigos porque dos meus inimigos cuido eu
7193301 se voc quiser algu m em quem confiar confie em si mesmo quem acredita sempre alcan a

7193303 nada seria o que porque tudo seria o que n o e ao contr rio o que n o seria e o que n o seria seria voc entendeu
7193304 gas and fuel prices are definitely the most important issues in the election
7193305 people are going to have to make a choice on whether they pay for gas or for food if people cant get to work because of gas prices what difference does any other issue make
7193306 but we also need to be looking at increasing vehicle fuel efficiency standards
7193307 itll have an impact but after well be right back in the same boat as before
7193308 we need to drill and drill now to send a strong signal that were ending our dependency on foreign oil
7193309 were going to need 50 percent more power in the next 20 years and nuclear power is the only way were going to reach that goal
7193310 the people who create the jobs are taking them out of state because of high energy costs
7193311 other states are more predatory when it comes to growing their job bases
7193312 if you take a look around theres not much available in connecticut when it comes to entry level jobs and that should be the no 1 focus of our economic plan how to create high value jobs
7193313 theres no difference between a person thats lived here for years illegally and others just entering illegally now
7193314 i dont envision a sort of round em up policy but we need to enforce the law
7193315 while there has been progress in iraq were going backwards in afghanistan which is a far greater threat
7193316 were seeing an inability to move troops in afghanistan because of the surge in iraq
7193317 we made that mess in iraq but we didnt make the one in afghanistan
7193318 i feel no obligation to run this problem down to zero we should pull out put ships on the coast and strike at the camps as needed
7193319 we probably started planning back in june weve got hot dogs hamburgers baked beans and toasted marshmallows
7193320 ive been swimming and walking around and talking to people and finding people to play with
7193321 we folded up some t shirts wet them and froze them
7193322 the children have to try and unfold them and put the shirts on
7193323 i ripped it open to unfold it ripped the sleeves out of the folds ripped open the bottom and put it on
7193324 defensively we were inconsistent and couldnt stop them when we needed to
7193325 were fooling ourselves if we think we can just turn it on when the season starts
7193326 i didnt throw it as well as i would have liked today and we didnt execute as well as we would have liked
7193327 im never one to throw bouquets at guys when we lose the game
7193328 he did what he was supposed to do evidently we didnt do enough of what were supposed to do to win
7193329 he saw the classic nfl approach to a young quarterback
7193330 pressure him and see if he can handle it if he cant handle it keep pressuring him
7193331 at times he did the right thing and people he was throwing to were not on the same page as him
7193332 but i think if maybe we had an extra day or more opportunities for me to work with the ones i think we would have done a better job of getting on the same page
7193333 we need a scientific acumen to solve these complex problems
7193334 but ive also inhaled welders fumes when i worked in a shipfitter yard so id fight for green energy use at the sub base general dynamics and at dow chemical
7193335 im an old athlete and ive prevailed many times as an underdog
7193336 in terms of change idealism and knowledge im the front runner
7193337 giving congress the sole ability to print money not the federal reserve would solve a lot of our problems including inflation overnight
7193338 the debt based system were under now debases the dollar and is one of the reasons fuel prices are so high

7193342 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7193343 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7193344 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7193345 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7193346 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7193347 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7193348 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7193349 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7193350 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7193351 im always challenging myself and seeing what i can do
7193352 but im a good athlete my stamina i can get that up there if i really try
7193353 i like getting a lot of time with the babies
7193354 its very difficult to be a career person and have a relationship
7193355 i think you have to figure out some way of keeping all of those capabilities and requirements in your life in balance
7193356 emotionally i felt real good doing it for my mom once it was over and i saw my mom i felt a sense of closeness a sense of fulfillment
7193357 i know this will change my life now i will be able to pick up and go
7193358 im just glad its behind us and we can look forward to our life and be healthy
7193359 jamie wanted justin to help britney for a time justin seriously considered doing a couple of concerts with her to help her out
7193360 ive written a song for my next lp about them called my baby its a beautiful song im really proud of it
7193361 they have done some of the things that they promised that theyd do but we still have concerns
7193362 weve explained to them that we have to get the right bid but at the end of six months theyll have two very very reliable elevators
7193363 even though we are in a technological age reading and libraries are indispensable
7193364 the media center should be involved if were going to be talking about adequate yearly progress in the instructional program
7193365 the gap has definitely been bridged between the media center and the classrooms we are definitely one entity
7193366 kids come to us with the background of technology and that relieves us as media specialists
7193367 most of them have a very good background in technology
7193368 if you put new technology in a classroom with teachers and dont show them how to use it theyre not going to use it
7193369 because were so short staffed we have to ask some of the media specialists to do some of the troubleshooting for us
7193370 she wants cydney and cynthia to be friends jodie realises that if cydney perceives them to be one big happy family shed never sue for half her assets
7193371 i bought 1 000 tickets to the show i still have them
7193372 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7193373 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7193374 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7193375 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7193376 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7193377 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7193378 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7193379 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7193380 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7193381 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7193382 this is a planning took where all things are going
7193383 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7193384 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7193385 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7193386 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7193387 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7193388 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7193389 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7193390 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7193391 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7193392 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7193393 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7193394 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7193395 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7193396 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7193397 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7193398 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7193399 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7193400 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7193401 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

7193405 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7193406 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7193407 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7193408 let the blind led those who can see but cannot feel
7193409 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7193410 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7193411 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7193412 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7193413 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7193414 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7193415 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7193416 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7193417 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7193418 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7193419 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7193420 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7193421 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7193422 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7193423 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7193424 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7193425 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7193426 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7193427 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7193428 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7193429 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7193430 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7193431 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

7193434 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7193435 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7193436 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7193437 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7193438 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7193439 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7193440 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7193441 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7193442 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7193443 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7193444 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7193445 im really a chill person i dont party much bla bla
7193446 hes playing good defense hitting great even when we were struggling he kept going like the energizer bunny
7193447 i think it was easy for me to come back to the american league
7193448 it was very difficult for me last year going to the national league new parks new cities new pitchers this year im coming back to the american league to a team in the american league west in a stadium where id played 10 times a year
7193449 i love hitting here its a great stadium great lighting great atmosphere but if i had to face angels pitching here 81 times those stats would be a little different
7193450 teixeira is just absolutely killing everything we throw hes on every ball
7193451 you look at the stats and they say vlad hits into some double plays so you have to take a chance thats pick your poison with his twins starter nick blackburns sinker out there on the mound youre going to try to get a ground ball and see what happens
7193452 we kind of donated a few too many runs early
7193453 thats supposed to be a sac fly by guerrero he gomez just missed the ball he just misplayed it i know they gave him a hit but thats an out its their ballpark so thats fine but thats supposed to be an out we catch that ball most guys do
7193454 i knew in the bullpen warming up i didnt feel good today
7193455 i was fighting to get over the top of the ball fighting to keep it down in the zone
7193456 just holding the ball in my hand didnt feel really good im not going to make any excuses ive got to go out there and keep my team in the game when youre making 30 some starts a year youre not going to feel 100 percent every time no one does
7193457 darren seems like the second half of this year is a lot like the second half of last year hes really come into his own and thrown the ball well for us
7193458 we can use darren in the middle like we did tonight or we can use him late hes not just a situational lefty
7193459 that bridge he provided to give us a game we could save with shieldsy and frankie was big
7193460 i think it was a well needed meeting sosh did it at the right time
7193461 that meeting kind of pumped us up a bit it wasnt screaming it was just telling us the truth
7193462 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7193463 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7193464 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7193465 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7193466 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7193467 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7193468 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7193469 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7193470 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7193471 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

7193496 the two new cyber shot phones that we have announced today share certain characteristics both phones place ease of use and best in class picture quality at the heart of their designs
7193497 yet both appeal to different audiences one is engineered to let you take more pictures in more places and the other is designed to look as stunning as the pictures it takes

7193889 rainsy sees the devil in the details of necs rules
7193890 the national election committee nec has initiated changes in the voter registration process that could have far reaching consequences the nec is creating unnecessary and untimely work and procedures for people most of whom are unable to do it the necs initiative could practically end up depriving millions of citizens of their voting rights the victims will be mainly non cpp members because all cpp members are identified as such by their village chiefs and will receive in time related information assistance and facilities to do the work imposed by the nec most of those who do not support the ruling cpp will be left in the dark many international observers do not realize that the results of the 2007 and 2007 elections are largely being decided now through a biased registration process
7193891 the national election committees changes to the voter registration process are deciding the outcomes of the 2007 commune and 2008 national elections before they have had a chance to take place many international observers do not realize that the results of the 2007 and 2008 elections are largely being decided now through the registration process
7193892 if hes available well play him but i cant say hes available ive got no idea
7193893 hes one of our best players and knowing what he knows and who hes going to draw well weigh it up
7193894 were not going to expose players who arent right but if its an anthony rocca whos coming off a long term injury and hes available to play well then thats one of the things youd be pretty silly not to do

7193898 this year has been a nightmare but i guess if you put it in with all the great times ive had then its not so bad
7193899 but this year has been extremely frustrating and disappointing its nobodys fault its just one of those things that happens in sport all the time
7193900 i thought jamal idris made a terrific debut he showed hes a good first grader of the future
7193901 his first 20 minutes was fantastic the pace of it caught up with him a little bit i think and he started cramping 15 to 20 minutes into the second half
7193902 but he certainly showed his strength and his speed and he can certainly jump and catch the ball
7193903 whether he stays there in first grade or not its hard to say but certainly on that performance you would think he would be there next week
7193904 he played well i thought he handled the step up pretty good and he was a handful
7193905 i thought they played particularly well probably the best theyve played for a long time

7193915 of course theres no universal answer to the vista upgrade question yes in all likelihood youll be just fine sticking with windows xp at least until windows 7 ships in 2009 or 2010 but lets not rush to universal judgment lets take a close measured look at the key considerations and compare vistas merits against the state of xp on the essential points that it organizations and end users care about and if we cant solve this calmly and objectively like fair minded professionals then lets at least have a good fight

7193961 if there is in principle support from the australia government we would form working groups to look at how many people and where
7193962 i believe the prime minister would be very keen to see some east timorese workers come and assist us with the mango harvest
7193963 getting people to work getting people an education getting skills is the best defence against a further uprising in timor leste
7193964 we need to find ways where we can have a win for east timor provide some support there as well as fill a need here

7193966 t bone collisions side collisions are more likely to be fatal than front or rear end accidents of similar force this is because the side of the vehicle is usually far less protected than the front or rear and there is less protecting the people inside although side air bags can help they offer little help in a serious broadside crash this type of crash is usually caused by one car not yielding the right of way resulting in a bad crash

7193970 i left the sport without any intention of returning id fallen out of love with diving
7193971 i was emotionally and physically burnt out and it did take me a long time to recover mentally and physically and start to miss it so i took the better part of a year away form the sport
7193972 i had been diving for seven years thats 10 sessions a week thats 30 hours a week for 50 weeks of the year for seven years thats a very very long time to not even reach the pinnacle of the sport so i came back with the aim of going to the olympics and ultimately to win an olympic gold medal
7193973 i wouldnt be here if i hadnt taken that time off
7193974 i know it for sure because i came back with such a drive such a burning desire and such fierce competitive spirit and i worked so hard and its a little bit emotional because i know that everything i did all the sacrifices i made how hard i had to work its all paid off its all been worth it
7193975 i often score more than 100 points on that dive its one of my most consistent dives and it is the highest degree of difficulty dive that anyone does on platform
7193976 i knew that i could score more than 100 points with it but i didnt know i had to score more than 108 to win but i went into it just wanting to enjoy it and have fun and do the best dive i could do and i knew that the points and the results would look after themselves
7193977 i was still waiting for the scores to make sure but it felt like a good dive and when i saw the results on the scoreboard because i was the second last diver and i was on top of the leaderboard i said yes i have a silver medal and i was so happy with that
7193978 i got out of the pool and i was very emotional because i didnt think i would do that well and then we watched the last dive and i ended up coming out on top so it was very emotional for me because i never thought it would happen to me not at this olympics anyway

7193986 solo la fede nellazione santificante di dio ci permette di sintonizzarci sulla stessa lunghezza donda dello spirito e questa fede e deve essere comune al cristiano doriente e doccidente

7193988 in ragione della sua grande responsabilit e venerabile dignit ecclesiastica ma anche per levangelica fraternit e la sintonia spirituale sperimentate
7193989 mi auguro lo dico con commozione che si avvicini presto il giorno in cui il patriarca di mosca possa abbracciare il successore di pietro
7193990 durante la visita del 2006 e in una successiva lettera il patriarca alessio ii ha espresso il suo interesse e sostegno per promuovere a milano nel 2013 un incontro dei leader cristiani che sia una comune testimonianza e un forte appello alleuropa e a tutte le confessioni circa linsopprimibile valore della libert religiosa

7194142 we have had an almost unparalleled two decade run of just blistering economic growth and weve grown very accustomed to it
7194143 now were going through an episode of cyclical correction that happens from time to time
7194144 how could we have been so stupid in all honesty we should have all realized what was happening sooner
7194145 but none of us know how to predict the turning points

7194167 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
7194168 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7194169 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy

7194184 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
7194185 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
7194186 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting

7194215 dodging the blame for lithuanian collaboration in the holocaust is shameful

7194220 why on earth wouldnt you want to use the yarn called for
7194221 in order to avoid a well publicised provocation in the middle of the sea
7194222 the copper indium gallium diselenide cigs thin film solar cell recently reached 19 9 percent efficiency in testing at the lab setting a new world record
7194223 produce electricity at a wholesale cost of 5 cents per kwh kilowatt hour
7194224 ordinarily the silicon in a solar panel spans its surface collecting light from as much area as possible but solaria slices the silicon into thin strips and spaces them apart so that they only account for about half the panels area a clear molded plastic cover collects light from the entire panel and funnels it to the strips of silicon
7194225 while we acknowledge that our estimate is only marginally better than a guess it is a more conservative estimate than current market estimates
7194226 all in fact based assessments require some basis for an overnight capital cost estimate and the shortcomings of simply asserting that capital costs could be significantly higher than 3500 kwe should be supported by some analysis
7194227 vendors will be able to extract premium prices until demand slackens
7194228 you could produce quite a bit of weapons grade material in one year enough for 10 bombs anyway while you continue to operate youre just moving the fuel through
7194229 the economics and design has to be something that fits for these countries that are coming up to nuclear for the first time
7194230 if we start sending reactors en masse to countries that cant even police them the risk of another kinshasa or worse happening could be all too high
7194231 thats why there are 60 plus designs under development around the world you solve one problem and introduce several more
7194232 such a reactor system would operate with minimal intervention and little maintenance
7194233 i dont think you could flip the switch and walk away but on the other hand you wouldnt need a very large operational or security force to maintain it
7194234 the countries could always kick out the inspectors then you have to worry about compliance
7194235 over 30 countries are actively considering embarking upon nuclear power programmes we see the trouble we are having with iran right now you could imagine having five or six irans out there
7194236 the notion of small self contained reactors where there is no advanced industrial infrastructure or expertise no regulatory infrastructure for system monitoring where emergency planning is sub optimal or non existent is really a recipe for disaster
7194237 its one of those ideas you look at and ask are these people for real
7194238 if we say to the developing world just wait 30 years and well give you the perfect solution to your energy needs they are going to say no thank you and grab whatever power sources they can
7194239 renewables are not even going to come close to meeting our current demands and wont come anywhere near where we are expected to go
7194240 we will never have a completely proliferation proof reactor just like there will never be an accident proof car
7194241 we should continue to improve the designs at least to the point where the consequences are insignificant
7194242 the early commercial use of a new or significantly improved technology
7194243 important step in the process to position ourselves to be among the first to get a licence for a new nuclear unit

7194255 we all go through these spells where youre playing well but youre not getting out of it what you want
7194256 and i feel if im just patient enough eventually it will turn
7194257 i dont have an answer for you because i feel like ive been driving the ball pretty good
7194258 i thought i hit some pretty good iron shots i felt like i made some decent putts and hit some decent chips but im also not getting the ball in the hole and not scoring
7194259 because especially if its in the rough you get to drop it and have a better chance at a decent lie
7194260 i heard it ding my club on the follow through
7194261 i didnt really feel it it didnt really look like it affected the shot
7194262 the way this point system is set up over the next four weeks every round and every shot every position matters because of the variance in points
7194263 and so it may not look good this week but if i can play a good round today and finish in the top 10 or 20 down the road if i win a tournament it will give me more of a cushion
7194264 or if i play well in the next couple of weeks it will position me better
7194265 we all go through these spells where youre playing well but youre not getting out of it what you want

7194281 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7194282 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7194283 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7194284 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7194285 all i did was fall in love with someone and care about them deeply and i put them ahead of everything and so be it
7194286 we have this pattern now of finding temples close to the water or under the water in this most recent case
7194287 these were probably made as part of a very elaborate ritual
7194288 there are stones huge columns and sculptures of priests in the caves
7194289 caves are natural portals to other realms which could have inspired the mayan myth they are related to darkness to fright and to monsters
7194290 im sure the myths came first and the caves reaffirmed the broad time and space myths of the mayans
7194291 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal
7194292 weve said from the first day that top to bottom we are a deep team
7194293 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7194294 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose
7194295 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals
7194296 with the days off we have and with also probably some call ups as of sept 1 we could do that
7194297 well rest him and keep fernando tatis swinging and have church ready for monday

7194303 when were playing the way were playing and weve got guys holding up well you go with them as far as you can go
7194304 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world and together we shared the excitement and drama of the games

7194307 i had a family vacation down to a lake in southern utah and just didnt have a razor
7194308 we never even brought up last season thats old news
7194309 we lost a lot of good players it felt a little different but were trying to get the team together
7194310 we have good kids and they are all working their tails off
7194311 some kids have experience but well be different thats for sure
7194312 were a new look a total unknown commodity i dont know what we are right now
7194313 i know im looking to step up as a team leader
7194314 there were so many seniors last year that that wasnt something i had to do before now its up to me and the rest of the kids who started as juniors we can be the ones who set a good example for everyone else
7194315 we never even brought up last season thats old news

7194322 ive had it on my mind since the end of the last game last season being on the same field with southern cal in scott stadium what a blast thats going to be
7194323 its a great chance for a lot of our teams to show the world what we can do
7194324 those are the kinds of games players sort of live for
7194325 rather than moan about it the best thing for the teams in the league to do is use it for motivation and make people forget
7194326 top to bottom the accs going to be better a lot better i think
7194327 but it goes in cycles too if you look around the league i think you see that quickness level getting back up there

7194330 the dog is actually my family pet i felt terrible watching it vomit from the heat of the studio lights i vowed never to shoot another film using a dog
7194331 theres no such thing as a perfect partner and even im not so deluded that i think that the intelligent chio nymphomaniac successful woman who will pander to my every whim and moodswing exists
7194332 else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead
7194333 honey i left a glass of water for you on the nightstand youll be thirsty when you wake up
7194334 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
7194335 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7194336 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
7194337 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
7194338 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
7194339 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
7194340 mamma ik zou toch zooo graag ook een step hebben
7194341 maar steppen zijn voor kinderen die geen speen meer hebben jip en janneke hebben geen speen jij krijgt van mij een step als je je speen opstuurt naar een babytje dat nog geen speen heeft
7194342 lasciate che i girotondini vengano a me e magari nel mio giornale

7194344 con il loro milione di firme ne bastavano anche la met per il nostro referendum
7194345 non abbiamo aperto alcun dialogo elettorale tantomeno con rifondazione comunista noi restiamo fuori da qualsiasi ipotesi di coalizione storicamente intesa
7194346 il ricambio generazionale finch non si conoscono le facce non se ne fa nulla
7194347 che significa poi girotondi tutto e niente noi siamo aperti come abbiamo fatto per le elezioni politiche con pardi e giulietti

7194350 lostracismo non sulla candidatura alla presidenza di orlando ma sullitalia dei valori
7194351 hanno una responsabilit politica e istituzionale e non possono lasciare alla maggioranza anche la facolt di scegliere il presidente di una commissione cos importante
7194352 nessuno mi ha chiesto nulla e credo che non abbiano nemmeno bisogno del cappello dellitalia dei valori
7194353 con ogni mezzo darei a quelle firme e a quelle personalit la possibilit di continuare a scrivere
7194354 that would make the basketball schedule look easy in comparison
7194355 if we could translate the same logic of basketball to football and the end result was a really meaningful competition absolutely wed be interested
7194356 you just cant predict what will happen five or 10 years down the road
7194357 i think the performance was better than our performance against unc greensboro
7194358 our speed of play was much better and our closing down spacing was much better on defense our final third attacking was more creative and we had more chances and went up 2 0 and had a good first half
7194359 all of the players showed energy especially the young guys
7194360 i saw some hungry guys who really want to play
7194361 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement

7194367 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7194368 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7194369 we are continuing to raise our concerns at senior levels of the chinese government and to follow their cases closely
7194370 moet ik hee hee of hee of heej of wat dan ook zeggen

7194378 ik heb gezocht naar een leider die de stijgende kosten waarmee de werkende klasse te maken heeft begrijpt en die de dromen van arbeiders altijd op de eerste plaats zet
7194379 ik ben teruggekomen naar springfield om jullie te vertellen dat ik die leider heb gevonden
7194380 expert op het gebied van buitenlandpolitiek wiens hart diep geworteld is in de werkende klasse
7194381 realiteit is dat gowdiak een significante hoeveelheid onderzoek heeft verricht en natuurlijk is het begrijpelijk dat hij naar een manier zoekt om geld te verdienen aan zijn onderzoek
7194382 dit is niet iets wat iemand in een middagje kan uitvogelen in zijn garage hij gowdiak is duidelijk een slimme vent

7194393 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7194394 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7194395 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7194396 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7194397 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs
7194398 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
7194399 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7194400 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7194401 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7194402 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7194403 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7194404 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7194405 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7194406 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
7194407 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7194408 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
7194409 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
7194410 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7194411 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
7194412 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7194413 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
7194414 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7194415 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
7194416 unless we fundamentally change the rotation dates and fundamentally change how many members of the national guard were calling up itll be virtually impossible to maintain 150 000 folks this year
7194417 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
7194418 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7194419 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7194420 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7194421 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7194422 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7194423 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7194424 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7194425 he has to make people more comfortable with him as a person
7194426 no le tengo miedo a su salida de ch vez el pa s est preparado y ha considerado los errores cometidos para no reincidir
7194427 estamos empezando a cosechar el resultado de una incipiente cultura democr tica que se estableci durante los ltimos 50 a os la gente comprendi que no pod a permitir la elecci n permanente de un presidente ni que le afectaran la propiedad privada o le impusieran el intervencionismo exacerbado del estado esa manera de enfocar la situaci n se ha ampliado y va a estar presente a la hora del voto
7194428 as the olympic games in beijing draw to a close i have been particularly impressed by the british and commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable games in the various disciplines
7194429 like so many people around the world i have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration
7194430 to all the participants and to everyone who has supported them so well i send my warmest congratulations
7194431 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7194432 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success

7194442 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
7194443 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing

7194452 simply get rid of the frame around the picture and create a space and bring the audience into the film space

7194529 the firewall program has blocked all the messages from outside and its against the basic value of democracy and human rights
7194530 i think the first thing that we do is we have a look at how the funding is being utilised and whether we are getting the maximum bang for every one of those taxpayer dollars

7194532 we couldnt all be cowboys so some of us are clowns
7194533 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that
7194534 i think when people are looking at the olympics in 2012 britain home of football where football was invented which we gave to the world i think people would be very surprised if there is an olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it
7194535 i am determined to work with the football associations and the olympic committee to ensure that when we come to 2012 we have a mens football team and we have a womens football team playing
7194536 this is a spectacular own goal for brown he is out of touch with the overwhelming views of football supporters throughout the uk
7194537 all the national supporters groups oppose this move and see it as a threat to the status of their nations to field independent football squads
7194538 not only do all the national supporters associations oppose such a move but the majority of football associations in the uk have said they do not want to take part in a single uk team as it could threaten their existence within fifa

7194557 said sifry co founder of tech president a group blog covering the intersection of politics and technology
7194558 i voted for the property relationships part of the bill because i really felt that the situation there was totally discriminatory
7194559 because i see myself as the elected representative of the people of helensville i try to reflect that in my voting on conscience issues as opposed to a personal vote from my own perspective i had done some polling i wouldnt say it was extensive but i did some polling in my electorate and on the basis of that polling i voted against civil unions
7194560 personally i have no problems with civil unions there was an argument put forward that civil unions would undermine marriage and i never believed that line i have been married for 22 years and the fact that a gay couple may choose to have a civil union would have absolutely no impact on my marriage to my wife
7194561 we have friends who are a gay couple bringing up children i would support any gay or lesbian couple bringing up children i would hope for them what i want for any children and that is for them to give the best parental instruction and love and attention that they can for the children that are in their care
7194562 i think we largely live in a secular society i think there are many religions operating in nz and it is in the best interests of the state to make decisions that are on a secular basis so they dont discriminate im no supporter of these hard right religions for instance i was never offered i would never have accepted any financial support from the exclusive brethren i met them as a constituency mp as i would meet anyone as a constituency mp on constituency issues as i believe its wrong to discriminate but i intend having no contact with the brethren going forward
7194563 i dont care what peoples sexual preferences are its for them to determine that we have friends who are gay and lesbian just as we have dozens of friends who are heterosexual i judge my friends on the basis of the friendship that we have and the support we give each other not on their sexual preferences which as far as i am concerned is their business and their business alone

7194585 when is read that the leaders of poland ukraine estonia and latvia had flown to tbilisi last week to show support for the georgias position i realized that this is serious
7194586 they must be concerned that this could expand throughout eastern europe and the former ussr
7194587 the scale of russias military actions has become enormous and russia is violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of an independent country therefore the presidents of ukraine poland lithuania and estonia have made a decision to meet in tbilisi today and discuss with their georgian counterpart means of resolving the situation
7194588 it is a great worry for us so many people would be affected so many dreams would be shattered
7194589 georgia has sort of been a thorn in russias side for some time because of their desire to join nato you also have a situation of the balkans when nato helped separate kosovo from serbia thats been something the russians have been very vocal in their opposition there are just a whole lot of geo political threads running through this situation
7194590 russia has one of the lowest birth rates in the world 1 17 children per woman a nation needs a birth rate of 2 1 just to replace current population because of its low birth rate and early deaths due to disease and other factors russia is losing approximately 750 000 people a year
7194591 we had an absolutely beautiful orchard with peaches beautiful peaches already ripe why did they destroy the trees and the garden
7194592 the stories that are being told are of random violence stories of killing and intimidation stories of families being broken up and people fleeing for their lives and the lives of their children

7194604 i endorse an expansion of medicare as the best solution to our health care dilemma although there doesnt seem to be a lot of debate about that option
7194605 theres a lot of vested interest in our current system
7194606 people think all i need to have is insurance and if i have insurance everything is going to be fine that really isnt true how many people have insurance and theyre not happy
7194607 just because you have insurance doesnt mean youre going to get the care you need and the care you deserve
7194608 we have a mind set what the public expects is they want the best health care they want the best drugs they want the best technology they want it yesterday
7194609 and the irony is they want somebody else to pay for it and they want someone else to determine how much to pay for it
7194610 has a clear plan of action to address this national concern
7194611 it would appear that vested interest groups have been very effective in blocking efforts to approach this nationally
7194612 it may be that local and state initiatives will be the most fruitful methods for trialing models for expanding health care coverage i suspect getting around interest group barriers is more successful when addressed by local citizens who hold each other personally accountable for the decisions they make
7194613 if we can implement these recommendations we expect to save money in the long term

7194654 residents of baghdad the government imposes collective punishment on us
7194655 in a new development of the methods of the wanton occupation and its agent government the forces called the iraqi army and the police backed by the occupying troops impose collective punishments on the residents of the baghdadi neighborhoods and on the rest of the iraqi areas these punishments include isolating those neighborhoods limiting the movement of citizens after those neighborhoods turned into detention centers this happened through constructing sectarian segregation walls that caused a lot of hardship especially for children elderly people and women who stand in queues under the stifling sun heat noting the presence of many sick people among them the application of this method comes after the targeting of their beasts troops by the national resistance and that is exactly what happened recently in al amiriyah and al saydiyah neighborhoods in baghdad in a way that is similar to what happened before in al fallujah and samaraa
7194656 as we in baghdad residents gathering condemn the application of these inhuman methods by the occupying forces and their agents we call on all international and popular organizations in the arab world to raise their voices to demand a stop to those practices which are considered as a continuation of the massive killing operations that commenced against the iraqi people by the occupation and as an outcome of it

7194662 what happens when you get what you want the growing blogosphere angst
7194663 i just look at each one as an individual case
7194664 people have blogs that become very popular maybe blogging is just the activity of posting content to the web some blogs are journalism and some arent
7194665 gnomedex founder chris pirillo is good at keeping an audience why because he writes good stuff either you write good stuff or you write crap bottom line
7194666 i consider my blog a loss leader for my other businesses
7194667 i do all of those things but ultimately my blog is the heart of it
7194668 from the beginning of my blog in 2004 i decided its not about driving traffic its about driving influence
7194669 from the beginning i said i wasnt going to overblog i was only going to blog when i had something to say
7194670 is that the audience is starting to follow me its really about people wanting to hear what i have to say

7194683 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7194684 we are continuing to raise our concerns at senior levels of the chinese government and to follow their cases closely
7194685 at aug 24 2008 boston globe the u s ambassador to china is pressing chinese officials to immediately release eight americans who were detained for holding pro tibet protests
7194686 it was interesting when we screened the film for some of the parents and the kids
7194687 the parents were really moved they had no idea the kids were thinking those thoughts it just goes to show that if you take the time and pay attention and if youre quiet enough you hear things
7194688 oh how great you are for doing the will of g d you are so strong
7194689 whitney attended the ballet west academy when she was 11 and i saw immediately that she was so advanced for her age
7194690 she has always shown an incredible ability to connect to the style of choreography when she was onstage and with her performance
7194691 but my early training in the other styles really helped me there are certain body movements you dont develop just as a ballet dancer like the quickness of your feet i learned from hip hop classes
7194692 i saw there was something hidden inside so we started retraining from the very beginning even how to point her little pinky because she did not have classical structure but she was very quick and as much as it was difficult for her i saw she was determined and not afraid of anything thats her talent it is a great advantage
7194693 developer leaves open possibility of seeking cash from s l county
7194694 dancing can be used as a springboard to talk about the similarities as well as the differences between us
7194695 they learned a great deal about themselves and each other
7194696 this choreographic model can be used with any kind of diverse population as a tool in fostering greater understanding tolerance and respect for difference
7194697 shes very grounded and manages to work dance and put time into the projects shes working on

7194703 why do they have bikers in kamas to give dem good ol boys something to kill when it aint deer season
7194704 storytelling is a marriage between the mind and the heart
7194705 weve become a visual culture and something is lost but when someone tells a story theres a special something that happens between the storyteller and the listener its a much deeper experience i wouldnt be doing this if there wasnt that special connection
7194706 storytelling has been compared to theater but to me its more like jazz
7194707 during a jazz show you start off with the same chart of music but theres lots of leeway to improvise play off the audience and have fun with it
7194708 i kissed a girl and i liked it hope my boyfriend dont mind it maybe im the only one
7194709 the economics just wont let you keep a trailer park
7194710 they were victims of fraud not co conspirators or perpetrators
7194711 if a grand jury of 25 jurors found us innocent what is it that compels a jury of 12 to find us guilty
7194712 we feel the answer is found in the fact that we were prevented from presenting any evidence and that i was denied appointment of counsel after exhausting all funds available to me because the cftc obtained a freeze on all my assets
7194713 ancient history it was a civil matter that was resolved many years ago
7194714 we dont look around and say is there anyone else we can charge too we take the case they bring to us to see if theres a reasonable expectation we can get a criminal conviction out of it
7194715 just because prosecutors get a referral doesnt mean they shouldnt do their own investigation weve had this case for seven years and were still scratching our heads we dont understand why the people who were found liable are going free and those who werent have been criminally prosecuted
7194716 were close to earning gold leed certification but i think well probably end up with silver we have that one in the bag
7194717 were going to find ourselves with a more attractive building for tenants
7194718 its something more people want but its not a deal breaker at this point
7194719 were very happy to be in a building like this
7194720 we could just be content to be in a leed certified building and do nothing more than that
7194721 es como se podr a esperar frugal pobre y miserable la seguridad se eval a en funci n de la riqueza f sica tangible
7194722 you can bury a lot of trouble digging in the dirt
7194723 we take it as it comes from now on its up to america to love us and vote for us and take us all the way
7194724 they cant define the difference between stripping in a strip club and the performance we do
7194725 in a strip club your main focus is getting out of your clothes as quickly as possible
7194726 its not just about getting naked its about the choreography
7194727 the choreography the staging everything is to support the theme
7194728 we can go down to what they call swimsuit attire
7194729 for burlesque style we add that little tidbit we place the pasties on top of the bras
7194730 under utah law we can get away with flesh colored bras
7194731 their children or families would see as much flesh if they went to a public pool
7194732 we were kind of sad that no one got to see our jewels because there were so many on that costume
7194733 ive seen this re emergence of burlesque and i thought it would be a great art form to bring to salt lake
7194734 right now this is purely a hobby because we love doing it
7194735 we know that we live in a very conservative state and we know that not everybody is going to accept what we do as an art form or a talent
7194736 if we can open up the minds of some of the people here to see that what were doing is not lewd or sexual if we can reach out to some of those people and change their minds that right there is still valuable
7194737 state stepping in as banks bail out of student loans
7194738 deposit here so we can use your money to make our stockholders rich
7194739 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7194740 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7194741 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7194742 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7194743 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7194744 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7194745 democrats have not been this excited at a convention since 1992 when they nominated bill clinton
7194746 it energized our party weve now got a chance to win indiana all obama has to do is carry the same states that sen john kerry carried in 2004 and win illinois indiana and west virginia and he is the president
7194747 we will sit with the indiana delegation and see history made as the first african american is nominated for president
7194748 they will put her name on the ballot so the question is do we actually vote for her if it goes to a vote i vote for her what i imagine will happen is they will run the ballot up to new york and when it is time for her to vote she will withdraw her name and ask all of her delegates to go for barack obama
7194749 it is a foregone conclusion obama has the number of delegates to win
7194750 i was not a slated delegate i had to campaign for it
7194751 i see the convention as bringing everything to fruition letting the first viable female candidate be nominated from the floor on the first ballot letting her delegates vote for her which brings it all to a complete closure it is a great way to unite the party
7194752 i want to be out there educating myself to see how i can be more effective in making my candidate become elected
7194753 this economy has hit my family very hard there has to be a change
7194754 i anticipate shell release her delegates and ask them to back obama so it looks like a unified party
7194755 are at opposite ends of the political spectrum on a number of issues
7194756 it could change the social fabric of america on important social issues
7194757 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7194758 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7194759 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7194760 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7194761 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7194762 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7194763 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7194764 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7194765 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7194766 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7194767 iron source news google comcrow had west nile boston globecrow had west nileboston globe united states 47 read more
7194768 a win win transaction like all voluntary trade who cares if the sellers live in a foreign country when two parties trade each is better off
7194769 this one comes from when i was studying blind contour work
7194770 elevate street art to an art form and give it an ethic
7194771 if putting up stickers and posters is considered vandalism petty at the least and if vandalism is garbage then man sure has left his mark with garbage all over the universe
7194772 they defy age limits these campy little characters that people like
7194773 and most people dont want to have to pay more than about 50 cents for a sticker
7194774 the kid who last night painted a wall in the city thats still drying this morning
7194775 theres no filler here every concert is specifically about something and created for the space its in
7194776 its kind of an extraordinary thing to have a librettist write for two composers at the same time
7194777 but mark came up with ideas for each composer that they took on heartily
7194778 i dont know if he is our most important living american composer but hes my favorite living composer
7194779 he has the most chops of any composer he can write just about anything can write it quickly and can write in any style and when it is done it will sound like his music
7194780 he knows what it is to be on the stage play music and give something to an audience
7194781 everyone thinks they have to write the great american tragedy but people want to go to the theater to enjoy themselves sure they want to come away with a moral question thats been posed or to fall in love with a character or to have a personal catharsis and come out the other side these operas do all of that and they are musically challenging but they are funny and fun its the ultimate combination
7194782 this election is going to be decisive definitely if anwar wins we will be one step closer to taking over the government
7194783 from our assessment we are leading we have to win big it will mean the people reject
7194784 it is un malay to make these allegations anwar has a family and he has five daughters
7194785 politics is one thing but you are shaming a family man i am afraid that if we go overboard in attacking him and accusing him of anti malay it will backfire we will lose votes we saw that happen in the march polls
7194786 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7194787 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7194788 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7194789 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7194790 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7194791 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7194792 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7194793 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7194794 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7194795 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7194796 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7194797 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7194798 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7194799 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7194800 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7194801 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7194802 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7194803 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7194804 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7194805 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7194806 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7194807 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7194808 jos kuntavaalit j rjestett isiin nyt mink puolueen tai muun ryhmittym n edustajaa nest isitte
7194809 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7194810 the band was really much more influenced musically by the who and the kinks than we ever were by the beatles
7194811 what kind of freedom do we have now the freedom to be raped by indian soldiers
7194812 kashmir was one country half was taken by india the other half by pakistan both by force we want freedom
7194813 doodh maango to kheer denge kashmir maango to cheer denge ask for milk youll get cream ask for kashmir well tear you open
7194814 remember o you gujarati hindus o you filthy shameless and foul creatures o you gujarati hindus most immoral and the most gutless cowards remember whom you have fought against you have fought against the inheritors of a messenger of allah of a prophet of allah whose terror was cast on the enemy from a distance of a months journey
7194815 o leader of disbelieving cowards and eunuchs narendra modi o you base born of illegitimate birth o you spineless coward you boast of the pride of gujarat and pride of gujaratis you brag of your filthy faith and conviction in look we are back with the will of allah striking in your own land assaulting and ruining your own cities raiding and ravaging your own territory we swear by allah we will make you o modi an example and a lesson that the enemies of islam should learn from
7194816 the militia of islam whose each and every mujahid belongs to this very soil of india
7194817 the terms democracy secularism equality integrity peace freedom voting elections are yet another fraud with us
7194818 faithless infidels and their hypocrite allies from amongst the so called muslims like arshad madni amp mehmood madni jamiat e ulema i hind leaders and pillars of the deoband fraternity who have bartered their faith in return of just one seat in the parliament
7194819 he is a fanatic he is not a gujarati he is not an indian he claims he is merely a soldier of islam
7194820 if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum
7194821 people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves
7194822 india needs azadi from kashmir as much as kashmir needs azadi from india
7194823 secession of a part of the territory of india from the union includes the assertion of any claim to determine whether such part will remain a part of the territory of india
7194824 which is intended or supports any claim to bring about on any ground whatsoever the cession of a part of the territory of india or the secession of a part of the territory of india from the union or which incites any individual or group of individuals to bring about such cession or secession
7194825 let it be clearly understood the problem in j amp k today is not hindu versus muslim nor is it even jammu region versus the valley
7194826 i got a lot i cant complain everything i got it is just that after that gold i was not able to give my country another medal because of wrist injury or i would have got even more but i got enough
7194827 it is still utterly deceptive because the irrational appeal of proximity to the jackpot motivates the consumer far more than an expressed intent to support the activity advertised
7194828 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7194829 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7194830 einige neue darsteller und ein erster trailer ist auch online

7194832 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7194833 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7194834 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7194835 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7194836 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7194837 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs

7194839 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7194840 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7194841 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7194842 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7194843 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7194844 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7194845 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7194846 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7194847 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7194848 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7194849 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7194850 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7194851 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7194852 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7194853 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7194854 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7194855 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7194856 try to use that word or those words more often
7194857 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7194858 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7194859 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7194860 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7194861 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7194862 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7194863 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7194864 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7194865 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7194866 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7194867 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7194868 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7194869 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7194870 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7194871 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7194872 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7194873 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7194874 decapitamos a mucha gente era una estrategia para promover el terror para que tuvieran m s miedo de nosotros que de la guerrilla
7194875 en urab cuando comenzamos dej bamos los cuerpos en el mismo lugar donde las personas eran muertas
7194876 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7194877 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7194878 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7194879 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7194880 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7194881 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7194882 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7194883 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7194884 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7194885 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7194886 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7194887 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7194888 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7194889 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7194890 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7194891 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7194892 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7194893 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7194894 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7194895 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7194896 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7194897 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7194898 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7194899 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7194900 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night

7194905 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7194906 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it

7194909 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7194910 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7194911 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants

7194919 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7194920 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7194921 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7194922 i told myself to play like i did when i was a kid it was a very pleasing day
7194923 but its hard to expect to duplicate what they just did to you that soon
7194924 if they dont shut down that offense we never get to that point
7194925 the decision makes sense but it was something i didnt want to hear at the time
7194926 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
7194927 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
7194928 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
7194929 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
7194930 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
7194931 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
7194932 me va muy bien ya tengo disco de platino por el lbum una rosa blu y la verdad es que hice un espacio en mi agenda de trabajo porque para m es muy importante fomentar la unidad familiar y qu mejor que a trav s de un programa que re ne las cualidades para sentar a todos a disfrutar sanamente de la televisi n

7194944 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7194945 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7194946 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7194947 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7194948 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7194949 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7194950 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7194951 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7194952 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7194953 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7194954 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7194955 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7194956 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7194957 oh weve got more important things we have to do

7194960 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7194961 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7194962 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7194963 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7194964 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7194965 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7194966 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7194967 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7194968 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7194969 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7194970 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7194971 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7194972 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7194973 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7194974 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7194975 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7194976 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7194977 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7194978 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7194979 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7194980 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7194981 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7194982 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7194983 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7194984 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7194985 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills

7194989 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7194990 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7194991 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7194992 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7194993 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7194994 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7194995 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7194996 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7194997 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7194998 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7194999 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7195000 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7195001 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7195002 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7195003 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7195004 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7195005 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7195006 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7195007 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7195008 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7195009 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7195010 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7195011 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7195012 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7195013 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7195014 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7195015 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7195016 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7195017 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7195018 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7195019 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7195020 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7195021 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7195022 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7195023 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7195024 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7195025 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7195026 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7195027 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7195028 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7195029 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7195030 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7195031 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7195032 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7195033 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7195034 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7195035 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7195036 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7195037 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7195038 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7195039 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7195040 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7195041 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7195042 napada samoubojica raznio se aktivirav i pojas s eksplozivom usred dvorane u kojoj se nalazilo vi e posjetitelja koji su stigli na izlo bu automobila pri emu je ubijeno pet osoba a ozlije eno ih je devet
7195043 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7195044 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7195045 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7195046 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7195047 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7195048 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7195049 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7195050 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7195051 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7195052 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7195053 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7195054 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7195055 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7195056 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7195057 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7195058 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7195059 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7195060 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7195061 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7195062 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7195063 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7195064 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7195065 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7195066 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7195067 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7195068 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7195069 on utjelovljuje onu rijetku mje avinu ve desetlje ima ivi u washingtonu u koji je donio promjene no washington ga nije izmijenio stru njak je za vanjsku politiku ije su vrijednosti duboko usa ene u ameri koj srednjoj klasi
7195070 never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
7195071 never let your name be found in a dead mans trousers
7195072 other towers other turrets protruded from the medieval ch teau they called the temple deceptively religious name but this tower was different larger easily 60 feet in height and black like the inside of a chimney and lord of all its secrets whatever was in there stayed there
7195073 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink
7195074 more than that hell describe the man for you give you his most recent address name all his known conspirators tell you his favorite cheese
7195075 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7195076 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7195077 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7195078 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7195079 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7195080 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7195081 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7195082 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7195083 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7195084 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7195085 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7195086 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7195087 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7195088 they say that our aggression our toughness came out of our slave situation
7195089 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7195090 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7195091 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7195092 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7195093 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7195094 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7195095 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7195096 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7195097 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7195098 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7195099 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7195100 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7195101 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7195102 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7195103 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7195104 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7195105 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7195106 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7195107 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7195108 son youre growing up now pretty soon youll take a bride
7195109 just because youve become a young man now theres still some things that you dont understand now before you ask some girl for her hand now keep your freedom for as long as you can now
7195110 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7195111 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7195112 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7195113 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7195114 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7195115 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7195116 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7195117 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7195118 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7195119 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7195120 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7195121 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7195122 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7195123 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7195124 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7195125 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7195126 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7195127 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7195128 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7195129 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7195130 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7195131 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7195132 los grupos sociales que salen del centro son las clases medias que son din micas econ micamente y pagan impuestos por lo tanto la ciudad comenzar a perder cierta base fiscal cuando las ciudades pierden base fiscal significa que no tendr n la capacidad para generar nueva infraestructura y servicios esto representa que se va a deteriorar la calidad de vida en el municipio

7195135 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
7195136 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
7195137 to date the cftc has found that supply and demand fundamentals offer the best explanation for the systematic rise in oil prices
7195138 regardless of their classification the cftcs market surveillance group scrutinizes daily the positions of all large traders both commercial and non commercial to guard against market manipulation
7195139 when the cftc granted the 1991 hedging exemption to j aron a division of goldman sachs it signaled a major shift that has since allowed investors to accumulate enormous positions for purely speculative purposes
7195140 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit

7195165 freddie mac s chief executive richard syron made the absurd claim that the company s troubles stemmed from his insistence that it reorient itself towards its mission of making affordable housing available to americans

7195183 if hes available well play him but i cant say hes available ive got no idea
7195184 hes one of our best players and knowing what he knows and who hes going to draw well weigh it up
7195185 were not going to expose players who arent right but if its an anthony rocca whos coming off a long term injury and hes available to play well then thats one of the things youd be pretty silly not to do
7195186 i am not about to get involved in how bad or how incidental it is we will judge it through the week
7195187 it is a very competitive market its a lot different to melbourne
7195188 those decisions will be made at the end of the year in terms of how many changes you can make to your list and where that takes you
7195189 brisbane and coach leigh matthews have done a similar job up there theyve remained competitive since their four grand finals 2001 04
7195190 were the two teams in those northern states where its very hard to bottom out but those decisions will be made at the end of the season
7195191 im startled by the criticism giving away medals and bouquets was an international commitment for me after all im also the president of the asian athletics association i just could not be at two places at the same time
7195192 i went when it mattered most i went to see his bouts and also visited him in the olympic village to congratulate him i think that was more important than attending his medal ceremony which i would have done anyway but for this commitment to give away olympic medals
7195193 make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
7195194 i cannot rule out that the state duma will appeal to the countrys leadership to recognise the independence of abkhazia
7195195 once the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia is recognised these territories as independent states can ask russia to admit them which is perfectly allowed by the russian constitution
7195196 right after the conflict with georgia russia would look very indecent if it immediately annexed south ossetia and abkhazia
7195197 russia will be perfectly content if they are pseudo independent states
7195198 now is the time for anyone who makes a morning commute whether across town or across the border to adjust their schedules to accommodate the additional demands that school related traffic places on area roads streets highways and international border crossings
7195199 what happens is everybody tries to cross at the same time and it backs up the line
7195200 a lot of them do spend the summers in mexico or they go for the weekend and on the way back they wait till monday morning to go back to school
7195201 stamps cars baseball cards those hobbies have really gone by the wayside they have nothing on coins
7195202 it gives you a good concept of what the country has gone through just because of the monetary value of that little disc
7195203 it really should be for the sheer pleasure and learning that you get from it
7195204 they came out in 1999 its been about 10 years
7195205 it certainly brings to mind what kind of monster is this
7195206 were blessed to be in an area that a lot of other schools are not in and were being honest and responsible right now were ok but we want to tell taxpayers that were being honest and responsible and earn their respect
7195207 the voters caught us by surprise when they didnt pass the tax increase last year but the community has been very responsive to us
7195208 and we want to maintain that so when we really need them they will support us
7195209 yes weve been building the kitty up but at whose expense its ok to save money but something is giving
7195210 do we not have enough computers in our computer lab or do we have enough printing paper what about insurance for the athletic department so families dont have to buy it
7195211 one of the things homeland security asked about was the regional veterinary assets
7195212 from homeland securitys standpoint a veterinary college is not essential but incarnate words proposal was a nice addition to our package
7195213 we said if the nbaf comes through we would rearrange that menagerie of objectives we have and move a veterinary college to the front

7195217 these rules send a clear signal that the administration will spend the rest of its days razing what remains of the rules and regulations that have kept wildlife like the bald eagle from going extinct
7195218 this listing will not stop global climate change or prevent sea ice from melting
7195219 any real solution requires action by all major economies for it to be effective that is why i am taking administrative and regulatory action to make certain the esa isnt abused to make global warming policies
7195220 the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur
7195221 the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
7195222 the shelves should be packed because its right before school starts
7195223 they could have stocked a little better but its still reasonable
7195224 were constantly restocking throughout the day but a lot of times it doesnt keep up with demand
7195225 we have 30 percent more staff on hand to cover the rush
7195226 were not finding exactly what we need but were making do
7195227 we always wait until now and find pretty much what we need
7195228 i saw all of those people come together and i knew that they were coming together to support me
7195229 that to me is what motivated me i went home and immediately talked to my parents about it
7195230 the impact is not so much the money but it gives young people a sense that somebodys in their corner someone cares and wants to support them
7195231 most of our graduates have stayed in san antonio and work for usaa or are teachers nurses and doctors
7195232 were helping the city to succeed and be really strong economically
7195233 when they walk in the door we say you start right here
7195234 he raised hundreds and hundreds of thousands for hillary in the primary
7195235 to take the next step turning texas back into a blue state will require the foundation being laid by obama now to november
7195236 the challenge is for him committing resources part of the 20 million that his campaign says it will invest in minority outreach nationwide to texas even while understanding that hes not likely to win the state
7195237 if hillary were to come down to the valley again and ask for help for obama i am certain the people here would not let her down
7195238 la se ora hillary drew huge numbers of people who had never before been involved in politics or those who dont often vote
7195239 she has the power to have that loyalty transferred to obama
7195240 i promoted hillary because she knows us she understands us
7195241 i got not 1 cent from her and ill get as much from el negrito
7195242 but our culture has certain racial stereotypes that belong to a time when we lived in small towns and the perception was that we were in real competition with african americans for the few opportunities that were available to minorities
7195243 that among certain segments of the hispanic population particularly the seniors there is a problem with african americans that they progressed while we did not we have to get past that because it is just plain wrong
7195244 will latinos cast a vote for mccain because they cant bring themselves to vote for a black man
7195245 yes some will and others may stay home and others may hold their nose and vote the democratic ticket
7195246 people are not going to stay home and the traditional gop effort to tamp down voting by the elderly by minorities and by the working class all strong democratic voters wont play
7195247 unlike obama mccain is no johnny come lately who just discovered us and who has no record with latinos other than the wonderful speeches he has given on the campaign trail
7195248 driving while intoxicated is a big problem in guadalupe county as it is all over texas
7195249 what we are trying to do is to make these cases easier to prosecute as well as making a point about refusing to do a breathalyzer
7195250 when the state gives you a drivers license there are conditions on it and one of them is that if you are stopped for dwi you will give breath or blood
7195251 guadalupe county officials are planning no refusal weekend for dwi suspects
7195252 amid the echo of bad news a few words of optimism
7195253 he works full time now for saws and does not work for them anymore
7195254 the very life of the city of uvalde will be adversely affected for generations to come and it would threaten the economic life of the city of uvalde
7195255 for me the uvalde thing is not on the front burner kinney and val verde water is on the front burner
7195256 we dont want to buy water at the expense of problems with the communities it came from
7195257 in the four years ive been on the board its gone from looking for alternative sources of water to looking at the same source of water
7195258 when they put in a pipeline its going to go below that 285 feet
7195259 this project has to do more than profit rights holders i get that
7195260 its sort of like the rumor that disney is coming to san antonio it comes up every couple of years
7195261 it was so speculative that frankly i tossed it into my mental file cabinet
7195262 i warned smith that the response probably wasnt going to be favorable
7195263 in my opinion they wanted to be able to show lawmakers that they did their due diligence the problem is they didnt have any answers
7195264 were trying to be up front were trying to tell people what we are up to
7195265 this group has by far deeper pockets than ive seen
7195266 it seemed like all of a sudden this project was on everybodys radar
7195267 it seems kind of interesting that saws would be the biggest party interested in our water and robert puente is now its interim president and marc rodriguez is leading the charge with rod smith for this pipeline
7195268 it just makes you a little nervous the connection between saws and this group out here
7195269 he has disclosed that to us and its been vetted by our legal department
7195270 marc mentioned that he was being pursued by this group and he assured me that if there was a conflict he would resolve it
7195271 first off saws has not received any proposal for water from any of those western counties
7195272 and securing water must be done in compliance with state procurement laws so its not as easy as receiving a proposal and signing a contract
7195273 we are creating a project consortium that will include a nationally recognized company to build the pipeline and related well field an experienced operator of municipal systems and an internationally recognized u s investment bank that will assure that the project gets properly financed
7195274 we are putting up all the risk and capital for this
7195275 so we need to look at other options and among them is western water
7195276 i just dont think it would be the right thing to do uvalde county has a growing agricultural base

7195291 i dont know why people think its a gift to be able to find someones weakness and write about it or talk about it or comment about it orourke weakness or finding a weakness in david gillick it should be a matter of finding a strength and telling youngsters this is what you have and this is what you can become she beats herself down and david beats himself down they are professionals and they are looking towards the next step they know the weight they carry from ireland and i think they can handle it but they need support they are two strong heads and they can go a long way
7195292 as a result of the expansion of our product offerings for the current generation of consoles mad catz reached an important inflection point in the first quarter of 2008 as sales for the current generation of consoles surpassed those of the prior generation for the first time
7195293 during the first quarter mad catz also made significant progress in extending our geographic reach and product diversification by leveraging our acquisition of leading pc peripherals provider saitek
7195294 we believe we can significantly reduce sg amp a as a percentage of net sales from the levels recorded in the first quarter and we remain focused on effecting further cost management initiatives to improve our operating efficiency
7195295 consistent with our initiative to further strengthen our portfolio of globally recognized brand licenses during the first quarter mad catz entered into several agreements to align our products with some of the most popular and recognizable franchises worldwide our new manchester united liverpool and arsenal football club licenses should help leverage the increased penetration our products are gaining throughout europe while our rayman raving rabbids r and petz r licenses should help broaden our portfolio of products appealing to a younger demographic these recent agreements add further depth to what we consider to an impressive portfolio of brand licenses and we expect our licensed product lines to be an important driver of sales for mad catz for the upcoming holiday season and through this fiscal year
7195296 while there is still progress to be made mad catz has proven its ability to successfully execute upon its goals to gain traction on the current generation of consoles diversify its product lines expand its geographic presence and achieve improved gross margins as a result we are poised to enter the holiday season with a broad suite of products and deep portfolio of entertaining brand licenses which we believe favorably positions mad catz to capitalize upon the success of our products and the strength of the interactive entertainment industry and generate shareholder value

7195312 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7195313 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7195314 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7195315 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7195316 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7195317 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7195318 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7195319 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change
7195320 as a woman she was a role model to me
7195321 we started out in the same area of law and i liked her efforts for reforming health care
7195322 i think hes a born leader and has the ability to inspire
7195323 she wants this convention to see shes behind obama and her delegates are behind obama
7195324 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7195325 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7195326 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7195327 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7195328 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7195329 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7195330 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7195331 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7195332 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7195333 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7195334 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7195335 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7195336 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7195337 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7195338 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7195339 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7195340 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7195360 six months ago russia began sending cruise missile capable bear h bombers on sallies along the coast of alaska
7195361 for moscow the caucasus is a geopolitical backyard rich in energy resources and crucial to the conflict in chechnya moscows refusal to remove its military bases from georgia specifically in so ossetia has long fueled tensions between the two countries georgias president mikhail saakashvili came into office saying the removal of the russian troops would be high on his governments priority list the us whose own stakes in the caucasus include a multi billion dollar caspian oil pipeline backs this demand
7195362 when russia invaded georgia the brief war ignited an immense barrage of analogies and comparisons it was germany taking the sudetenland 1938 or the soviet union rolling tanks into czechoslovakia 1968 all over again we will see which ones if any are apt but one that occurs to me is the hungarian revolt of 1956 and how the soviets brutally extinguished it afterward some inquiring minds in the u s government wondered whether the hungarians had been led to expect u s help they found in the records of radio free europe several broadcasts that implied that foreign aid would be forthcoming yet another analogy occurs the speech that secretary of state dean acheson delivered to the national press club in 1950 excluding south korea from the u s defensive perimeter in asia later that year the north koreans went over the 38th parallel and the korean war began had the north koreans been listening

7195364 russias relations with ukraine and the baltic states have worsened in recent years as estonia latvia and lithuania joined nato and the european union and ukraine has tried to follow in their path one man was killed in riots and demonstrations between the estonian russian diaspora and police in tallinn last year after the estonians moved a second world war monument that had been erected in the city by the soviet regime russia has complained that ethnic russians are discriminated against in the baltic states an accusation that the eu has supported in some cases ukraine and the baltic states were quick to support georgia

7195402 hit enter a few times resumed the thought process from the preceding paragraph and found my train of thought again
7195403 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7195404 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7195405 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7195406 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7195407 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7195408 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7195409 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7195410 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7195411 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7195412 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7195413 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7195414 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7195415 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7195416 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7195417 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7195418 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7195419 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7195420 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7195421 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7195422 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7195423 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7195424 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

7195426 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7195427 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7195428 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7195429 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7195430 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7195431 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7195432 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7195433 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7195434 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7195435 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7195436 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7195437 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7195438 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7195439 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7195440 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7195441 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7195442 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7195443 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7195444 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7195445 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7195446 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7195447 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7195448 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7195449 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7195450 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7195451 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7195452 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7195453 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7195454 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7195455 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7195456 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7195457 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7195458 who are open to doing something on the production side
7195459 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7195460 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7195461 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7195462 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7195463 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7195464 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7195465 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7195466 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7195467 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7195468 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7195469 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7195470 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7195471 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7195472 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7195473 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7195474 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7195475 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7195476 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7195477 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7195478 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7195479 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7195480 things get so muddled up everything gets fuzzy people forget to appreciate things that matter and a hurricane comes through and sets everything strate suddenly ever one is worried for their loved ones and every one starts preying again its like for a week after the huricane in all the mess and tragidy that gets left behind there is clerity in more then one sence this day i felt like god was showing me why these things happen because every one needs clear water every now and again even if its hard to understand at the time
7195481 more drugs or were shuttin this place down for a while

7195487 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7195488 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7195489 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7195490 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7195491 vaya algo bueno tuve que hacer para conseguir esto funcion mi m todo
7195492 i thought he was great tonight particularly after coming off a really bad start
7195493 i got a long way to go to redeem myself
7195494 im not going to sit here and i said it last time im not going to sit on a good win just because i had a bad start before and now things are better
7195495 i owe a lot more to myself and this team this year to i guess redeem myself im proud of this start im going to take the positives of this start and try to mimic them for my next start but in no way shape or form am i totally redeemed from the two bad starts that have been among the last four
7195496 you know this is the time of year when you get a little tired you appreciate games like this because they dont come around as often as they do early in the season when you feel fresh and when you have good bat speed
7195497 tonight was a good night it was a game that we really needed to win brandon came out and established a good tempo or tone for the game and we were able to score some runs it was a good night for us all the way around
7195498 i watched what roy did and kind of used what i could use from him and then i had the stuff to figure it out on my own how to get them out i just had the stuff i had a plan and the execution was there
7195499 its always a little bit easier when you get some runs earlier in the ballgame
7195500 it allows the pitcher to go out and relax i thought brandon was very very sharp he attacked the zone pretty good
7195501 never give out any information about the club itself to outsiders
7195502 dont get overly friendly with someone who is not a regular acquaintance of the club
7195503 everyone was apprehensive and one bar even closed while the bandidos are in town
7195504 but theyve been no trouble at all theyve been a lot more civil than our regular customers

7195522 i thought about it should i ask mahe or is it unfair to ask an athlete and put him under that pressure

7195548 i dont know that we can blame canterbury students for this one there was only a small number of canterbury students here we may have to look at otago students this time
7195549 its too bad that the governments of these people werent able to share in this like the average people did what if the spirit of oneness that was exhibited by the various people from so many disparate nations from across the globe could translate into a long term setting aside the differences that divide countries and people today maybe we just got a glimpse of what peace on earth is like

7195552 we say its just as important to wash your inside as your outside so weve got to get them enthusiastic and i hope theyre gradually getting a taste for clean water
7195553 some of the mothers were a bit nervous about ooh rainwater pond water is what weve been using you know boiled pond water but a bit murky
7195554 we got a letter from the pasteur institute which said the water is fine so the mothers are feeling pretty relaxed now about this nice clean water
7195555 for me hes a fulfilment of what the buddhist story is all about being satisfied with life being happy you can tell hes happy because hes always laughing and smiling
7195556 thats something that you dont always see in abbots around south east asia and even australia sometimes theyre a bit grumpy
7195557 but hes never grumpy are you youre never grumpy particularly when you get two lots of cement out of me two tonnes
7195558 always cheer me up always cheer me up you do when i think its too hard or too hot you cheer me up
7195559 you see a lot more monks now than you used to there used to be not too many monks around cause a lot of them were killed and now you see monks going out on their dhyana rounds in the morning
7195560 so theres endless things we can do to take advantage of the synergy weve already created
7195561 im not going to get involved in doing accounting for a state agency we would have the state looking over our shoulder at records and all of that
7195562 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
7195563 we get in a good spot to take the division lead and the last couple outings i go out and give it back to the white sox im just tired of doing that id like to go out in a big situation and get a win for us
7195564 its just frustrating to go out there and struggle the way i did the last couple outings i couldnt get the team a win its starting to get pretty old
7195565 you wouldnt want to do that too many times walk anybody to get to vlady but with blackburns sinker on the mound youre going to try to get a ground ball and see what happens he got a fly ball should have been a sac fly one run in

7195579 i know matts down because he didnt play as well as he would have liked
7195580 this competition being pushed by kurt has made matt tougher its one of the things you have to be as a quarterback
7195581 thats way more important than the outcome of the game nobody remembers those outcomes they really dont matter we lost two significant parts of what our offense hoped to be
7195582 we didnt run the ball as well with matt as we did with kurt
7195583 it helps a quarterback to do that it wasnt all matt i was pleased with the response of our team the way we responded just based on what matts done this spring what hes done this camp tonight doesnt negate any of that
7195584 no matter what the down and distance was we were out there throwing the ball
7195585 it was pretty fun at the same time the run game will help out
7195586 unfortunately i think that i saw what i already knew
7195587 if we try to just throw the ball around you are going to get penalties you are going to get your qb hit he is going to start running around a lot he will be in trouble
7195588 its amazing this is what i get paid to do this is what i live for
7195589 this is all i really want to go out there every fifth day and do my job
7195590 last year battling through this surgery and having this team behind me with their support its meant everything
7195591 ninety pitches in five innings isnt going to cut it every time out i realize that but its a big win for the team right now
7195592 hes in our rotation and thats the bottom line i think it means a lot to him especially what hes been through to be able to come out and contribute at such an important time of year
7195593 obviously he wasnt lighting up the radar gun but you dont have to do that in this game if you hit your spots
7195594 i think he wanted to get out there and prove himself to new york
7195595 thats the most important thing if youre out to prove something to everyone else i think it takes away a special part of being in the major leagues
7195596 obviously theres been a lot going on the last four years i cant ignore that but im still the same person i was four years ago when i go out there on the mound
7195597 weve won gold medals in the past but out of any year this has been the best competition from top to bottom usa basketball has ever seen not to take anything away from other teams
7195598 the dream team was a once in a lifetime kind of team more older and a more mature team this is a very talented young team you put the dream team and this team and i dont think you put anyone else in the same breath those are the top two then you can argue it
7195599 we had the one day friday where it kind of came back thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better the treatment and stuff is definitely working
7195600 so were dealing with that too the doctors say its going to help so were going with it
7195601 i think that was part of the problem yesterday having that whole day off and not doing any treatments
7195602 it was getting a lot better and then the other day it jumped back up on me
7195603 well see whats going on before we start pushing it again its not worse its just not getting better
7195604 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7195605 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7195606 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7195607 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7195608 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7195609 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee
7195610 ill tell you what makes me angry seeing my quarterback get off the ground
7195611 thats the thing thats hurting me right now to see carson getting hit
7195612 this was the type of game we kind of looked at as a unit
7195613 we wanted to have a good showing defensively they obviously didnt have their top guns
7195614 he had a good pregame but i wanted to err on the side of caution
7195615 im excited about where hes at right now but i held him back we didnt want to go through the scenario of him having a setback
7195616 fool me once shame on you fool me six times shame on mike brown
7195617 its great we love to celebrate we were 1 15 last year and we really got away from all that enjoyment of winning and things like that so just to go out and get two preseason games under our belt we just need to continue and push this into the regular season
7195618 with a guy like ted hes got something that you cant coach and thats speed
7195619 its so important to have speed its so hard to score with 12 and 15 play drives on a consistent basis you have to have that quick fire power to be able to score on a big play and ted has that
7195620 i think to put two games together back to back like this we didnt have the best week of practice we fought through and we didnt give up
7195621 to come out here and play ball like this i think were starting to believe in what were doing
7195622 i think these guys are embarrassed about the way they played
7195623 anytime you get shut out if youre an offense youd better be embarrassed
7195624 the initial x rays were negative about any serious damage
7195625 were going to get an mri and well have a stronger evaluation for you sunday
7195626 all we pretty much had to do is run we didnt have to make many cuts
7195627 if youre going to take a whipping like this get it out of way now and come back and respond
7195628 i had a little bit more confidence tonight and especially when one of your first runs is a big run it builds confidence
7195629 but i think what you saw was the explosiveness of both backs
7195630 i cut a couple loose nothing tightened up after i let one go
7195631 if he feels all right hell go to the bullpen monday beyond bullpen thats beyond monday
7195632 i had to look around on the mound just to make sure i knew what i was doing you dont think youre gone that long and then you get back on and it seems like youre throwing a mile away
7195633 you get that peace of mind to know you can still throw i want to get into a game just to get back in there and try to help the team win
7195634 i dont have any doubt hell pitch this year weve got to try to figure out what hes going to do but a day at a time
7195635 if you run out of games in the minor leagues then theres simulated games theres a lot of different things you can do
7195636 its amazing this is what i get paid to do this is what i live for
7195637 this is all i really want to go out there every fifth day and do my job
7195638 last year battling through this surgery and having this team behind me with their support its meant everything
7195639 ninety pitches in five innings isnt going to cut it every time out i realize that but its a big win for the team right now
7195640 hes in our rotation and thats the bottom line i think it means a lot to him especially what hes been through to be able to come out and contribute at such an important time of year
7195641 obviously he wasnt lighting up the radar gun but you dont have to do that in this game if you hit your spots
7195642 i think he wanted to get out there and prove himself to new york
7195643 thats the most important thing if youre out to prove something to everyone else i think it takes away a special part of being in the major leagues
7195644 obviously theres been a lot going on the last four years i cant ignore that but im still the same person i was four years ago when i go out there on the mound
7195645 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7195646 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7195647 lets make it real clear im not apologizing for it
7195648 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7195649 i cut a couple loose nothing tightened up after i let one go
7195650 if he feels all right hell go to the bullpen monday beyond bullpen thats beyond monday
7195651 i had to look around on the mound just to make sure i knew what i was doing you dont think youre gone that long and then you get back on and it seems like youre throwing a mile away
7195652 you get that peace of mind to know you can still throw i want to get into a game just to get back in there and try to help the team win
7195653 i dont have any doubt hell pitch this year weve got to try to figure out what hes going to do but a day at a time
7195654 if you run out of games in the minor leagues then theres simulated games theres a lot of different things you can do
7195655 anytime your name is with someone like gehrig and ruth its pretty special
7195656 to be quite honest with you i dont even think about it much because were trying to win games here thats something you reflect on maybe when your careers over
7195657 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7195658 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7195659 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7195660 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7195661 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7195662 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7195663 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7195664 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7195665 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7195666 we dont know the exact severity but he is moving around bucs coach jon gruden said after the game won by the jaguars 23 17
7195667 the signs are good but its a scary thing were praying for him obviously but we do have good news from the standpoint that he is moving around
7195668 but if you look in front of you you tend not to hit stuff i was trying to be smart and cautious but it didnt do me any good
7195669 we were just blocked in behind a bunch of cars and then a bunch of cars in front of me started wrecking said kahne who dropped to 14th in the points race with three races left only the top 12 drivers can contend for the championship
7195670 we just took out a bunch of cars for no reason and ourselves im pretty upset about it
7195671 ive watched caseys career from the time he first came in and hes always impressed me childress said at bristol motor speedway
7195672 i think i was pulling for you about as hard as i was for our cars
7195673 weve got some things working on that childress said without elaborating
7195674 im a team player and thats how i like to race he said
7195675 to me what makes this sport what it is is the fans avidness whether its for or against the four time champion said
7195676 its that theyre so interested in whats going on that they know all they know about the teams the drivers the races and they form an opinion thats the key getting people involved with their opinions whether we like them or not
7195677 you know its just part of the expectations that are on this team he said
7195678 weve been at a very high end of competition and in the limelight a lot of the years thats a good thing to win four championships and 81 wins all those things those are fantastic
7195679 when the expectations are high and you dont live up to them its going to create a story
7195680 this has been a pattern either saturday sunday and monday between 11 a m and 2 p m a fire would start at griffith park in that region of the park the northwest region west of the zoo near travel town

7195684 ja het zou dus fijn zijn als een monteur langs kan komen
7195685 nee hoor niet iedereen is zo achterlijk om met drank op te gaan rijden

7195694 for years the ms society has had a library available to support the information needs of people affected by ms but there has been no way for people to search it themselves and access the documents

7195701 we took a bunch of cars out for no reason i was just running along heard clear clear and went up there and there was someone still there
7195702 im pretty upset about it there were a lot of people that got involved in that which shouldnt have been involved because it shouldnt have happened
7195703 we want to put the best possible group out there that we can right now hes just been struggling throwing strikes so we want to just let him go down there and work out some of the kinks

7195706 today is a special day we hope its the beginning we have opened the path and we hope there will be more travelers
7195707 in order to avoid a well publicized provocation in the middle of the sea
7195708 because we know who is on the boats and what they contain we will allow them to land
7195709 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7195710 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7195711 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7195712 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
7195713 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
7195714 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
7195715 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
7195716 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
7195717 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
7195718 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
7195719 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
7195720 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
7195721 as the army moves closer they will have to rely more on infantry
7195722 we are getting to the stage of close quarter fighting and that is when we can expect more casualties
7195723 though our future targets would be more challenging i am sure we would be able to face them
7195724 it is a high risk gamble the army is taking and they must be careful to ensure that they dont repeat the mistakes of the past and spread themselves too thinly
7195725 curfew is in force please dont come out of your homes
7195726 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7195727 such repressive measures will not work we will emerge stronger and more vibrant
7195728 im in favor of another agreement whatever it takes to stop the conflict but you know it just cannot have as a tradeoff the criminals going scott free

7195733 creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way
7195734 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7195735 creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way
7195736 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7195737 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7195738 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7195739 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7195740 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7195741 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7195742 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7195743 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7195744 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7195745 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7195746 seeing tougher race allies ask obama to make hope specific
7195747 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7195748 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7195749 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7195750 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7195751 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7195752 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7195753 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7195754 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7195755 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7195756 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7195757 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7195758 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7195759 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them

7195763 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7195764 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7195765 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7195766 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7195767 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener

7195779 its like the taking of a portrait of the united states right now
7195780 what we are hoping to do is to engage with people who are going to be here not necessarily as the delegate count but folks who are certainly here with political agendas and ideas on their minds
7195781 we really wanted to push that message about what can happen to a society when leaders arent questioned or when theyre intimidated by leadership
7195782 we agreed that it was also an unprecedented opportunity for us with the convention being here in denver if we had the means and the funds wed be in minneapolis as well
7195783 were telling people who are making political theater that theyve got a safe place to store props during the daytime maybe make puppets and banners and things
7195784 theres that question of you dont know whats going to happen
7195785 the goal with this is to bring the video to the play and make it an intrinsic aspect of the play
7195786 when i got back from iraq and people would ask me about the war i would read to them from my journals
7195787 people said you should develop this as a performance piece but mostly i was just battling my depression
7195788 i understand where theyre coming from and i get it but i believe its a very dangerous time for the nation that i love and i have to put all my energy in a place where it might make a difference thats not to say i put all my faith in the democrats so far theyve let me down in a big way
7195789 those people who come to the democratic national convention are gonna know heres an iraq war veteran 10 blocks from the convention center for a month telling his story now the number of people that make that 10 block walk or drive is going to let me know if the democrats talk about were really the party that supports the troops is political talk or if theres any reality to it
7195790 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7195791 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but i consider him a good friend and good man
7195792 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well
7195793 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties countries
7195794 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7195795 hoewel het niet alleen om je uiterlijk gaat er hoort een praatje bij en een plan voor als je wint en een jaar lang ambassadrice bent de bedoeling is wel dat je iets met je titel doet
7195796 om te laten zien dat je er met een beperking ook leuk uit kunt zien vrolijk kunt zijn dat er dus niks mis mee is
7195797 je kunt wel in een hoekje kruipen en je zielig voelen en soms doe ik dat natuurlijk ook maar dat heeft niet veel zin je moet toch verder dan kun je dat maar beter met wat lol doen
7195798 niemand zegt het in je gezicht maar niemand staat te springen om je met een beperking aan te nemen

7195802 sen barack obamas wife and three close advisers have been involved with a program at the university of chicago medical center that steers patients who dont have private insurance primarily poor black people to other health care facilities michelle obama currently on unpaid leave from her 317 000 a year job as a vice president of the prestigious hospital helped create the program which aims to find neighborhood doctors for low income people who were flooding the emergency room for basic treatment hospital officials say such patients hinder their ability to focus on more critically ill patients in need of specialized care such as cancer treatment and organ transplants

7195812 furthers californias compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation
7195813 the california supreme courts decision proves that these activist judges are willing to deny our first amendment religious freedom in order to create rights for homosexuals
7195814 this case was never about discrimination against patients on the basis of sexual choices it was about discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7195815 physicians of course must treat all patients with compassion and respect regardless of the belief systems or sexual norms of the patients
7195816 but tolerance is a two way street we must also respect the right of healthcare professionals to make decisions based on ethical standards
7195817 today californias highest court unanimously ruled that the states civil rights laws offer virtually no exceptions for people of faith
7195818 a religious objector has no federal constitutional right to an exemption from a neutral and valid law of general applicability on the ground that compliance with that law is contrary to the objectors religious beliefs
7195819 for instance the ruling probably means that regardless of their beliefs everyone in the states wedding industry must service gay weddings california family law attorneys must handle gay adoptions and same sex divorces and so on
7195820 if homosexual marriage remains legal the courts will soon start mandating homosexual marriage ceremonies in all churches
7195821 this decision reaches beyond the medical profession taking away the first amendment rights of healthcare professionals puts at risk the rights of every working american
7195822 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever

7195828 a man may deal with theory and miss the whole impact of the truth
7195829 ive said for a long time that my most important goal was to leave swimming better than i found it and this move to network coverage on nbc of our major championships is a dream come true and a big step in that direction
7195830 my mom has told me that i better make the 2009 u s world championships team because she wants to go to rome i have the pressure from the mom so i guess we have to get back into it and make that happen
7195831 the whole world watched as michael phelps took his sport to a new level and introduced a generation of fans to swimming through his extraordinary achievements his accomplishments transcend sports and are in fact a cultural phenomenon were greatly looking forward to following the next chapter in his career
7195832 were thrilled with our evolving partnership with nbc having nbc broadcast the 2009 fina world championships is a huge step forward for our sport
7195833 our new 50mb service will deliver even faster lightning broadband speeds which is why we feel that usain will be the perfect ambassador for our campaign
7195834 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
7195835 here we are in the situation in which the finish is questionable and the ultimate judge of truth is refusing to make public information that may be nothing short of catastrophic for phelps omega phelpss other sponsors and the americans in general who certainly do not want their wonder boys amazing feat tarnished
7195836 this issue may end up being very damaging to phelps omega and the usa sadly it could have been avoided with careful thought and basic ethical advice
7195837 its our job to provide the results fina decides what can be published or not fina said it was a no go
7195838 omega provides the most accurate and reliable measurement system in the world
7195839 the professionalism and independence of its teams are recognized by the highest authorities of sport
7195840 everything is good what are you going to do with the footage see what the serbians already saw it is clarified for us beyond any doubt
7195841 the result of the race as declared by the federation is final and the ioc has no reason to question it
7195842 that sort of stuff is an issue that fina deals with
7195843 we dont get involved with what happens in the pool like that
7195844 i dont see how the company decides the outcome of a race
7195845 only a very few will make it they will do so by being great in the next few years working in the media
7195846 these athletes need to have an additional hook a story pursuit or career that transcends their olympic glory
7195847 the olympics may well be a door opener to the future but success relies on offering something distinctive just being an olympian is no guarantee

7195853 from where winston stood it was just possible to read picked out on its white face in elegant lettering the three slogans of the party war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
7195854 we could have doubted each other when darrel got injured and when aaron armstrong got injured there were so many obstacles in the way but we had faith in god and belief in ourselves and we were able to pull it together
7195855 to be honest even with a full strength team the result would have been the same
7195856 we just want to dedicate this one to trinidad and tobago red white and black
7195857 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
7195858 usain is out there enjoying himself the us has done it for years i dont know why theyre now criticising people for it

7195862 usain gave asafa the baton and asafa looked like some kinda star running down the track surrounded only by jah breeze
7195863 i dunno much about sports eh but i know i prefer the running allyuh eh see dem man boomsie dem swimmers eh have dem kinda ass phelps and dem boomsie flat flat
7195864 the americans are saying we are emerging as a world force we were always a force when you look back a jamaican a trini a bahamian even the smaller islands one of us was always 2nd or 3rd behind an american but you cannot compete with man who taking drugs to win thank god for wada
7195865 my hand was there the stick was there what im telling people is that the stick had a mind of its own its not my fault its not her fault its not either of our fault
7195866 i wanted to do a little better but things didnt work out too well im happy olympic finalist im the seventh fastest person in the world im not complaining all of us are just human beings and no one is greater than the other its who wants it the most and i really wanted to reach this stage this is what ive been praying for this is what ive been working for whole year to reach this stage i was just praying to reach the finals and whatever happen happen
7195867 god made adam and eve not adam and steve so your question is ridiculous

7195883 the unknown god negative theology in the platonic tradition plato to eriugena
7195884 for i am already being poured out as a drink offering and the time of my departure is at hand i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith finally there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will give me on that day and not to me only but also to all who have loved his appearing
7195885 do you not know that those who run in a race all run but one receives the prize run in such a way that you may obtain it and everyone who competes for prize is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a perishable crown but we for an imperishable crown therefore i run thus not with uncertainity thus i fight not as one who beats the air but i discipline my body and bring it into subjection lest when i have preached to others i myself should become disqualified
7195886 therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in its lusts and do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin but present yourselves to god as being alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness to god for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under law but under grace

7195888 i have been crucified with christ it is no longer i who live but christ lives in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
7195889 but god forbid that i should boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world has been crucified to me and i to the world
7195890 now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to god our savior who alone is wise be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and forever amen

7195897 i think some women do i know some of you women on here are not this way so this is not directed at you but again they are women that would rather deal with a loser ass dude that is still selling you his dreams and is abusive verbally and physically get pregnant still stay with the loser he makes you cry keeps making you cry and you still go back with him and after all of that you still avoid the good dudes
7195898 the story i am about to tell you my dear is of great importance for if there is one thing i have learned over many years is that one needs to remember so that one will be able to pass on to the young certain truths about the rising in the year 1745 which have truly never been told in full
7195899 i was in the year 43 1743 i had been married less then a year and had returned with your grand father john from our honeymoon on the continent

7195910 if i lose one or two its not a problem for me because i have a minimum 24 or 25
7195911 i dont know if some clubs want shaun wright phillips and i dont know what the player thinks about offers from other teams but as ive said before if i have 24 or 25 and three or four players for two positions i am happy
7195912 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7195913 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7195914 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7195915 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7195916 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7195917 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7195918 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7195919 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7195920 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry

7195939 fue una jornada muy interesante quedaron debidamente aprobadas las reformas que fueron propuestas por el priismo de nuevo le n en nuestras diferentes asambleas
7195940 un aspecto importante es en el sentido de que quedar n autom ticamente fuera del partido aquellos compa eros que lo hayan traicionado yendo a colaborar en campa as con candidatos con militantes y con otros partidos pol ticos de tal suerte que autom ticamente quedar n fuera de nuestro instituto pol tico
7195941 habr un periodo de espera porque despu s de las modificaciones tendremos que presentarlas ante el instituto federal electoral como rgano m ximo electoral que deber aprobarlas
7195942 se aprobaron temas importantes como la definici n de los m todos de elecci n se aprob la adaptaci n del concepto ideol gico de la social democracia en nuestra declaraci n de principios y realmente fue una jornada muy interesante en donde predomin la unidad el trabajo y el consenso entre los que integramos este asamblea nacional
7195943 hubo una serie de adecuaciones que permitir n tener un proceso muy ordenado para el pr ximo a o electoral de nuevo le n en primer lugar una definici n de posesi n de partido en los temas que m s preocupan a la sociedad mexicana que nos da certidumbre y validez y orientaci n como partido para dar una oferta de poder cumplir con las espectativas de la ciudadan a en cuanto un partido que ofrezca candidatos que puedan ser de alguna manera fundamentales en la toma de decisones de las responsabilidades que le toca
7195944 hay un deslinde de las responsabilidades individuales de quienes estrinjan las leyes electorales y no es necesariamente una responsabilidad del partido sino de los que tengan en ese caso su responsabilidad espec fica
7195945 it was never my deal it was your media deal
7195946 sometimes youve all done things where you press i think there was some of that i think you put a lot of pressure on yourselves sometimes and it affects your ability to perform
7195947 in this case i just think it was a matter of him going out and relaxing having fun getting that smile back on his face and i saw that tonight i think the way the offensive line played has something to do with that he looked like his old self to me
7195948 you might have to think of a couple new things to write this week
7195949 but hey whatever its just good for morale to get in the end zone
7195950 i said theyre really going to make this thing hard
7195951 he gave me the opportunity to catch the ball and i just tried to make a play on it
7195952 we just cant afford to have more losses than milwaukee or chicago weve got to bounce back tomorrow and keep doing what weve been doing all year fighting and see what happens
7195953 whats a quality start three runs in six innings with a two run lead hes not happy giving that lead up no matter how thats defined i know hes not happy
7195954 pujols was just playing deep and you kind of have to wait a little bit to throw the ball
7195955 obviously i dont want to hit him in the back while hes still running to the bag
7195956 he fouled em off and fouled em off until i got one a little wide its one of the better battles ive ever had
7195957 that was a well earned extra three runs it gave us some breathing room with pujols possibly coming up
7195958 it would have been a tough save for the other side
7195959 if they get it you tip your cap but that would have been a tough save
7195960 im going to wait a little while but if nothing improves im going to have surgery
7195961 that way if i want to pitch i can pitch
7195962 is it worth it to come back for seven more
7195963 somebodys going to have to want me first well have to see
7195964 i thought i could keep pitching i was tired of going on the dl it turned out i couldnt keep pitching
7195965 i wouldnt do a single thing different if i had done anything differently earlier in my career i wouldnt have gotten this far
7195966 we are trying to win games and we have got no cushion quite literally were game to game look at how weve done it all year long were not going to make adjustments to it now
7195967 i dont want him to think about relief he should think start
7195968 wed each gladly trade a batting title for success of our team
7195969 were right there neck and neck and theres still a long way to go
7195970 hes had a great series so far im fighting it right now ill go ahead and say it right now hes the best hitter in the league regardless of who wins the batting title or who finishes second
7195971 the way he hit in atlanta the last series made you take notice
7195972 one guy in the league makes that play and thats pujols
7195973 adam laroche used to work on it but i never saw him make it if you miss game over he just doesnt miss

7195978 i tell people that the corner of woodmen and powers is going to be the middle of town
7195979 its going to be the corner of main and main all the growth is going in that direction
7195980 you only have a couple of east west thoroughfares in colorado springs
7195981 now youve got a big population in the falcon area and its filling in between powers and falcon so woodmen is just a natural for development
7195982 aside from continued food assistance what we really need are sleeping mats mosquito nets and blankets
7195983 it is not just about a person hit by a bullet but those of deprived of their education because schools have been disrupted by the fighting conflict makes people suffer
7195984 we are building water reservoirs and distributing hygiene kits aside from mattresses and mosquito nets
7195985 we bought the tent at the market so the children and our belongings would not get wet when there would be rains my husband would sleep outside our covered cart because it could not longer accommodate him
7195986 we are really very pitiful we really want to go home but we are afraid because the situation is still dangerous
7195987 our four hectare farm of corn and coconuts is waiting but our village is a hot spot we are still afraid to go home
7195988 how i wish peace will reign in our midst we are tired of being displaced
7195989 i feel it most when we eat together because the food on the table is not enough
7195990 so i decided to have ligation because life is hard
7195991 the general aim is to improve on your personal best break the philippine record if you can the sea games record and take it from there
7195992 besides just the excitement of the games being that close thats the kind of thing i think st louis would experience at a minimum
7195993 because thats part of the strategy of the games to involve other communities said bill scherr a board member of chicago 2016 and president of world sport chicago
7195994 with our ties to the olympics in 1904 and the soccer tradition in the city we think we have a good story to tell
7195995 anyone who thinks they know how to handicap a race like this is fooling themselves
7195996 but i think we have as good a shot as any of the cities right now and they have as good a shot as we do well work forward under that assumption
7195997 the games are going to be held right in the heart of the city
7195998 i think you have to be true to who you are and you have to be true to what works for you as a host
7195999 what worked in barcelona might not have worked in atlanta what worked in atlanta would not have worked in sydney so each games is unique each games is distinctive each games takes on its own character and flair
7196000 we would feel the same way if we werent bidding

7196051 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way im sorry if anybody took it the wrong way and thought it was offensive
7196052 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture

7196066 my dad boots adams started a basketball team at phillips oil in bartlesville okla
7196067 it worked out so well for him that i thought it would be a good idea to start a team here in houston
7196068 phillips 66 won games at the same rate that the globetrotters did
7196069 phillips cornered the market so they always had great teams
7196070 you had the peoria caterpillars the phillips 66ers the milwaukee allen bradleys the buchan bakers in seattle and the wichita vickers which had one of the biggest teams in the league with 7 3 swede halbrook and 7 0 don boldebuck a university of houston product
7196071 we didnt have big crowds at jeppesen fieldhouse but they were into it
7196072 the money was about the same as the nba we traveled first class by adams private plane and we had a job waiting for us
7196073 but if we werent traveling or at a ballgame we had to work
7196074 we were trying to establish ourselves as best we could so later on after wed finished playing basketball wed have a job
7196075 i wanted a steady job and the opportunity for a career
7196076 phillips petroleum gave me that opportunity the nibl offered you a career so the league was able to get some great players

7196089 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7196090 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7196091 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants

7196098 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need

7196100 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7196101 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7196102 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7196103 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7196104 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7196105 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7196106 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7196107 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7196108 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7196109 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7196110 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked

7196124 i have learned how to get along with a group that i may not like i can accomplish dreams if i just keep working at it
7196125 i am so proud and excited to be on space team it was fun
7196126 i have learned to never give up and keep trying we are all special in different ways
7196127 my year was awesome even though i did not realize there would be so many acronyms to remember
7196128 im proud and excited to be on the space team
7196129 space team will help us in the future because it provides us with lots of learning
7196130 we are only one of the few schools in the nation that has this program
7196131 thats one of those deals where i couldnt get by him and i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me and he has before so thats the way it goes
7196132 thats what happened its too bad we tore up the car a little bit after the race but i guess he wasnt happy about it and i can understand but in the back of my mind all i could think about was richmond in a nationwide race when he was trying to get through the field and he pile drove me thats just the way it is its just racing i have a lot of respect for the guy and he was real fast but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
7196133 he does that and hell always come back and say hes sorry
7196134 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now
7196135 they keep talking about rivalries we might have one now
7196136 cheating the bad things good nascar nextel cup racers do in pursuit of speed
7196137 this is not just my house this is your house i love you all
7196138 treating people well spoils them for being treated badly that is they become much less contented and willing to accept lower life conditions
7196139 i believe the idea that wellness can come from the experience of wellbeing
7196140 after this action the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth
7196141 whats a kid going to learn from someone who decided his best option in life was to become a teacher
7196142 youre a teacher susan be honest what do you make
7196143 i make kids work harder than they ever thought they could i make a c feel like the winner of the congressional medal of honor and an a feel like a slap in the face dont waste my time with anything less than your very best
7196144 i make kids sit through 40 minutes of study hall in absolute silence no you may not work in groups no you may not ask a question why wont i let you get a drink of water because youre not thirsty youre bored thats why
7196145 i make parents tremble in fear when i call home i hope i havent called at a bad time i just wanted to talk to you about something billy said today
7196146 i make them understand that if you have the brains and follow your heart if someone ever tries to judge you by what you make pay no attention because they just didnt learn

7196151 thats what we didnt do and thats a good learning lesson it was the kind of game where you couldnt afford a mistake at the back or at a set piece
7196152 i believe they wanted it a bit more than us in the first half and the corner when they scored shows that

7196158 house dick trevor bake says jet fuel and cards clear up not decoct
7196159 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7196160 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7196161 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7196162 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7196163 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7196164 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7196165 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7196166 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7196167 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations

7196170 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7196171 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7196172 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7196173 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7196174 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7196175 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7196182 our decision to leave the brand is based on the simple fact that to much of our marketing and reinvestment resources were going to an outside entity that was not making spending choices that we felt were in the best interest of our agents employees and customers one of many examples are the direct online relationships that we have established with the times globe wsj and courant tmg made this happen at our expense and effort so that our your listings can be marketed until sold on these very popular and expensive websites at not cost to our agents

7196205 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7196206 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond

7196212 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7196213 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes

7196215 the policies meet monthly mortgage costs should an accident sickness or unemployment occur and the unemployment criterion is generally interpreted as being made unemployed by your employer however those opting to leave their job because of circumstances beyond their control ie caring are also covered
7196216 over two million people start caring every year and i fear a number of them may have mppi but do not realise they can claim on their policy as a result theyre missing out and suffering financial hardship
7196217 whilst this isnt a long term solution it does provide a temporary mortgage repayment financial safety net in that first year and will help people keep their homes and give them time to sort out their finances
7196218 this type of cover could make a huge difference so its vital people check their policies the state isnt always going to hand out money insurers need to be more socially responsible and help where they can
7196219 given another chance at life they would do exactly what they were doing

7196243 he is a wunderkind who was sophisticated not only about raising money but the political process
7196244 i knew barack obama was going to be the next president
7196245 there was just something in my heart that really led me to believe that
7196246 my experience is there tends to be a correlation between positive ratings and academic achievement
7196247 its a very important piece of data that reflects the school
7196248 you no longer have to make an inference on what someone meant
7196249 for democrats its important that they frame the public understanding of obama favorably and make it stick in the minds of the public
7196250 obama is a newcomer kind of a work in progress there is some unease among a lot of swing voters they need to introduce obama and produce a simple compelling narrative that sticks in the minds of the public
7196251 even living here as long as i have i often have to sit and think about it for a minute which way do i want to go
7196252 some assumed that the inner beltline was i 440 and the outer beltline was i 540
7196253 there was a good percentage of folks who liked them and there was also a good percentage who thought it made it more confusing
7196254 i have a feeling that inner and outer is probably going to stay part of the conversation
7196255 theyre beautiful historic homes but its rare on a moving project that you have this many at the same time

7196274 you may have noticed that many of the paragraphs are quite short
7196275 its a world we better figure out because we cant ask our students to come into a classroom put those things aside and sit in a row and think were interesting
7196276 there has been a tendency to use technology as a substitute for curriculum
7196277 technique and how to ideas have taken the place of deciding what it is exactly we want these children to learn
7196278 but i have nothing against the technology if its in the service of grown ups facing their responsibilities to decide what the students need to know precisely if they did that these technical gadgets will be valuable
7196279 it gives kids a chance to use things they already use in real life and make that connection in school
7196280 we did have to take a hard line approach to that
7196281 you can restrict all kinds of stuff and you can drive yourself nuts trying to police all of it they culbreth are probably kind of opening themselves up to something
7196282 these teachers say this pilot signals their commitment to our students to meet them where they are as opposed to where the teachers are comfortable
7196283 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
7196284 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities
7196285 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
7196286 do these two sets have the same number of objects
7196287 thus basic numerical concepts do indeed appear to depend on an innate mechanism this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically
7196288 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
7196289 at worst theyre outright dangerous in stark contrast to claims made by the dutch research team and in the media we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
7196290 in fact our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously

7196294 every high school student in north carolina needs to talk to their guidance counselor today about enrolling in learn and earn so they can take free college courses reach their full potential and achieve their dreams
7196295 kay is an aggressive enthusiastic and dedicated leader committed to helping north carolina
7196296 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7196297 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7196298 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7196299 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7196300 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7196301 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7196302 obama has really caught the imagination of millions of people including thousands of people in our state
7196303 i am confident that most americans understand the importance of this years election
7196304 and many voters are trying to figure him out still making him more vulnerable to personal attack
7196305 i see him as a genuine american hero but i wasnt taken in by some of the reasons we went to war
7196306 if i did everything the same as everybody else i wouldnt be who i am
7196307 were really focusing on young people being involved in the electoral process
7196308 i think young people are finally realizing they have a voice in politics and they must use their voice
7196309 there are probably more first time delegates than weve ever had
7196310 a lot of it is just the number of new people who came into the process through sen obama
7196311 the campaign is making a major emphasis in north carolina
7196312 according to party rules we dont have a candidate until the votes are counted
7196313 once voters especially women voters are educated on the differences between mccain and obama theyll feel very strongly that their interests are best met when they vote for sen obama
7196314 thats kind of the kitchen table issue that affects most peoples lives directly
7196315 with gas prices and everything people are starting to see that the decisions made by their elected leaders have tangible effects on their day to day lives
7196316 agreed partition is the only option its just a matter of time before you to realize this fact

7196319 its never too late for your country to say that youve done a great job for us
7196320 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he barack obama is the presidency is not something that lends its self to on the job training

7196350 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7196351 i cannot tell you any spiritual truth that deep within you dont know already all i can do is remind you of what you have forgotten
7196352 the mind is a superb instrument if used rightly used wrongly however it becomes very destructive to put it more accurately it is not so much that you use your mind wrongly you usually dont use it at all it uses you
7196353 all the things that truly matter beauty love creativity joy inner peace arise from beyond the mind
7196354 all true artists whether they know it or not create from a place of no mind from inner stillness
7196355 emotion arises at the place where mind and body meet it is the bodys reaction to your mind or you might say a reflection of your mind in the body
7196356 it wasnt through the mind through thinking that the miracle that is life on earth or your body were created and are being sustained
7196357 you may not yet be able to bring your unconscious mind activity into awareness as thoughts but it will always be reflected in the body as an emotion and of this you can become aware
7196358 love joy and peace cannot flourish until you have freed yourself from mind dominance
7196359 pleasure is always derived from something outside you whereas joy arises from within
7196360 pain is inevitable as long as you are identified with your mind
7196361 nobodys life is entirely free of pain and sorrow isnt it a question of learning to live with them rather than trying to avoid them the greater part of human pain is unnecessary it is self created as long as the unobserved mind runs your life the pain that you create now is always some form of nonacceptance some form of unconscious resistance to what is on the level of thought the resistance is some form of judgment on the emotional level it is some form of negativity the intensity of the pain depends on the degree of resistance to the present moment and this in turn depends on how strongly you are identified with your mind
7196362 the psychological condition of fear is divorced from any concrete and true immediate danger it comes in many forms unease worry anxiety nervousness tension dread phobia and so on this kind of psychological fear is always of something that might happen not of something that is happening now
7196363 power over others is weakness disguised as strength true power if within and it is available to you now
7196364 the most common ego identifications have to do with possessions the work you do social status and recognition knowledge and education physical appearance special abilities relationships person and family history belief systems and often also political nationalistic racial religious and other collective identifications none of these is you
7196365 death is a stripping away of all that is not you
7196366 when you are present you can allow the mind to be as it is without getting entangled in it the mind in itself is a wonderful tool dysfunction sets in when you seek your self in it and mistake it for who you are
7196367 to be identified with your mind is to be trapped in time the compulsion to live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation
7196368 life is now there was never a time when your life was not now nor will there ever be
7196369 nothing ever happened in the past it happened in the now nothing will ever happen in the future it will happen in the now
7196370 the quality of your consciousness at this moment is what shapes the future which of course can only be experienced as the now
7196371 unease anxiety tension stress worry all forms of fear are cause by too much future and not enough presence guilt regret resentment grievances sadness bitterness and all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by too much past and not enough presence
7196372 to be free of time is to be free of the psychological need of past for your identity and future for your fulfillment
7196373 be at least as interested in what goes on inside you as what happens outside if you get the inside right the outside will fall into place
7196374 wherever you are be there totally if you find your here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy you have three options remove yourself from the situation change it or accept it totally
7196375 you cannot find yourself by going into the past you can find yourself by coming into the present
7196376 words in themselves are not important they are not the truth they only point to it
7196377 dont get stuck on the level of words a word is no more than a means to an end its an abstraction not unlike a signpost it points beyond itself
7196378 at the deepest level of being you are one with all that is
7196379 the ultimate purpose of the world lies not within the world but in the transcendence of the world
7196380 you find god the moment you realize that you dont need to seek god
7196381 relationships do not cause pain and unhappiness they bring out the pain and unhappiness that is already in you
7196382 as far as inner transformation is concerned there is nothing you can do about it you cannot transform yourself and you certainly cannot transform your partner or anybody else all you can do is create a space for transformation to happen for grace and love to enter
7196383 whenever anything negative happens to you there is a deep lesson concealed within it although you may not see it at the time
7196384 it seems that most people need to experience a great deal of suffering before they will relinquish resistance and accept before they will forgive
7196385 you must have failed deeply on some level or experienced some deep loss or pain to be drawn to the spiritual dimension or perhaps your very success became empty and meaningless and so turned out to be a failure
7196386 nothing out there will ever satisfy you except temporarily and superficially but you may need to experience many disappointments before you realize that truth
7196387 this books main purpose is not to add new information or beliefs to your mind or to try to convince you of anything but to bring about a shift in consciousness that is to say to awaken
7196388 only by awakening can you know the true meaning of that word
7196389 an essential part of the awakening is the recognition of the unawakened you the ego as it thinks speaks and acts as well as the recognition of the collectively conditioned mental processes that perpetuate the unawakened state
7196390 unless you know the basic mechanics behind the workings of the ego you wont recognize it and it will trick you into identifying with it again and again
7196391 trying to become a good or better human being sounds like a commendable and high minded thing to do yet it is an endeavor you cannot ultimately succeed in unless there is a shift in consciousness
7196392 you do not become good by trying to be good but by finding the goodness that is already within you and allowing that goodness to emerge but it can only emerge if something fundamental changes in your state of consciousness
7196393 all we can perceive experience think about is the surface layer of reality less than the tip on an iceberg underneath the surface appearance everything is not only connected with everything else but also with the source of all life out of which it came
7196394 when you dont cover up the world with words and labels a sense of the miraculous returns to your life
7196395 the quicker you are in attaching verbal or mental labels to things people or situations the more shallow and lifeless your reality becomes and the more deadened you become to reality
7196396 the unchecked striving for more for endless growth is a dysfunction and a disease it is the same dysfunction the cancerous cell manifests whose only goal is to multiply itself unaware that it is bringing about its own destruction by destroying the organism of which it is a part
7196397 as a spiritual practice i suggest that you investigate your relationship with the world of things through self observation
7196398 how do you let go of attachment to things dont even try its impossible attachment to things drops away by itself when you no longer seek to find yourself in them
7196399 no ego can last for long without the need for more therefore wanting keeps the ego alive much more than having the ego wants to want more than it wants to have and so the shallow satisfaction of having is always replaced by more wanting
7196400 wanting is structural so no amount of content can provide lasting fulfillment as long as that mental structure remains in place
7196401 no matter what you have or get you wont be happy you will always be looking for something else that promises greater fulfillment that promises to make your incomplete sense of self complete and fill that sense of lack you feel within
7196402 the content of the ego varies from person to person bu in every ego the same structure operates
7196403 nonreaction to the ego in others is one of the most effective ways not only of going beyond ego in yourself but also of dissolving the collective human ego but you can only be in a state of nonreaction if you can recognize someones behavior as coming from the ego as being an expression of the collective human dysfunction when you realize its not personal there is no longer a compulsion to react as if it were
7196404 all egoic motivations are self enhancement and self interest sometimes cleverly disguised even from the person in whom the ego operates
7196405 suffering has a noble purpose the evolution of consciousness and the burning up of the ego
7196406 accepting means you allow yourself to feel whatever it is you are feeling at that moment it is part of the isness of the now you cant argue with what is well you can but if you do you suffer
7196407 unconscious people and many remain unconscious trapped in their egos throughout their lives will quickly tell you who they are their name their occupation their personal history the shape or state of their body and whatever else they identify with others may appear to be more evolved because they think of themselves as an immortal soul or living spirit but do they really know themselves or have they just added some spiritual sounding concepts to the content of their mind knowing yourself goes far deeper than the adoption of a set of ideas or beliefs spiritual ideas and beliefs may at best be helpful pointers but in themselves they rarely have the power to dislodge the more firmly established core concepts of who you think you are which are part of the conditioning of the human mind knowing yourself deeply has nothing to do with whatever ideas are floating around in your mind knowing yourself is to be rooted in being instead of lost in your mind
7196408 i am tired of this mad world and peace is all i want
7196409 if peace is really what you want then you will choose peace if pace mattered to you more than anything else and if you truly knew yourself to be spirit rather than a little me you would remain nonreactive and absolutely alert when confronted with challenging people or situations you would immediately accept the situation and thus become one with it rather than separate yourself from it
7196410 if the thought of lack whether it be money recognition or love has become part of who you think you are you will always experience lack rather than acknowledge the good that is already in your life all you see is lack
7196411 there is the dream and there is the dreamer of the dream the dream is a short lived play of forms it is the world relatively real but not absolutely real then there is the dreamer the absolute reality in which the forms come and go the dreamer is not the person the person is part of the dream the dreamer is the substratum in which the dream appears that which makes the dream possible it is the absolute behind the relative the timeless behind time the consciousness in and behind form the dreamer is consciousness itself who you are
7196412 1 he didnt earn his wealth he married it 2 he and others are trying to paint obama as an elitest 3 hes even grossly ignorant about his own household economy 4 read my sig
7196413 1 yes they did 2 do you speak english 3 see 2 4 ask joe bob to find you a better gif
7196414 im not going to name the name i dont name names from anyone in that part of the world
7196415 i can say to you that my words that i give you are yours to feel to keep and to be loved by i hope that this blog helps create the warmth i feel within me
7196416 for democrats its important that they frame the public understanding of obama favorably and make it stick in the minds of the public
7196417 obama is a newcomer kind of a work in progress there is some unease among a lot of swing voters they need to introduce obama and produce a simple compelling narrative that sticks in the minds of the public
7196418 how can you be a leader of anything if you cant be a leader of your home
7196419 i walk the streets and people say please run as a write in
7196420 said davis publisher of the wrigley bulletin and news a community paper
7196421 if she cant take care of herself then how is she going to take care of other people while serving in congress
7196422 a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7196423 into the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics he once so deplored
7196424 hell have to figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit at
7196425 hes dynamic hes a great talker he goes the extra mile when he wants to jab the opponent
7196426 he brings to the ticket what obama is missing in a lot of dimensions especially foreign affairs
7196427 no choice of vice president can make barack obama more experienced
7196428 by choosing a man who has been one of his harshest critics on whether obama is ready to be president obama merely further exposes his own flaws
7196429 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7196430 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7196431 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class he has stared down dictators and spoken out for american cops and firefighters
7196432 its just what you can do and how hard you work
7196433 he is a wunderkind who was sophisticated not only about raising money but the political process
7196434 i knew barack obama was going to be the next president
7196435 there was just something in my heart that really led me to believe that
7196436 every high school student in north carolina needs to talk to their guidance counselor today about enrolling in learn and earn so they can take free college courses reach their full potential and achieve their dreams
7196437 kay is an aggressive enthusiastic and dedicated leader committed to helping north carolina
7196438 obama has really caught the imagination of millions of people including thousands of people in our state
7196439 i am confident that most americans understand the importance of this years election
7196440 and many voters are trying to figure him out still making him more vulnerable to personal attack
7196441 i see him as a genuine american hero but i wasnt taken in by some of the reasons we went to war
7196442 if i did everything the same as everybody else i wouldnt be who i am
7196443 were really focusing on young people being involved in the electoral process
7196444 i think young people are finally realizing they have a voice in politics and they must use their voice
7196445 there are probably more first time delegates than weve ever had
7196446 a lot of it is just the number of new people who came into the process through sen obama
7196447 the campaign is making a major emphasis in north carolina
7196448 according to party rules we dont have a candidate until the votes are counted
7196449 once voters especially women voters are educated on the differences between mccain and obama theyll feel very strongly that their interests are best met when they vote for sen obama
7196450 thats kind of the kitchen table issue that affects most peoples lives directly
7196451 with gas prices and everything people are starting to see that the decisions made by their elected leaders have tangible effects on their day to day lives
7196452 no me conformaba he arriesgado y volver a a hacerlo
7196453 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7196454 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7196455 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7196456 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7196457 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7196458 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7196459 change we need after eight years of failed policies that favored special interests at the expense of our families under george bush and john mccain
7196460 joe biden is the genuine article who has brought change to washington without being changed by washington
7196461 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11 i mean theres nothing else
7196462 lucinda right hand on the yellow rock the yellow rooock

7196466 i ate a cheeseburger deluxe with grilled onions the patty like a charred piece of edible gold like a meat sponge and had an order of onion rings done to perfection and perfectly round all of which was driven down by a milk shake so thick i would have had better luck wont go there
7196467 in science it often happens that scientists say you know thats a really good argument my position is mistaken and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again they really do it it doesnt happen as often as it should because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful but it happens every day i cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion
7196468 i do not think god exists due to the lack of evidence
7196469 deny tax credits to cdn films amp tv deemed offensive or not in the public interest

7196475 whatever jordan fall hand on go to hell at the defeat reciprocal juncture
7196476 we seem to be in a down cycle right now stuck in an age where technology is often more of a worry than a wonder
7196477 i remember talking with my dad about how you could spend your entire life reading books
7196478 it was a great freshman year but i had a lot of help my teammates created the chances i was just able to put them away
7196479 we dont talk about getting to postseason as much as we talk about playing our best soccer every day and continuing to improve throughout the whole year
7196480 we brought back a lot of players and have some really good freshman coming in i think were at a point where we should be the no 1 team in the conference i think it would be a letdown if we werent
7196481 we have 10 starters back but that doesnt mean theyve nailed down those starting spots this season
7196482 theres a lot of competition for playing time on this team i think some of these players are going to have to get used to not playing a full 90 minutes because we have so many players who could step in there this is as deep a team as any that has been here
7196483 i knew we had a great team when i first came up here
7196484 there was always a lot of talent on this team the challenge was just putting everything together and last year we figured that out
7196485 but montana state billings and spu will both be tough still i think we have to be the favorites
7196486 its amazing how thin that line is between two wins and 14 wins we really werent that far off and its the same with this team they could either continue to excel do great and go all the way or they could go the other direction we dont talk about our expectation as getting to the tournament we just try to get as good as we can each day
7196487 the weather was beautiful we had an overflow crowd tonight we had great stock and to have as many nationally ranked cowboys we had here weve established a pretty important rodeo
7196488 it is in my opinion a credit to our volunteers
7196489 we didnt really put enough of them out there to put pressure on eveland
7196490 youve got to give credit to the guys in sacramento
7196491 they found something in his delivery they thought would help and he threw something like 26 strike out of the first 30 pitches it was unbelievable
7196492 thats a testament to his competitiveness he kept us in there without being on top of his game
7196493 give my team a chance to win like i did today
7196494 if you can hold them down to two or three runs like he does quite often through five or six innings
7196495 were putting him in position to make plays and hes doing that
7196496 we need him to do that hes capable and he just keeps getting better
7196497 youve got to run really precise routes and create separation because guys are going to make better plays on the ball
7196498 weve been really thin at receiver because of the injuries so jared has gotten some opportunities
7196499 hes played well but even if we were healthy at receiver i think jared would still play
7196500 i just came out with the mind set to compete every day and if the opportunity to play comes about take advantage of it
7196501 hes a hard worker hes a competitor thats what you want
7196502 there are so many little techniques you have to learn the playbook is bigger and you have to stay up on it and youre still trying to remember the plays and all the things theyve been teaching you
7196503 if you mess up on a play you have to forget it because its over
7196504 as a freshman youre going to make mistakes and you have to let things go
7196505 weve lost only about 15 games of 130 weve played since fourth grade in aau basketball three of us have been together since fourth grade
7196506 i think we showed we can be pretty good if we work hard enough
7196507 but we picked it up and pulled through those ferndale kids were really tough
7196508 its really gone smoothly today were just hoping people will realize how much fun this is and come out and support it
7196509 great weather great attitudes great fun what more could you want
7196510 without question the most common concern was associated with the release of a non native wildlife species and the potential impact on native plants and animals
7196511 the five mile radius dispersal area believed to be the probable distance that released turkeys would traverse does overlap a significant portion of the acme valley bottomlands just to the west of van zandt dike
7196512 it is possible that even a small group of wild turkeys 10 12 birds could do substantial damage to these organic farm sites
7196513 in short we do not have any plans to release wild turkeys in whatcom county or elsewhere in northwestern washington at this time
7196514 i think the early success of the mens program does puts some pressure on the women
7196515 but so far everybody has been supportive they understand this is a first year program our hopes obviously are to build as consistent a team as the boys have become
7196516 our first challenge has been getting the word out that we even had a program
7196517 its kind of been a grass roots word of mouth process weve talked to a lot of local coaches and players but we found that most of the players of that age group were already travelling somewhere else to play finding local players has been really difficult for us this year
7196518 we have some players that can definitely step in and play the position and we have a line on a couple others and well hopefully convince one or two to come out
7196519 she cant wait to get back on the field competitively
7196520 she will definitely be one of our most effective offensive players shes fast shes strong and shes good with the ball
7196521 shes a really good ball handler and will be a team leader for us
7196522 we have got two or three offensive powerhouses who are going to score some goals for us but i think we are deeper defensively
7196523 everybody is coming in from all these different backgrounds and it will take us a while to have everybody find their role on this team but once we get a couple of games under our belt i expect us to start getting sharp we have some pretty talented individuals on this team once we start playing games i know we have enough firepower to be competitive with the other teams in this league
7196524 im relatively confident that were going to be contenders in the north
7196525 id be surprised if we dont win yeah we have a lot of new faces but i think were coming back with a deeper roster
7196526 his soccer mind is one of the best ive ever coached hell probably lead us in goals
7196527 almost everything that we will do is going to go through him he is going to be asked to hold down the middle and spread the ball around
7196528 he will play behind everybody and anchor what i feel will be one of the best defenses in the league
7196529 hes real strong in the air and doesnt give up too many opportunities
7196530 we had six guys try out for the spot and theyre all new well probably carry three through the season theres some young talent there and were just looking for that one guy who can step up and fill those hero shoes for us
7196531 i think well be more solid on defense than last year
7196532 we cant allow a lot of shots and we need to maintain possession losing abdulwali is big because he was our leading scorer and the north mvp so the question will be whether we can score at the same rate we did last year
7196533 but this team has so much talent and so much depth we are talented one through 20
7196534 the games that we lost we really werent completely out of
7196535 looking back we had our chances we just needed to be a little more consistent in our play we werent always as intense as we probably needed to be and i think well learn from that
7196536 we have some real proven leadership returning this season and that makes me more comfortable as a coach that kind of leadership will help us get through the ups and downs of the season
7196537 our defense during practice is as tough as any team we play against
7196538 they are just so solid we know we are going be in games because of that group
7196539 what we need to do is find a way to score more goals if our offense can find a way to do that well be in good shape
7196540 a lot of our attack will be determined by her performance and shes looked great in practice
7196541 we have to play better in the big games this season
7196542 our schedule is tougher this season and i think just the experience of playing in those games last season and talking about them is going to help this is going to be our most challenging season but what that does is give us more opportunity to have those big games
7196543 when they brought him in i knew he was a good punter every guy they have brought in here i have said it is a competition even if you are beating a guy out in camp there are guys all around the league who can do the job so it is always a competition that is how you have to treat your job at this level
7196544 if a guy breaks free i have to delay him but i dont want to go in full bore
7196545 i heard wide receiver logan payne talk about it recently
7196546 all i can do is control how i kick the ball he does the same and all we do is go out and perform it is not tense i am not rooting for him to shank a ball i want him to punt his best and if i win the job that means i punted better
7196547 then every once in a while ill send them indoors to reassure them that they can still kick
7196548 i came in hitting 55 or 60 yard punts and that is not all there is at this level
7196549 i felt like last year i understood it did i execute it every time
7196550 en un principio del juego se nos complicaron las cosas por que a pesar de que el equipo quiso proponer desde los primeros minutos el rival supo aprovechar dos errores que tuvimos para sorprendernos y tener la ventaja de dos goles sin embargo no se dej de luchar hasta el final por rescatar un mejor resultado y la muestra est en que alcanzamos a remontar el marcador que tiene un gran m rito obtener este triunfo
7196551 en el primero tiempo tuvimos muy poca posesi n de pelota lo que provoc darle espacios al rival esto quiere decir que debemos afinar
7196552 with all the right intentions we sat him longer than we should have
7196553 and it just seems that from that point on he hasnt been as sharp
7196554 i think sean is a guy who can approach that
7196555 weve earned a reputation for listening to our clients for working with them to design the perfect vehicle for their particular message for presenting clear and solid budgets and for sticking to them

7196559 we try to show our clients that when we work together the job is not only done right but its also exciting rewarding and a lot of fun

7196575 theres no filler here every concert is specifically about something and created for the space its in
7196576 its kind of an extraordinary thing to have a librettist write for two composers at the same time
7196577 but mark came up with ideas for each composer that they took on heartily
7196578 i dont know if he is our most important living american composer but hes my favorite living composer
7196579 he has the most chops of any composer he can write just about anything can write it quickly and can write in any style and when it is done it will sound like his music
7196580 he knows what it is to be on the stage play music and give something to an audience
7196581 everyone thinks they have to write the great american tragedy but people want to go to the theater to enjoy themselves sure they want to come away with a moral question thats been posed or to fall in love with a character or to have a personal catharsis and come out the other side these operas do all of that and they are musically challenging but they are funny and fun its the ultimate combination
7196582 this one comes from when i was studying blind contour work
7196583 elevate street art to an art form and give it an ethic
7196584 if putting up stickers and posters is considered vandalism petty at the least and if vandalism is garbage then man sure has left his mark with garbage all over the universe
7196585 they defy age limits these campy little characters that people like
7196586 and most people dont want to have to pay more than about 50 cents for a sticker
7196587 the kid who last night painted a wall in the city thats still drying this morning
7196588 i think we need to abolish the federal reserve and reinstate the gold standard
7196589 the u s government has to borrow money to finance its operations from chinese saudi and other foreign banks
7196590 therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes
7196591 we take it as it comes from now on its up to america to love us and vote for us and take us all the way
7196592 they cant define the difference between stripping in a strip club and the performance we do
7196593 in a strip club your main focus is getting out of your clothes as quickly as possible
7196594 its not just about getting naked its about the choreography
7196595 the choreography the staging everything is to support the theme
7196596 we can go down to what they call swimsuit attire
7196597 for burlesque style we add that little tidbit we place the pasties on top of the bras
7196598 under utah law we can get away with flesh colored bras
7196599 their children or families would see as much flesh if they went to a public pool
7196600 we were kind of sad that no one got to see our jewels because there were so many on that costume
7196601 ive seen this re emergence of burlesque and i thought it would be a great art form to bring to salt lake
7196602 right now this is purely a hobby because we love doing it
7196603 we know that we live in a very conservative state and we know that not everybody is going to accept what we do as an art form or a talent
7196604 if we can open up the minds of some of the people here to see that what were doing is not lewd or sexual if we can reach out to some of those people and change their minds that right there is still valuable
7196605 due to resource constraints we are targeting somewhere in 2016 time frame for a limited deployable system

7196607 storytelling is a marriage between the mind and the heart
7196608 weve become a visual culture and something is lost but when someone tells a story theres a special something that happens between the storyteller and the listener its a much deeper experience i wouldnt be doing this if there wasnt that special connection
7196609 storytelling has been compared to theater but to me its more like jazz
7196610 during a jazz show you start off with the same chart of music but theres lots of leeway to improvise play off the audience and have fun with it
7196611 the language of the technicom the technions original name can and should be the hebrew language

7196658 you need a great deal of computational power robustness and performance and it becomes possible because a configurable analog digital system has a power efficiency improvement of up to 10 000 times compared to an all digital system

7196661 one of the most dramatic moments she has seen with the yankees
7196662 thats how ive invested for the past 20 years and how ill invest for the next 20
7196663 ive had it on my mind since the end of the last game last season being on the same field with southern cal in scott stadium what a blast thats going to be
7196664 its a great chance for a lot of our teams to show the world what we can do
7196665 those are the kinds of games players sort of live for
7196666 rather than moan about it the best thing for the teams in the league to do is use it for motivation and make people forget
7196667 top to bottom the accs going to be better a lot better i think
7196668 but it goes in cycles too if you look around the league i think you see that quickness level getting back up there
7196669 quiz s no tenemos tampoco unos niveles de consumismo tan fuertes como en otras sociedades
7196670 el sol el coco el pescado el mar son cosas que hacen m s f cil ser pobre y feliz aqu en cartagena que en cualquier parte de colombia cambi a roma por cartagena

7196672 arise transcend thyself thou art man and the whole nature of man is to become more than himself
7196673 so do you want to go to the store with me
7196674 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7196675 i am astonished by the audacity to tell such lies about me
7196676 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7196677 no solemos adherir a casi ninguna campa a ecol gica
7196678 but only until ive saved up enough money to continue my mission

7196680 even living here as long as i have i often have to sit and think about it for a minute which way do i want to go
7196681 some assumed that the inner beltline was i 440 and the outer beltline was i 540
7196682 there was a good percentage of folks who liked them and there was also a good percentage who thought it made it more confusing
7196683 i have a feeling that inner and outer is probably going to stay part of the conversation
7196684 i said well you could have texted me more too
7196685 as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master this expresses my idea of democracy whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no democracy
7196686 if it were proved to me that in making war my ideal had a chance of being realized i would still say
7196687 we heard allegations in the media about the ages and we took that very seriously and we asked the international federation to organise an inquiry themselves
7196688 the eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the federation not the ioc but we considered it to be a very serious issue
7196689 the international federation requested all documents like family books and entries of schools and things like that and these have been received
7196690 at first sight everything seems okay however the fig wants to study them thoroughly because they are in chinese and then they will report to the ioc as soon as possible
7196691 always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc
7196692 i dont want to talk about this subject any more because those who know me they know that im 16
7196693 how can i do more explain more no matter what people say im still 16
7196694 at one point during the fiasco hawkins said he couldnt breathe
7196695 well unless youre getting something to drink we might as well head on out so i can show you where we are staying
7196696 okay well it better be nice and let me make one thing clear
7196697 i will not sleep in the same bed with you
7196698 of course there just futons so we could always scoot them together
7196699 now i want to know why you are here i thought you wanted to live a normal life as much as possible
7196700 i dont know it was boring not really having anyone to talk to its not like its easy to make friends now that i dont go to school or anything so i thought i would try to find you because youre nice to me
7196701 i shouldnt try to interfere so much with your work but seriously miki
7196702 well there was two but koharu needed a place to sleep
7196703 im an east end boy and im proud that its happening in london i was very proud to be involved in the first place bringing it back to england and to london its going to generate so much interest in sport and kids are already getting excited about it
7196704 we have seen what the chinese have done here and im sure we will better that without a doubt

7196707 he tried to warm up for this game but he was in too much pain its fantastic to win bronze this team has incredible heart
7196708 i tested it before the game but i knew it was going to be very difficult
7196709 i wasnt able to run i didnt try to be a hero i could have hurt the team
7196710 im extremely proud of what these guys have done its hard to find words its kind of emotional
7196711 i told myself to play like i did when i was a kid it was a very pleasing day
7196712 i got into a lot of bad habits the last couple of years and im working on them
7196713 what theyve done today is one of the best performances ive seen
7196714 winning bronze is not the same as going home empty handed so im extremely proud im very happy
7196715 hes a great player but weve got a lot of great players
7196716 as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master this expresses my idea of democracy whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no democracy

7196718 you see tears theyre tears of happiness though we came a long way this tournament
7196719 we knew coming in that we may never have this experience again so we are lucky that everything went well and we got what we wanted
7196720 i think he has played very well in the olympic tournament
7196721 hes played very well today as he normally does in his position and i knew that he could probably be the deciding factor
7196722 i think it the game had been played in another part of the day it would have been very different
7196723 we tried to make sure that we didnt get uptight just to play our own game
7196724 i think that there was a certain combination of being very grounded in who she was what she believed in but also a certain recklessness i think she was always searching for something she wasnt comfortable seeing her life confined to a certain box
7196725 if she saw animals being treated cruelly or children in the news or a sad movie or if she felt like she wasnt being understood in a conversation
7196726 she was very capable she went out on the back of a motorcycle and did rigorous fieldwork her research was responsible and penetrating she saw the heart of a problem and she knew whom to hold accountable
7196727 weve created stability for our kids in a way that my mom didnt do for us
7196728 my choosing to put down roots in chicago and marry a woman who is very rooted in one place probably indicates a desire for stability that maybe i was missing
7196729 before they kill you they sharpen the knife in front of you they are worse than butchers
7196730 hes not going to be able to placate the forces he has unleashed
7196731 the bottom line is that the taliban can do what they want in the tribal areas because the pakistani army is not going to come after them

7196751 but this son at least this son i know why he died he died so we could have a home for the jewish people in the land of israel and he has a grave here on mount herzl in jerusalem and that is not a reason to cry it is a reason to sing

7196764 if this is the rule ill turn my brim up before i go to the next shul
7196765 if you want to be moshiach you must be properly outfitted
7196766 no difference to me what i wear on my head
7196767 youre the moshiach just imagine that whoever heard of moshiach without a black hat
7196768 if you want to be moshiach and be accepted in this town put some pinches in your hat and turn that brim down
7196769 i guess my time hasnt come ill just have to return to where i came from
7196770 yes its very wonderful that you all learn torah but you seem to have forgotten a crucial part of our mesorah

7196797 the team is playing good and i need a rest so ill take a couple more days
7196798 the mets cant win em all and besides wally matthews figures theyre not trying
7196799 n o foi um jogo muito bom tivemos muitos erros n o conseguimos suportar a press o nos momentos dif ceis mas sa mos com a cabe a erguida volto com essa prata com muito orgulho o meu melhor eu fiz aqui dentro
7196800 a equipe norte americana fez um grande jogo hoje tentamos de tudo quanto foi jeito e n o deu vamos para a frente sa mos de cabe a erguida o time est de parab ns porque sempre uma medalha
7196801 ive had it on my mind since the end of the last game last season being on the same field with southern cal in scott stadium what a blast thats going to be
7196802 its a great chance for a lot of our teams to show the world what we can do
7196803 those are the kinds of games players sort of live for
7196804 rather than moan about it the best thing for the teams in the league to do is use it for motivation and make people forget
7196805 top to bottom the accs going to be better a lot better i think
7196806 but it goes in cycles too if you look around the league i think you see that quickness level getting back up there
7196807 i think the vast majority of the hillary folks did fall in love with hillary and now are certainly falling in line with obama
7196808 having said that theres going to be the largest gathering of press outside of beijing in denver this week with all of them on a hair trigger for the slightest sign of dissonance and conflict it has all the elements of a tinderbox environment
7196809 we know shes not going to win but this is extremely symbolic for me to cast a ballot for a woman for president
7196810 shes going to get maximum political mileage out of this
7196811 i know a lot of my strong women clinton supporters from south florida i dont think theyre quite as accepting as i am
7196812 but i havent found any one of them who wasnt going to vote for obama and doesnt want him to win
7196813 it doesnt do any good to come out of the convention with a split democratic party
7196814 i dont need you to tell me my opinion i know what i think about these issues ive been doing this for 35 years and nothing in this campaign will be new to me
7196815 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be one of the most significant events to occur in europe since the end of communism
7196816 over the last eight years he has been a powerful critic of the catastrophic bush mccain foreign policy and a voice for a new direction that takes the fight to the terrorists and ends the war in iraq responsibly
7196817 he has really established himself as one of the small handful of this countrys wise men on us foreign policy
7196818 i told him he was welcome to use them whenever he liked with or without attribution
7196819 to the best of my knowledge anything that is embarrassing about my past is pretty well public record
7196820 any of you who take a look at my life will not be able to conclude that i am not an honorable man
7196821 very few people deserve to be called an exemplar of anything but he deserves to be called an exemplar regarding his relationship with his family
7196822 im here for your kids im here for the cops and the firefighters the teachers and the line workers the folks whose lives are the measure of whether the american dream endures
7196823 he just explained to me that you reap what you sow which i believe
7196824 i explained to him thats why that happened that way thats it i have a lot of respect for him and the organization they do a really good job and i really look up to them so thats that
7196825 its nascars decision and their discretion he spun me out so i just you know got into him a little bit and let him know that i didnt appreciate the way he passed me and he retaliated and ended up spinning me out
7196826 nascar is smart at what they do they handle everything the right way
7196827 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in maguindanao province
7196828 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7196829 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7196830 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7196831 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice
7196832 the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all
7196833 the reason for the exhortation that the philippines needs to focus is two fold firstly the country is not large enough to compete against india and china on the basis of scale and so the country needs carefully to select its battles
7196834 secondly focus brings the ability to charge premium rates for skills that are rarer this means the philippines can avoid being dragged into a low wage low investment spiral
7196835 however the key will be to ensure that the open source businesses that are created develop high value assets rather than developing as low value services businesses
7196836 there is a danger that too many areas of focus emerge in the philippine ict economy meaning that it will become difficult to gain the depth of skills required to develop globally competitive business that can sustain premium rates as opposed to the low rate economy associated with much outsourcing and bpo activity
7196837 for all of the outsourcing activities there are skill requirements for language it management and customer service and the various elements of the philippine education system need to respond positively here
7196838 however the more specialist skills and the sheer number of different specialist skills that will be needed are likely to be more difficult to produce without significant support and investment from government in secondary tertiary and vocational education
7196839 to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states
7196840 how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because weve killed someone in cold blood on command
7196841 pseudonyms protect the bloggers and their relatives from terrorist attacks for example
7196842 a molehill quickly turns into a mountain and the content of blogs can quickly turn into a match ball for domestic politics
7196843 bloggers only have their personal views and often distribute half truths
7196844 okay forget the vetting you can be my v p
7196845 memo to the clinton supporters will you just get the hell over it already
7196846 i think they all worked hard and were committed and didnt give up anything easy
7196847 us womens cooking team wins 4th gold while giving pleasure to their husband who pays for everything while they stay home and take care of the children
7196848 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7196849 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7196850 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7196851 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7196852 just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water
7196853 i came here to try to show nick i have a bit of game and if i play well i have a great chance

7196863 this has been an unprecedented opportunity for western australia and they labor have wasted it
7196864 they have damaged the reputation of this state both nationally and internationally
7196865 if a liberal government is elected and i find myself as the premier of western australia education will be our highest priority
7196866 every child every boy and girl deserves the best possible education that we can provide for them
7196867 well its the launch of the western australian campaign thats precisely what its about
7196868 its about colin barnett and the liberal team in western australia making sure that they take it well and truly up to mr carpenter
7196869 no wonder the music is excellent because its played by talented and brilliant musicians
7196870 ive had it on my mind since the end of the last game last season being on the same field with southern cal in scott stadium what a blast thats going to be
7196871 its a great chance for a lot of our teams to show the world what we can do
7196872 those are the kinds of games players sort of live for
7196873 rather than moan about it the best thing for the teams in the league to do is use it for motivation and make people forget
7196874 top to bottom the accs going to be better a lot better i think
7196875 but it goes in cycles too if you look around the league i think you see that quickness level getting back up there
7196876 they were victims of fraud not co conspirators or perpetrators
7196877 if a grand jury of 25 jurors found us innocent what is it that compels a jury of 12 to find us guilty
7196878 we feel the answer is found in the fact that we were prevented from presenting any evidence and that i was denied appointment of counsel after exhausting all funds available to me because the cftc obtained a freeze on all my assets
7196879 ancient history it was a civil matter that was resolved many years ago
7196880 we dont look around and say is there anyone else we can charge too we take the case they bring to us to see if theres a reasonable expectation we can get a criminal conviction out of it
7196881 just because prosecutors get a referral doesnt mean they shouldnt do their own investigation weve had this case for seven years and were still scratching our heads we dont understand why the people who were found liable are going free and those who werent have been criminally prosecuted
7196882 weve got a couple of shoulders that look like they will impact on next week in berrick barnes and daniel vickerman theyre unlikely to be available
7196883 it wasnt an easy situation to go into but he certainly relished the opportunity hes been waiting for it hell be much better for it
7196884 the key now is can we back up and therell be many who would suggest we cant
7196885 the history would suggest that also but well get a great opportunity to do that this week and thats what well concentrate on
7196886 we know that we have to better next week but we want to be better and we want to back up because its something that we havent done
7196887 i think its a reflection on how much they guys gave to secure that victory and then also that our feet hopefully are planted on the ground
7196888 we know that this is a two match tour and were very happy with what we achieved today and rightly so but another challenge awaits us in seven days
7196889 its been commented on before the fact that with so many guys that havent got that baggage with us i think that helps
7196890 its easy sometimes when youre sitting behind the glass a long way away with a pen not to have any real sense of the games physicality deans said
7196891 i think sometimes looking through the tv screen and looking from a distance we dont have a sense of that the boys got up and met that reality
7196892 were close to earning gold leed certification but i think well probably end up with silver we have that one in the bag
7196893 were going to find ourselves with a more attractive building for tenants
7196894 its something more people want but its not a deal breaker at this point

7196951 the end of the cold war was supposed to usher in a new age in which the major powers would no longer dictate to their neighbours how to run their affairs will it continue to rely on coercion to achieve its imperial aims or is it willing to work within the emerging international system that values cooperation and consensus
7196952 when the soviet union collapsed the us and israel made a run at controlling russia and the former constituent parts of its empire
7196953 has made it clear over and over that it is prepared to obey international law and treaties it is the americans who have thrown international law and treaties into the trash can not the russians
7196954 the global community can demonstrate to the kremlin that there are costs for the blatant use of force on behalf of anachronistic imperial goals
7196955 the georgian offensive opened with an infantry assault against south ossetias capital tskhinvali after a preparatory artillery attack with fire support capabilities including target oriented and concentrated fire including a mortar barrage and launch of notoriously imprecise truck mounted grad multiple barreled rocket launchers
7196956 georgia a us ally whose troops have been trained by american soldiers launched a major offensive overnight friday heavy rocket and artillery fire pounded the provincial capital tskhinvali leaving much of the city in ruins

7196958 an independent georgia is critical to the international flow of oil
7196959 american foreign policy with its goal of ringing russia with us military bases is leading directly to nuclear war
7196960 the wests objective has to be a democratic russia that is a constructive participant in a global system based on respect for sovereignty law and democracy
7196961 a stridently nationalistic russia will not succeed in any effort to create a new empire in our post imperial age

7196981 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7196982 this election is going to be decisive definitely if anwar wins we will be one step closer to taking over the government
7196983 from our assessment we are leading we have to win big it will mean the people reject
7196984 it is un malay to make these allegations anwar has a family and he has five daughters
7196985 politics is one thing but you are shaming a family man i am afraid that if we go overboard in attacking him and accusing him of anti malay it will backfire we will lose votes we saw that happen in the march polls
7196986 letsrun com isnt a forum where persons discuss track and field and have open discussions it is a forum where persons americans mostly come up with conspiracy theories about any athlete or country that has dominated that isnt from america
7196987 the freedom to doubt is an important matter in the sciences and i believe in other fields it was born of a struggle it was a struggle to be premitted to doubt to be unsure doubt is not to be feared but welcomed as the possibilty of a new potential for human beings
7196988 the gene pool in jamaica is predisposed to producing powerful explosive athletes

7196993 an archer how queer ive not run across many of your sort this deep in the country why were you hiding boy
7196994 i once belonged to the grey river coven my former coven resides near the grey river at the very base of the eros mountain i have been outcast three years hence and now roam the land freely
7196995 we were playing he must not have liked the game i chose
7196996 i dont normally like to play with people your age
7196997 this is my home you are a guest so mind youre on your best behavior
7196998 there is a friend that i want to join us i cant get to her so i need you to do it for me but we still have a little time would you like to play
7196999 i do i havent heard much music out in the woods what can you do
7197000 the match was a little bit thrilling a lot of ups and downs from both of us but eventually i got my thoughts back and my rhythm i was really pumped up when i had to be and really enjoyed the moment in the end
7197001 it just helps me not to have any doubts in what i do and how im practicing and how am i improving and evolving
7197002 it brings me a little more self belief that im on the right way and that i just have to keep on going like this
7197003 i will feel the burden because with the forwards we have like carlos tevez who likes to drop in and thats his best position it would mean i would have to stay further forward
7197004 there has been a lot of talk about us bringing in another forward and hopefully we can do that to strengthen the team and that would help us spread things out
7197005 maybe we could change things for certain games but if a forward doesnt come in then i am sure we can deal with that
7197006 i dont know if i will have to score more well have to wait and see
7197007 obviously over the last two years we have spread the goals out amongst the team and as long as we continue to do that then i would see no problem
7197008 i dont think ill ever lose that aggression its something ive always had
7197009 if we are not winning the game and its not happening i get frustrated i like to win i dont like losing so if youre telling me thats wrong then i wont believe it im a team player i am not concerned about being selfish

7197015 we heard allegations in the media about the ages and we took that very seriously and we asked the international federation to organise an inquiry themselves
7197016 the eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the federation not the ioc but we considered it to be a very serious issue
7197017 the international federation requested all documents like family books and entries of schools and things like that and these have been received
7197018 at first sight everything seems okay however the fig wants to study them thoroughly because they are in chinese and then they will report to the ioc as soon as possible

7197021 you can see from this tournament how we need to upgrade the level of the judges
7197022 that experience is going to make this experience that much better
7197023 its unlikely that we will see another olympics of this scope and stature again
7197024 the international olympic committee themselves recognise that this is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
7197025 the stadium will be a very different concept to beijing
7197026 were talking about leaving a 25 000 seater all purpose stadium
7197027 the largest urban park created in europe for more than 150 years
7197028 a huge amount of our investment in the olympic park is for legacy we are cleaning up the land burying overhead power lines upgrading roads and railways and installing new energy infrastructure
7197029 a site of this scale and quality within a few minutes of a great city centre must be almost unprecedented
7197030 as an organisation we owe it to our athletes to provide the preparation they need to succeed
7197031 we will do everything we can to figure out what went wrong and to make sure it doesnt happen again
7197032 pure raw talent that has been properly nurtured were reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7197033 i feel this can be part of our growing pain
7197034 we are still a little baby but we are not asking for mercy
7197035 with your blessings we will overcome all the difficulties were going to show what the true taekwondo is down the road
7197036 if this is truly what taekwondo is about then maybe taekwondo shouldnt be in the olympics maybe they should fix it and then let it come back
7197037 there is a feeling that we wont survive the next vote we must present a pristine environment
7197038 the transparency of the refereeing and judging system is like never before
7197039 definitely it will be introduced in the 2012 london games
7197040 if you go back 12 months brand china was in tremendous difficulties with toxic toys and a number of other issues
7197041 chinas amazing haul of gold medals has mirrored its spectacular economic growth to signal to the world that china has truly arrived
7197042 from the grandeur of the opening ceremony to the self assured way chinese athletes expected to win in so many events china exceeded every expectation
7197043 companies like li ning that are looking to expand globally are going to use the olympics as a chance to do that
7197044 it wont do much to lift growth as the chinese economy is so huge
7197045 before the games people were anticipating a business boom in tourism benefiting hotels airlines and local restaurants
7197046 now its becoming clear that the impact wasnt all that big i dont think industries like that are likely to benefit greatly from one month of olympics and paralympics
7197047 analysing the one off macroeconomic impact or the economics of the games is not really an issue of such great importance
7197048 its hard and thats why barack is such a grateful man

7197055 first the slovak orchestra is much better than the beijing orchestra pictured above which suffers from shrill upper string sound
7197056 more to the point the beijing orchestra is using breiners ideas so blatantly that it would be accused of plagiarism if its arrangers submitted their orchestration as original work in any respectable conservatory it isnt just the rockets red glare breiners basic conception of the whole piece has been copied
7197057 we have not heard of naxos rights international breiners publisher which has apparently attempted to discuss the issue with the committee
7197058 all the anthems and songs used at the beijing games were orchestrated by chinese musicians
7197059 my arrangements of public domain anthems are actually original compositions from a legal point of view

7197077 what happened to the separation of church and state in pennsylvania
7197078 i investigated and found the sign was installed through the logo trust program we do not process or approve applications for their signs but i suspect the church likely met the requirements for an attraction due to the number of visitors for a variety of public functions

7197093 i want you to give this to your baby from me please
7197094 ive had it on my mind since the end of the last game last season being on the same field with southern cal in scott stadium what a blast thats going to be
7197095 its a great chance for a lot of our teams to show the world what we can do
7197096 those are the kinds of games players sort of live for
7197097 rather than moan about it the best thing for the teams in the league to do is use it for motivation and make people forget
7197098 top to bottom the accs going to be better a lot better i think
7197099 but it goes in cycles too if you look around the league i think you see that quickness level getting back up there
7197100 going 8 8 and 7 9 that doesnt cut it in this league
7197101 if you dont perform well youre looking to get run out extremely quick
7197102 his arm is healthy and we are going forward with business as usual
7197103 they were 0 2 last year they wanted coach tom coughlin gone so youve just got to go week to week and keep going and then look up at the end of the season it worked for them
7197104 we were going to throw the hail mary pass fish for something big and forget about the rest
7197105 as soon as he took his first jump i knew it was at least 800 pounds
7197106 all i was concentrating on was not losing the fish
7197107 he wanted everything perfect always so focused on the goal not saying that coach z isnt as competitive or intense but hes got a different way of going about it he can make a joke he can keep it a little bit light and people arent on pins and needles around him
7197108 the thing i try to impart to them is my encouragement to get better my enthusiasm to get better and then that i am very competitive
7197109 i want that to come through but i dont think it necessarily comes through with me jumping up and down acting like a big baby if something doesnt work but again i love to win thats why im always trying to attack
7197110 we are the best 400 meter guys in the world
7197111 when we got out here as a group we had one goal to get the gold
7197112 i felt strong and i could feel her kind of breaking down a bit
7197113 i didnt quite have the extra gear in the last 200
7197114 its always a little disappointing when all things dont come together but its the olympics so i cant complain
7197115 i feel like everything has been left out there in the last three years since ive taken this team over there have been a lot of questions could this team pull it together could i pull it together so for me its tremendous satisfaction not just to win a gold medal but to really win it with an exclamation point
7197116 she brings a calm to chaotic situations she helps stabilize things because shes so consistent
7197117 i needed to catch a break and he gave it to me
7197118 it was good right up until whatever lap that was where i made a mistake
7197119 it came out from underneath me there and i had to check up or i would have spun out
7197120 thats as bad of a points night as we could have
7197121 we just have to keep our heads up we know were good enough to go win this championship still
7197122 its good when you can be frustrated with second but we did give one away today when you look at it it was obvious
7197123 this season weve really risen toward the top and we compete week in and week out with the best in the series
7197124 that would make the basketball schedule look easy in comparison
7197125 if we could translate the same logic of basketball to football and the end result was a really meaningful competition absolutely wed be interested
7197126 you just cant predict what will happen five or 10 years down the road

7197130 that was a good idea its a good way to get people out they say it makes it a little easier to throw some sliders in the dirt and let them swing at them it was just an all around good day
7197131 i simplified my delivery so much it feels the same between the stretch and the windup
7197132 before there was a big difference i was almost confusing myself between the stretch and the windup
7197133 i was happy to see frank get a few hits

7197138 our speed of play was much better and our closing down spacing was much better on defense our final third attacking was more creative and we had more chances and went up 2 0 and had a good first half
7197139 all of the players showed energy especially the young guys
7197140 i saw some hungry guys who really want to play
7197141 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7197142 i came here to try to show nick i have a bit of game and if i play well i have a great chance
7197143 were extremely excited to have both of them join our program
7197144 at first they didnt know what to think but once they got there they liked it now theyre excited about it
7197145 its a nice area its a great place to raise a family obviously the sickles school offers excellent academics and good athletics
7197146 everyones a little bitter that we lost but we dont have anything to be disappointed about
7197147 we had to play the no 1 team in the world and we fought and we got a game off them and we actually could have taken them to five
7197148 were just thrilled its hard that it ends with a loss but we got a silver medal at the olympic games nothing that anyone on our team has ever gotten and its just been a wonderful experience
7197149 i came out here ready i came out here prepared i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7197150 nothing profits more than self esteem grounded on what is just and right
7197151 they put the clampers on us held us down and we lost our confidence
7197152 we just werent able to handle the heat they put us under
7197153 we put it all on the floor every game and left nothing for anyone else
7197154 we played the best the whole tournament and are deserving of the gold medal
7197155 i put on this uniform since i was in 11th grade and had wonderful opportunity to represent our country on the junior national team and then world championships and four olympics i didnt win these four medals alone i had so many players who had such an impact on me and now that ive become the oldest player i try to do the exact thing with sylvia fowles and candace parker the fact i won four golds shows the level of dominance ive been able to be participate in with so many great players
7197156 lisa is one person that a lot of us as veterans or newcomers we can all emulate her lifestyle and her game
7197157 she is a woman first a mother second a basketball player third when you can have all those entities tied into one and still be considered the best hands down to you she is successful on and off the court a great mother and a great player how much sweeter can it get for her
7197158 i always liked her because she was tall and had good moves when i first played with her i thought wow thats lisa leslie i was like a fan like can i take a picture and get an autograph i cant do that anymore shes my teammate its a very humbling experience now she has passed the torch to me and i have no choice but to run with it keep things going and make her proud of me
7197159 and if i dont cross the line in second i dont care if people are disqualified or not i didnt deserve a medal
7197160 its like our sport has been plagued with doping people cheating so any time a record is broken or a fast time is run people automatically assume that somebody is on drugs it takes away from the sport it makes me think that people dont believe in hard work anymore
7197161 you should walk off that mat with your soul gasping for air i walked off and i wasnt tired and if im not tired thats a problem wrestlers say that the most honest thing youll ever do after a match is go back to your room and look at yourself in the mirror i dont have to go that far to know this i dropped the ball today
7197162 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7197163 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7197164 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7197165 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving
7197166 you cant just put your fingertips on the pad you really have to push it we explained all this directly after the race to cavic and his coach
7197167 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7197168 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7197169 i cut a couple loose nothing tightened up after i let one go
7197170 we had the one day friday where it kind of came back thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better the treatment and stuff is definitely working
7197171 keep coming keep coming keep coming at bat after at bat at bat after at bat
7197172 youve got to be cold blooded to be in that situation and actually only focus on seeing the ball and staying in your zone
7197173 i knew he was a great pitcher with a great fastball
7197174 he throws real hard but i knew the situation with the bases loaded i was trying to get the runs in at the time
7197175 that was one of the toughest games for me in my career one of the toughest that ive lost
7197176 just being ahead like that and boom we lost it was just a tough game to swallow
7197177 amazing great job to be able to get to him in that inning and get to the bullpen it says a lot about how much our guys battled at bat for at bat
7197178 i was rushing through my delivery not a good tempo when i did get the groundballs that i needed they werent at people it just wasnt my day basically everything you dont want to do i did today
7197179 today he just seemed a little flat up in the zone
7197180 he made some mistakes and on top of that it seemed like every ball found a hole
7197181 it was probably the best pitch i threw all day
7197182 it was the only ball that was down he did a good job of hitting it
7197183 they scored runs for him early and he filled up the strike zone which is what youre supposed to do when you have a lead
7197184 its kind of cool that it was here in toronto where i started where i had number one
7197185 i dont know im not worried about that its a great personal accomplishment but my motivation is one reason and one reason only and thats to get to the playoffs and win the world series
7197186 i will take 15 wins and a world series and id be the happiest player in baseball
7197187 it was as hot today as it was in florida
7197188 at least as humid it was sticky out there but i felt like i got stronger as the game went on
7197189 outside of brandon webb there arent too many people pitching better than he is
7197190 i know he set a personal best but he is not satisfied he is one of those guys that has busted his tail to put himself in this position hes been just unbelievable for us
7197191 the games going to teach him what he has to do
7197192 hes going to adjust and then he wont be here
7197193 anytime your name is with someone like gehrig and ruth its pretty special
7197194 to be quite honest with you i dont even think about it much because were trying to win games here thats something you reflect on maybe when your careers over
7197195 when you think about derek jeter hes been consistent through his whole career
7197196 he stayed healthy plays every day works very hard at what he does there arent a lot of people who have 2 500 hits shows you what kind of player he is
7197197 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
7197198 les participants viennent dune autre culture pour beaucoup ce sont des jeunes des banlieues
7197199 lind cence de nicolas sarkozy qui devant les d pouilles de jeunes de 20 ans parle de lui et de la solitude dun chef detat cest invraisemblable
7197200 nous proposons toute la gauche de se voir au plus t t pour faire une manifestation et r clamer le retrait des troupes fran aises dafghanistan

7197202 un retrait imm diat des troupes fran aises et des troupes de lotan
7197203 its a no for me its a no for me its a no for me
7197204 were going to psych you out until youre almost crying and then mary will scream youre going to vegas
7197205 producers had spent the hour introducing us to the top 20 seriously i am more than mildly obsessed with this show i
7197206 whos better than these dancers we havent seen anyone better than these dancers
7197207 then why didnt you just pick someone ou knew was good
7197208 lets get one thing straight here theyre applauding you because youre fat and could do that
7197209 you never should have tried out in the first place
7197210 viens je tinvite chez moi je te fait un ptit caf
7197211 youre big and wild and crazy and i love it but i think youre going to crash and burn with choreography
7197212 i do not in my head want to think that it can get any worse
7197213 it has hit people in terms of their pocketbooks and what else they can do
7197214 eventually people will get over the shock of gas prices and things that have happened with housing as with anything it becomes old news
7197215 im also a pastor to some degree im in the optimism business
7197216 when a guest breaks something they are responsible for replacing it no matter what it is
7197217 he could be thinking that its your responsibility since you asked him to do it
7197218 he may turn you down and refuse to pay and in the process jeopardize the friendship its a risk
7197219 what would you think if i sang out of tune
7197220 were you last in line the day they handed out rhythm thats no problem for wii music where the only thing you have to do to rock is flail
7197221 waiter rant thanks for the tip confessions of a cynical waiter
7197222 that wont even buy you a starbucks cup of coffee but all those dollars add up for the waiters as their primary source of income
7197223 if i have some truly abusive waiter i would just give the tip the 20 percent to the busboy then i would tell the manager why i didnt give it to the waiter but that would be the ultimate scenario
7197224 weve been really lucky that the rest of the year has been good
7197225 but for a few weeks this summer youre using your credit cards a little more often than youd like to
7197226 the economy and food costs are the top challenges the industry is facing but that means there are lots of subtle adjustments
7197227 id have more good days in a row before waiting tables i dont have as many now
7197228 like 20 every day no matter what you make you put that aside
7197229 gas and groceries also went up and a lot of us are students
7197230 its just not so easy to keep it up all the time
7197231 eventually sometimes they get you like andy got me this year or james got me this year and fernando gonzalez at the end of last year
7197232 these guys all play good tennis so when it all doesnt come together and maybe i just dont play my very very best its obviously not enough
7197233 we are firm about not having the champions trophy relocated
7197234 but we are expecting the icc to postpone and reschedule it for a later date
7197235 our government is also clear that if the tournament is postponed it will help us to convince these countries that it is safe to play in pakistan and the event must be held in pakistan at a later date
7197236 vull ser el primer michael phelps no el segon mark spitz
7197237 volia fer alguna cosa en aquest esport que ning hagu s fet abans
7197238 we had the one day friday where it kind of came back thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better the treatment and stuff is definitely working
7197239 anytime your name is with someone like gehrig and ruth its pretty special
7197240 ladies and gentlemen my wife jill who youll meet soon is drop dead gorgeous
7197241 she also has her doctorate degree which is a problem but all kidding aside
7197242 there are 18 million clinton supporters that they need to win over
7197243 its an unfortunate comment its certainly not going to win over any of those women
7197244 you are not sit down i cant believe youre doing this
7197245 i know the past couple months havent been easy but im excited for you and i actually hope you see this through for awhile i didnt think you were really willing to take the chance to do it yourself but im glad you are because it makes me proud that youre starting to do what i know you are capable of if i had it to do over again i think i would have liked to work for myself too
7197246 something i dont have cant possible burn in a place that doesnt exist for a nonsensical period of time
7197247 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7197248 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7197249 something i dont have cant possible burn in a place that doesnt exist for a nonsensical period of time
7197250 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7197251 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7197252 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7197253 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7197254 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7197255 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7197256 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7197257 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7197258 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7197259 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7197260 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7197261 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7197262 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
7197263 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7197264 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7197265 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7197266 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7197267 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7197268 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7197269 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7197270 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7197271 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7197272 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7197273 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7197274 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7197275 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7197276 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7197277 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7197278 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7197279 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7197280 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7197281 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7197282 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7197283 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7197284 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7197285 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7197286 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7197287 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7197288 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7197289 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7197290 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7197291 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7197292 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7197293 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7197294 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7197295 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7197296 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7197297 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7197298 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

7197300 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7197301 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7197302 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7197303 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7197304 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7197305 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7197306 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
7197307 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
7197308 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
7197309 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
7197310 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
7197311 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
7197312 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7197313 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7197314 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7197315 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
7197316 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
7197317 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
7197318 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7197319 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7197320 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7197321 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7197322 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
7197323 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
7197324 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7197325 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7197326 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7197327 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7197328 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7197329 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

7197348 a swim on part in the goldfish bowl a memoir
7197349 the contrast was all the more striking because until that point shed always had a memory like a website
7197350 from the fateful day of our lunch tell tale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7197351 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7197352 it might be something innocuous such as what time is my car coming or when am i going to the hairdresser but the fact she needed to repeat them opened a new and frightening chapter in our lives
7197353 i had to learn to be patient a quality i admit is in short supply i also had to learn she had an illness and that it wasnt personal
7197354 thats the worst thing about dementia it gets you every time
7197355 sufferers look and act the same but beneath the familiar exterior something quite different is going on theyre in another world and you cannot enter
7197356 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7197357 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7197358 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7197359 as if her dementia had sharpened her powers of long term recall
7197360 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7197361 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7197362 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7197363 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7197364 try to use that word or those words more often
7197365 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7197366 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7197367 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7197368 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7197369 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7197370 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7197371 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7197372 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7197373 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7197374 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7197375 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7197376 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7197377 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7197378 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7197379 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them

7197381 other evils there are that may come yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set uprooting the evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
7197382 we take it as it comes from now on its up to america to love us and vote for us and take us all the way
7197383 they cant define the difference between stripping in a strip club and the performance we do
7197384 in a strip club your main focus is getting out of your clothes as quickly as possible
7197385 its not just about getting naked its about the choreography
7197386 the choreography the staging everything is to support the theme
7197387 we can go down to what they call swimsuit attire
7197388 for burlesque style we add that little tidbit we place the pasties on top of the bras
7197389 under utah law we can get away with flesh colored bras
7197390 their children or families would see as much flesh if they went to a public pool
7197391 we were kind of sad that no one got to see our jewels because there were so many on that costume
7197392 ive seen this re emergence of burlesque and i thought it would be a great art form to bring to salt lake
7197393 right now this is purely a hobby because we love doing it
7197394 we know that we live in a very conservative state and we know that not everybody is going to accept what we do as an art form or a talent
7197395 if we can open up the minds of some of the people here to see that what were doing is not lewd or sexual if we can reach out to some of those people and change their minds that right there is still valuable
7197396 theres no filler here every concert is specifically about something and created for the space its in
7197397 its kind of an extraordinary thing to have a librettist write for two composers at the same time
7197398 but mark came up with ideas for each composer that they took on heartily
7197399 i dont know if he is our most important living american composer but hes my favorite living composer
7197400 he has the most chops of any composer he can write just about anything can write it quickly and can write in any style and when it is done it will sound like his music
7197401 he knows what it is to be on the stage play music and give something to an audience
7197402 everyone thinks they have to write the great american tragedy but people want to go to the theater to enjoy themselves sure they want to come away with a moral question thats been posed or to fall in love with a character or to have a personal catharsis and come out the other side these operas do all of that and they are musically challenging but they are funny and fun its the ultimate combination

7197410 storytelling is a marriage between the mind and the heart
7197411 weve become a visual culture and something is lost but when someone tells a story theres a special something that happens between the storyteller and the listener its a much deeper experience i wouldnt be doing this if there wasnt that special connection
7197412 storytelling has been compared to theater but to me its more like jazz
7197413 during a jazz show you start off with the same chart of music but theres lots of leeway to improvise play off the audience and have fun with it

7197431 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7197432 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7197433 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7197434 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7197435 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7197436 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7197437 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7197438 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7197439 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7197440 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7197441 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7197442 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7197443 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7197444 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7197445 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7197446 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7197447 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7197448 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7197449 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7197450 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7197451 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7197452 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7197453 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7197454 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7197455 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

7197457 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7197458 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7197459 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7197460 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7197461 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7197462 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7197463 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7197464 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7197465 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7197466 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7197467 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7197468 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7197469 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7197470 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7197471 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7197472 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7197473 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7197474 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7197475 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

7197487 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7197488 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7197489 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7197490 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7197491 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7197492 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7197493 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7197494 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7197495 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7197496 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7197497 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7197498 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

7197500 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7197501 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7197502 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7197503 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7197504 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7197505 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7197506 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7197507 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7197508 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

7197530 john mccain is certainly well known and has a history of trying to end wasteful government
7197531 barack obama is untested right now youre looking at the mood shift
7197532 they dont know much about him they think they know mccain
7197533 the election isnt a regional election its a state by state election mccains improvement is really republicans coming home
7197534 the economy far outweighs any other issue in this election
7197535 he has to really push that issue its the same way bill clinton won in 92
7197536 theres a believability that john mccain can help with the economy
7197537 i kept the television off and didnt discuss war with the kids around if they had questions or worries i reminded them that he was going to be as safe as possible and that it was our job to pray for all the soldiers not just daddy i set up individual e mail accounts for each child as they got older but dad was the only one who e mailed them they loved that they always got to talk to him individually whenever he called and as long as it wasnt a school night id wake them even if he called late it was worth the loss of a few minutes of sleep
7197538 consider having daddy say goodbye to the kids at home and then you and only you go with him to the airport its very tough on kids when they see mommy and daddy crying
7197539 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7197540 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7197541 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7197542 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7197543 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7197544 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7197545 enormous dissatisfaction with the republican party has brought out the base more
7197546 the rise of the internet and bloggers has made the party more progressive
7197547 the whole world changes and people feel a little bit at sea and they need help
7197548 i used to go around trusting everyone you cant trust a lot of people now
7197549 when you have a piece of metal that pierces your body like that at that age its going to have a problematic effect
7197550 what happens earlier in life has a potentially bigger effect on what happens later
7197551 the way in which we cope with danger is that we try to find differences between ourselves and the unfortunate person
7197552 when it happens to somebody completely out of the blue whos not doing anything risky it makes it harder to separate ourselves
7197553 if one was on the couch the other was on the couch and if one was upstairs so was the other
7197554 we dont reflect on what happened we reflect on what did not happen
7197555 if we reflect on the incident we wont get past it
7197556 collect all of your school books and then put them down your dog will initially think that you are going to leave only to find that you were staying home

7197562 times change peoples needs change this is not a museum even in a museum they change out the artwork

7197565 we are a commercial society and i think our society is reflected on the walls of the airport
7197566 atlanta is the most laissez faire city in the most laissez faire country
7197567 but this is one more way we are losing our individuality
7197568 its very discouraging that they would take something down after an agreement was made that it would be permanent

7197571 what happened to the separation of church and state in pennsylvania
7197572 i investigated and found the sign was installed through the logo trust program we do not process or approve applications for their signs but i suspect the church likely met the requirements for an attraction due to the number of visitors for a variety of public functions
7197573 a rapidly growing nondenominational protestant church of approximately 1 000 households
7197574 why do they make the trucks get in the left lane
7197575 ive seen this on the pennsylvania turnpike as well and thought there must be a reasonable explanation
7197576 it was 11 30 a m when we ran into the backup
7197577 fortunately we had just gotten gas because we sat in traffic for over nine hours to cover what turned out to be 14 miles to add insult to injury the bay bridge authority continued to collect the 2 50 toll instead of waving traffic through and clearing the miles of backed up traffic
7197578 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that
7197579 i am determined to work with the football associations and the olympic committee to ensure that when we come to 2012 we have a mens football team and we have a womens football team playing
7197580 this is a spectacular own goal for brown he is out of touch with the overwhelming views of football supporters throughout the uk
7197581 all the national supporters groups oppose this move and see it as a threat to the status of their nations to field independent football squads
7197582 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training

7197616 as a generation we are extremely privileged to have such heritage on our doorsteps be it our landscapes buildings museums flora or fauna but we also have a responsibility to ensure its survival for future generations

7197626 ya abal hasan amal yang paling utama di bulan ini adalah menjaga diri dari apa yang diharamkan allah
7197627 barangsiapa mendekatkan diri kepada allah dengan suatu pekerjaan kebajikan di dalamnya samalah dia dengan orang yang menunaikan suatu fardhu di dalam bulan yang lain
7197628 ramadhan itu adalah bulan sabar sedangkan sabar itu adalah pahalanya surga ramadhan itu adalah bulan memberi pertolongan syahrul muwasah dan bulan allah memberikan rizqi kepada mukmin di dalamnya
7197629 barangsiapa memberikan makanan berbuka seseorang yang berpuasa adalah yang demikian itu merupakan pengampunan bagi dosanya dan kemerdekaan dirinya dari neraka orang yang memberikan makanan itu memperoleh pahala seperti orang yang berpuasa tanpa sedikitpun berkurang

7197631 oleh karena itu banyakkanlah yang empat perkara di bulan ramadhan dua perkara untuk mendatangkan keridhaan tuhanmu dan dua perkara lagi kamu sangat menghajatinya

7197642 is your sales team trained learn how to excel at retail sales this two part workshop
7197643 if hes available well play him but i cant say hes available ive got no idea
7197644 hes one of our best players and knowing what he knows and who hes going to draw well weigh it up
7197645 were not going to expose players who arent right but if its an anthony rocca whos coming off a long term injury and hes available to play well then thats one of the things youd be pretty silly not to do
7197646 i am not about to get involved in how bad or how incidental it is we will judge it through the week
7197647 it is a very competitive market its a lot different to melbourne
7197648 those decisions will be made at the end of the year in terms of how many changes you can make to your list and where that takes you
7197649 brisbane and coach leigh matthews have done a similar job up there theyve remained competitive since their four grand finals 2001 04
7197650 were the two teams in those northern states where its very hard to bottom out but those decisions will be made at the end of the season
7197651 the last couple of weeks if you had asked me that i would have said i cant wait till its over ive mixed feelings
7197652 its obviously been a long association and i have had some fantastic times
7197653 this year has been a nightmare but i guess if you put it in with all the great times ive had then its not so bad
7197654 but this year has been extremely frustrating and disappointing its nobodys fault its just one of those things that happens in sport all the time
7197655 i thought jamal idris made a terrific debut he showed hes a good first grader of the future
7197656 his first 20 minutes was fantastic the pace of it caught up with him a little bit i think and he started cramping 15 to 20 minutes into the second half
7197657 but he certainly showed his strength and his speed and he can certainly jump and catch the ball
7197658 whether he stays there in first grade or not its hard to say but certainly on that performance you would think he would be there next week
7197659 he played well i thought he handled the step up pretty good and he was a handful
7197660 i thought they played particularly well probably the best theyve played for a long time
7197661 its going to be a real tough couple of weeks
7197662 i think we are going to have to lift it up a peg the next couple of weeks and really get it going
7197663 i think weve still got to lift a bit more
7197664 we are on a bit of a roll the enthusiasm is there and the excitement is there when you are winning
7197665 we are still not at our best but we are doing enough to win games
7197666 with the dragons next week weve had a couple of close games with them already in the last couple of years so we are expecting another tight one
7197667 we know weve got work to do and we spoke after the game about the fact that the standards and the stakes increase again next week
7197668 i think its a matter of how we finish the year where we can put ourselves and take it from there
7197669 i dont think we are thinking too far down the track we know the next fortnight will determine if we get there and where we finish
7197670 once that is sorted out we can reassess after that
7197671 they can score a lot of points and theyve got a lot of ball runners in their side and brett finch is obviously an origin halfback theyve got him steering them around
7197672 we are certainly playing a lot more for each other a lot more unselfish play and people working off the footy for other people and our goal line defence has improved out of sight
7197673 dos medallas de plata no se consiguen todos los d as
7197674 quiero la medalla pero estar satisfecho si rindo al m ximo
7197675 quer a hacer algo en este deporte que nadie hubiese hecho antes
7197676 es la despedida so ada es perfecto estoy en una nube
7197677 we have said it from the beginning that the opposition pact is actually fragile while it tries to topple the barisan nasional bn it is just an electoral pact and not a solid pact to be an alternative to bn
7197678 malaysia is a country which upholds its constitution so whatever policy is to be drawn up it must be in line with the constitution
7197679 the federal constitution has stipulated islam as the countrys official religion while the other races are free to practise their own religions
7197680 now he is so obsessed with becoming prime minister that he is prepared to conspire with dap in making a stand even if it could have a negative impact on the countrys politics
7197681 i hope the authorities especially the police are fully prepared to face this kind of situation which could heighten tension if not nipped in time
7197682 the campaign period until tomorrow is a critical one for the bn machinery which needs to work really hard until the last moments despite the disruptive attempts
7197683 we hope all voters will turn out to cast their votes since polling day
7197684 we also request all factories to assist their workers in permatang pauh to carry out their duties to determine not only their choice of wakil rakyat but also decide the destiny of the country
7197685 uh lindsay lohan why dont you drive on your side of the road
7197686 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7197687 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7197688 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7197689 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7197690 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7197691 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7197692 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7197693 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7197694 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7197695 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7197696 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7197697 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7197698 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7197699 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7197700 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7197701 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7197702 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7197703 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7197704 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7197705 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7197706 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7197707 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7197708 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7197709 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7197710 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7197711 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7197712 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7197713 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7197714 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7197715 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7197716 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7197717 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7197718 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7197719 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7197720 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7197721 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7197722 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7197723 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7197724 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7197725 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7197726 uh lindsay lohan why dont you drive on your side of the road
7197727 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7197728 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7197729 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7197730 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7197731 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7197732 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7197733 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7197734 this is a planning took where all things are going
7197735 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7197736 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7197737 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7197738 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7197739 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7197740 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7197741 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7197742 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7197743 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7197744 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7197745 well take our voices with our hands well make like knives well make demands im burning bridges for the last time im breaking habits for the first time i saw my future today it said im going away and i still havent sung the last line on my way down im not ready to lay im not ready to fade im not ready to die
7197746 rap music was a government ploy to convince black people to kill each other and keep them in the ghetto
7197747 i think at the moment i am going for john mccain
7197748 the question of this election is race the answer we are looking for is how much will it matter
7197749 it is hard to overstate the historic nature of this speech
7197750 my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character
7197751 this is a daunting task as the first black candidate for president to get there hes got to win roughly the same proportion of democrats and democratic leaning independents that all other democrats get if he doesnt hes in a world of trouble he cant win it just by changing the electorate
7197752 it has not been too much of an issue so far or at least not talked about but that is not going to last
7197753 i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
7197754 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
7197755 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally american in his thinking and his values
7197756 it is becoming clearer that he is the wrong candidate at the wrong time
7197757 this is tricky he wants to leave the convention with the party as united as possible
7197758 rap music was a government ploy to convince black people to kill each other and keep them in the ghetto
7197759 according to the u s committee for human rights in north korea there exists a vast network of structured institutions for punishment in north korea including
7197760 prisoners are brutally treated in these institutions with testimonies from north korean defectors describing torture hard labor starvation forced abortions infanticide families of up to three generations imprisoned detention without judicial process public executions chemical and medical experimentation on prisoners and gas chambers resulting in thousands of deaths comparisons have been frequently made to the nazi concentration camps
7197761 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7197762 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7197763 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7197764 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7197765 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7197766 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7197767 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7197768 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7197769 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7197770 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7197771 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7197772 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7197773 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7197774 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7197775 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7197776 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7197777 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7197778 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7197779 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7197780 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7197781 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7197782 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7197783 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

7197833 from time to time rumors circulate that thimerosal a mercury based preservative once used in several vaccines and still used in some flu vaccine could contribute to asds however valid scientific studies have shown there is no link the american academy of pediatrics aap the american medical association ama the cdc and the institute of medicine iom agree that science does not support a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism
7197834 the author concludes that recent studies have found no association between mmr vaccination and autism the frequent embryologic neuroanatomic abnormalities found in children with autism lessen the likelihood that mmr immunization is a major risk factor the immunization safety review committee of the institute of medicine and a special american academy of pediatrics panel have concluded that evidence does not support mmr immunization as a risk factor for autism
7197835 on may 18th 2004 the institute of medicine iom released its eighth and final report from its immunization safety review committee based on a thorough review of clinical and epidemiological studies neither the mercury based vaccine preservative thimerosal nor the measles mumps rubella mmr vaccine are associated with autism says the new report furthermore the hypotheses regarding how the mmr vaccine and thimerosal could trigger autism lack supporting evidence and are theoretical only further research to find the cause of autism should be directed toward other lines of inquiry that are supported by current knowledge and evidence and offer more promise for providing an answer said the committee that wrote the report the american medical association ama lauds the process that went into the creation of this scientific report and applauds the iom and the cdc for their strong efforts in continuing to ensure the safety of the vaccines that are administered in the united states through post market surveillance and studies such as this
7197836 some people believe increased exposure to thimerosal from the addition of important new vaccines recommended for children explains the higher prevalence in recent years
7197837 the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal containing vaccines and autism
7197838 there is much debate regarding the correlation of childhood vaccines and the occurrence of autism in children the weight of currently available scientific evidence does not support the hypothesis that vaccines cause autism we recognize there is considerable public interest in this issue

7197911 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7197912 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7197913 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7197914 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7197915 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7197916 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7197917 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7197918 but youve got to have some standards were not animals

7197921 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing

7197924 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely

7197926 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7197927 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7197928 try to use that word or those words more often
7197929 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7197930 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7197931 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7197932 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7197933 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7197934 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7197935 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7197936 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7197937 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7197938 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others

7197944 while i cant say its recession proof the performance of the video game industry in the last few years in light of difficult economic conditions speaks for itself
7197945 largest most robust cycle in history lazard capital markets analyst colin sebastian wrote in a report to investment clients earlier this year
7197946 probably more than any other medium video games are the best value for the money
7197947 computer and video games are a mainstream entertainment form which captures the imagination of every segment of our society
7197948 you have games that are rivaling film not only in sales but also in excitement for an art form games are now at a high level of photo realism
7197949 the wii is family oriented gaming they can make the investment and the whole family can share in the entertainment experience if it was just an individual shooter game it wouldnt have as much impact on the family entertainment dollar
7197950 theres much more supply of the product it used to be very difficult to get and its at a price point thats very attractive
7197951 if we get a steady rain over a couple of days i think well be ok
7197952 but if its a deluge then the rivers could flood until fay goes to never never land dont rule her out
7197953 we are concerned about the safety of people in low lying areas especially those in trailers and cottages that may be in the flood plain
7197954 a flash flood watch is in effect through monday evening for much of southeastern louisiana
7197955 heavy rain is still going to be a threat on the north shore including st tammany washington and tangipahoa parishes
7197956 it looks like rain but nothing like weve seen in florida
7197957 we are looking at six to 10 inches of rain falling on lauderdale county in that period of time
7197958 we possibly could get more if the remnants of fay follow one of the scenarios outlined by the national weather service
7197959 if that happens then we will see the southern rain band impact our area
7197960 in this scenario we could exceed even the 10 inches we are forecast to receive thats a great deal of rain for our area and residents will have to be mindful that flooding may become a real problem
7197961 dont try to cross roads that have water flowing over them
7197962 you cant rule out tornadoes in any kind of weather event during this time of year
7197963 we are having flooding issues in the county right now and the yankeetown and inglis area get it historically because of the drainage pattern in levy county where god wants the water to go out to the gulf of mexico
7197964 we are moving assets to inglis area to make sure we meet the needs
7197965 i havent heard of anybody being flooded out of their homes yet their yards are flooded and their septic systems are going down
7197966 the recovery centers are a place where people can go for water or just to get in some air conditioning and to get some information
7197967 the rain has tapered off some of the roads got wet very quickly and were treacherous to drive down
7197968 we had some branches down but none caused any damage
7197969 sunday is still going to be overcast with a few breaks as our friend fay slowly gets out shes a very unwelcome guest
7197970 as we start getting into tuesday we are looking at more climatological weather with partly cloudy skies and afternoon thundershowers
7197971 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
7197972 i have to watch the price of everything i buy
7197973 im 88 and dont want to give uncle sam everything
7197974 companies try to hold back as much of the increase as possible and actually absorb rising input costs when spikes are temporary or short lived
7197975 but in times like these when input costs commodities gas etc are rising fast and over extended periods of time inevitably consumers will see the impact at retail in a variety of ways
7197976 we realized hey we havent wrung this thing dry yet
7197977 it still provides value for customers and now were doing a better job of identifying what those better items are for them
7197978 i can grab some salad some veggies for the side and live on that for a while for not very much money
7197979 i was raised through the first depression and this one is getting worse because of the food and prices getting so high

7198179 singapore has accelerated in terms of pure economic growth and domestic savings
7198180 its becoming a very important financial hub and it will become a leisure hub as well for that reason were very bullish on singapore
7198181 in most regions the growth of wealth exceeds the rise in the number of high net worth individuals this reflects the global concentration of wealth
7198182 singapore is becoming a different place so property prices will go higher it is on par now with sydney but its tax rate is a fraction singapore will be a global financial centre therefore prices will reflect this right now higher rentals are very concentrated in grade a office space or residential areas in the 9 10 11 districts this will spread out across the island

7198186 in those days only hippies and mad people lived on boats and bristol marina was nothing like it is today
7198187 but now its one of the hippest not hippiest addresses in town it literally takes me three minutes to walk to work and when i get home in the evening i just sit on my boat crack open a beer and watch the sun go down its incredibly tranquil on the water plus these days we have all the conveniences of modern life electricity fresh water postal services telephone lines cable tv and even broadband internet connections
7198188 i wouldnt personally recommend a narrow boat as a home they can be well very narrow my wide beam boats measure 9 feet across 3m and are really quite spacious
7198189 i suppose they are in the sense that you can live in them i just liked the life and couldnt believe how cheap it was when a friend of mine told me about the other 3 boats for sale i couldnt resist they may not have gone up in value as much as houses in this part of the world but the rent comes in very handy
7198190 the number of people buying boats has been increasing steadily for many years
7198191 unless new boaters plan to cruise continually around the waterways network they will need to secure an appropriate mooring available residential berths are few and far between and often have long waiting lists
7198192 i now rent it out on a permanent basis through a property rental agency who treat it like any other property on their books they tell me they always have more people enquiring about the possibility of living on a boat but they only have mine and two others on their books at the moment
7198193 ironically im using the rent to build up a deposit to buy a flat but then again i might just buy another boat
7198194 its nice waking up to a different view in the morning and yet not too far from all the familiar comforts of home fortunately though none of my tenants have ever bothered going for a trip up the canals i prefer to keep my investments somewhere i can keep an eye on them
7198195 je ne voudrais pas pas vous vexer mais on dit de vous que vous tes un utopiste
7198196 au contraire vous mhonorez je revendique cette qualit ceux qui pensent arr ter leur regard sur lhorizon et se bornent regarder ce quon voit ceux qui revendiquent le pragmatisme et tentent de faire seulement avec ce quon a nont aucune chance de changer le monde seuls ceux qui regardent vers ce que lon ne voit pas ceux qui regardent au del de lhorizon sont r alistes ceux l ont une chance de changer le monde lutopie cest ce qui est au del de lhorizon notre raison analytique sait avec pr cision ce que nous ne voulons pas ce quil faut absolument changer mais ce qui doit venir ce que nous voulons le monde totalement autre nouveau seul notre regard int rieur seule lutopie en nous nous le montrent la raison analytique est un carcan lutopie est le b lier
7198197 luckily we were able to get them there with some savings and some loans but thats not the case for all young people
7198198 many of those who graduated with amberine have moved back into their parents homes to save up a deposit but the prices are just accelerating out of reach i kept thinking there must be a cheaper way to do this
7198199 but nobody was doing it with property we realised it could work no one individual would be covering the cost of a property which would otherwise have been out of their reach
7198200 we wanted to be completely certain of handing over the property without any problems
7198201 our first problem was convincing the public that the site is legitimate weve been surprised by the suspicion were doing everything by the book my husband is the type of man who cant even cope with a red utility bill were that cautious about everything we cant access the data while the auction is live so theres no way we could fix it plus we found an ofcom regulation which says this is a genuine auction because people bid competitively and a payment is made for each bid
7198202 although it seemed really obvious to us but we thought people might find it easier to grasp if there were items of smaller value on the site
7198203 i think its far more skill based than a lottery you can work out how to position yourself
7198204 and that would increase your chances you could then end up sharing a property or selling it and splitting the profit for a group of deposits if we did get to a point where we felt people were gambling too much we would try to contain the problem
7198205 we researched the cost of the professional services generally conducted prior to property auctions such as lawyers and surveyors
7198206 pre auction fees can cost upwards of 1 000 with no guarantee of winning the desired property for every auction winner there will be at least one other losing bidder who effectively wastes a significant chunk of their nest egg based on a conservative estimate of two disappointed bidders per lot and 60 per cent of those bidders spending 1 000 on pre auction surveys legal checks and mortgage arrangements we calculated that 21 963 600 was wasted in 2006

7198228 in het vasten ontdek ik pas goed wie mijn tegenstander is
7198229 het vasten moet uiteraard verantwoord gebeuren en bovendien vergezeld gaan van een soort geestelijk vasten je onthouden van slechte gedachten
7198230 california statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education
7198231 wie de verklaring van deze woorden zal vinden zal de dood niet smaken
7198232 laat hem die zoekt zonder ophouden zoeken totdat hij vindt en als hij vindt zal hij in verwarring raken en als hij in verwarring geraakt is zal hij zich verwonderen en hij zal heersen over het al
7198233 als uw leiders zeggen ziet het koninkrijk is in de hemel dan zullen de vogelen des velds u voorgaan als zij zeggen het is in de zee dan zullen de vissen u voorgaan maar het koninkrijk is binnen in u en buiten u
7198234 de grijsaard zal in zijn dagen niet aarzelen een klein kind van 7 dagen naar de plaats des levens te vragen en hij zal leven want vele eersten zullen de laatsten worden en zij zullen n worden
7198235 herken wat voor uw aangezicht is en wat verborgen is voor u zal u duidelijk worden want niets is verborgen wat niet geopenbaard zal worden
7198236 wilt gij dat wij vasten en hoe zullen wij bidden zullen wij aalmoezen geven en wat zullen wij betreffende het eten in acht nemen
7198237 vertel geen leugens en doe niet wat ge haat want alle dingen zijn duidelijk voor de hemel er is immers niets wat verborgen is dat niet openbaar zal worden en niets wat bedekt is dat ononthuld zal blijven
7198238 zalig de leeuw die mens wordt als hij door de mens opgegeten wordt en vervloekt is de mens die door de leeuw opgegeten wordt en de mens zal leeuw worden
7198239 de mens is gelijk aan een verstandige visser die zijn net in zee wierp hij trok het op uit de zee vol kleine vissen daartussen vond de verstandige visser een goede grote vis hij wierp al de kleine vissen terug in zee zonder aarzelen koos hij de grote vis wie oren heeft om te horen hij hore
7198240 ziet de zaaier ging naar buiten hij nam een hand vol zaad en strooide het uit sommige vielen op de weg de vogels kwamen en verzamelden ze andere vielen op de rots en zij schoten geen wortels in de aarde en maakten geen aren en anderen vielen op de doornen zij verstikten het zaad en de wormen vraten ze op en anderen vielen op de goede aarde en zij leverden goede vrucht op zij droegen zestig per maat en honderdtwintig per maat
7198241 ik heb het vuur op aarde geworpen en ziet ik hoed het tot het opvlamt
7198242 deze hemel zal vergaan en de hemel daarboven zal vergaan en de doden leven niet en de levenden zullen niet sterven in de dagen dat gij at wat dood is maakte gij het tot iets wat leeft als gij tot het licht zult komen wat zult gij dan doen toen gij n waart werd gij tot twee als gij echter twee zijt wat zult gij dan doen
7198243 wij weten dat gij van ons weg zult gaan wie zal dan onze meester zijn
7198244 waar ge ook bent gij zult naar jacobus de rechtvaardige gaan omwille van wie hemel en aarde zijn ontstaan
7198245 vergelijkt mij met iemand en zeg mij op wie ik lijk
7198246 meester mijn mond is geheel machteloos om te zeggen op wie gij lijkt
7198247 ik ben niet uw meester omdat gij gedronken hebt hebt gij u aan de opborrelende bron bedwelmd welke ik gewogen heb
7198248 als ik u een van die woorden zeg die hij mij gezegd heeft zult gij stenen nemen en naar mij werpen en vuur zal uit de stenen komen en u verbranden
7198249 als gij vast zult gij uzelf aanleiding geven tot zonde en als gij bidt zult gij veroordeeld worden en als gij aalmoezen geeft zult gij uw ziel kwaad doen en als gij naar een of ander land gaat en in die streken rondtrekt als men u ontvangt eet wat men u zal voorzetten en geneest de zieken onder hen want wat in uw mond binnengaat zal u niet verontreinigen wat echter uit de mond uitkomt dat zal u verontreinigen
7198250 als gij iemand ziet die niet uit een vrouw geboren is werpt u dan op uw aangezicht neer en aanbidt hem hij is uw vader
7198251 wellicht denken de mensen dat ik gekomen ben om vrede op de wereld te werpen en weten zij niet dat ik gekomen ben om tweespalt op aarde te werpen vuur zwaard en oorlog want er zullen er vijf in n huis zijn drie zullen tegen twee zijn de vader tegen de zoon en de zoon tegen de vader en ze zullen daar alleen staan
7198252 ik zal u geven wat geen oog gezien heeft geen oor gehoord en geen hand aangeraakt en wat bij geen mens in de geest is opgekomen
7198253 hebt gij dan de aanvang ontdekt dat gij naar het einde zoekt waar het begin is daar zal ook het einde zijn zalig degene die zich in het begin plaatst hij zal ook het einde kennen en hij zal de dood niet smaken
7198254 zalig wie is voor hij werd als gij mijn leerlingen wordt en luistert naar mijn woorden zullen deze stenen u dienen want er zijn vijf bomen voor u in het paradijs die s zomers en s winters onverstoord blijven en wier bladeren nooit afvallen wie ze zal kennen zal de dood niet smaken
7198255 het lijkt op een mosterdzaadje het kleinste van alle zaadjes als het echter op bewerkte aarde valt wordt het een grote plant en wordt een schuilplaats voor de vogelen des hemels
7198256 zij lijken op kinderen die zich op een veld ophouden dat hun niet toebehoort wanneer de eigenaren van het veld komen zullen zij zeggen geef ons veld terug zij kleden zich voor hen uit opdat zij het hun laten en hun het veld geven daarom zeg ik u als de heer des huizes weet dat de dief komt zal hij waken voor hij gekomen is en hem niet in het huis van zijn landgoed laten inbreken om zijn zaken weg te dragen gij echter wees op je hoede tegenover de wereld bewapen u met grote kracht opdat de rovers geen weg vinden om bij u te komen want de moeilijkheden die gij verwacht zullen uitkomen laat er onder u een verstandig man zijn toen het graan rijpte kwam hij ijlings met zijn sikkel in de hand en oogstte het wie oren heeft om te horen hij hore
7198257 deze zuigende kleinen zijn als diegenen die in het koninkrijk binnengaan
7198258 als gij de twee n maakt en als gij het inwendige gelijk het uitwendige maakt en het uitwendige gelijk het inwendige en het boven gelijk het ondere en als gij het mannelijke en het vrouwelijke n maakt zodat het mannelijke niet mannelijke en het vrouwelijke niet vrouwelijk zij en als gij ogen vormt in plaats van een oog een hand in plaats van een hand een voet in plaats van een voet een gelijkenis in plaats van een gelijkenis dan zult gij ingaan
7198259 ik zal u uitkiezen n uit duizend en twee uit tienduizend en zij zullen daar staan als een eenling
7198260 toon ons de plaats waar gij zijt want wij moeten daarnaar zoeken
7198261 wie oren heeft om te horen hore er is licht in een licht mens en hij verlicht de hele wereld verlicht hij niet dan is er duisternis
7198262 hebt uw broeder lief als je ziel waak over hem als de appel van uw oog
7198263 de splinter in het oog van uw broeder ziet gij de balk echter in uw eigen oog ziet gij niet als gij de balk uit uw oog haalt dan zult gij helder kunnen zien om de splinter uit het oog van uw broeder te halen
7198264 als gij niet vast ten opzichte van de wereld zult gij het koninkrijk niet vinden als gij de sabbat niet als sabbat houdt zult gij de vader niet zien
7198265 ik nam plaats midden in de wereld en verscheen aan hen vleselijk ik vond ze allen dronken geen enkele onder hen vond ik dorstig en mijn ziel leed smart over de zonen der mensen want blind zijn ze in hun hart en zij zien niet want leeg zijn zij in de wereld gekomen en ook leeg zoeken zij de wereld te verlaten maar nu zijn zij dronken als zij hun wijn opgeven zullen zij zich bekeren
7198266 als het lichaam omwille van de geest ontstaan is is het een wonder als echter de geest omwille van het lichaam ontstaan is is het een wonder der wonderen ik verbaas mij er inderdaad over hoe deze grote rijkdom in deze armoe is komen wonen
7198267 waar drie goden zijn zijn zij goden waar er twee of een zijn ben ik met hem
7198268 geen profeet wordt aanvaard in zijn dorp geen arts geneest diegenen die hem kennen
7198269 een stad die op een hoge berg gebouwd wordt en sterk is kan niet vallen noch zal hij verborgen kunnen zijn
7198270 verkondig van de daken wat gij met uw oor zult horen want niemand ontsteekt een lamp en plaatst haar onder de korenmaat noch zet hij haar op een verborgen plaats veeleer zet hij haar op een kandelaar opdat allen die binnenkomen en uitgaan haar licht zullen zien
7198271 als een blinde een blinde leidt vallen zij beiden in een kuil
7198272 niemand kan het huis van een sterke binnendringen en het met geweld innemen tenzij hij zijn handen bindt dan zal hij zijn huis leegruimen
7198273 weest niet van s morgens tot s avonds en van s avonds tot s morgens bezorgd over wat gij zult aantrekken
7198274 op welke dag zult gij ons verschijnen en op welke dag zullen wij u zien
7198275 als gij u ontkleedt zonder u te schamen en als gij uw klederen neemt en ze als kleine kinderen onder uw voeten legt en er op zult treden dan zult gij de zoon van de levende zien en gij zult niet bevreesd zijn
7198276 vele malen hebt gij ernaar verlangd deze woorden te horen die ik tot u spreek en gij hebt niemand anders om ze van te horen er zullen dagen komen dat gij naar mij zult zoeken en mij niet vinden
7198277 de farizee n en de schriftgeleerden hebben de sleutelen van de kennis genomen en ze verborgen zelf zijn zij niet binnengegaan noch hebben zij hen die binnen willen gaan toegelaten gij echter weest slim als de slangen en argeloos als de duiven
7198278 een wijnstok werd buiten de vader geplant en krachteloos zal hij met wortel en al uitgerukt worden en te gronde gaan
7198279 wie iets in zijn hand heeft hem zal meer gegeven worden en wie niets heeft hem zal ook het beetje ontnomen worden wat hij heeft
7198280 wie zijt gij dat gij deze dingen tot ons zegt
7198281 begrijpt gij niet wie ik ben door datgene wat ik tot u zeg maar gij zijt als de joden geworden want zij houden van de boom en haten zijn vrucht of houden van de vrucht en haten de boom
7198282 wie de vader zal lasteren hem zal vergeven worden en wie de zoon zal lasteren hem zal vergeven worden wie echter de heilige geest zal lasteren hem zal noch op aarde noch in de hemel vergeven worden
7198283 men plukt geen druiven van doornen en verzamelt geen vijgen van distels zij brengen geen vrucht voort een goede man brengt goede waren voort uit zijn voorraadschuur een slechte man haalt slechte zaken tevoorschijn uit zijn voorraadschuur zijn hart en hij spreekt kwaad want uit de overvloed van zijn hart haalt hij slechtheid tevoorschijn
7198284 van adam tot johannes de doper staat onder de uit vrouwen geborenen niemand hoger dan johannes de doper opdat zijn ogen niet breken ik heb echter gezegd wie onder u een kind zal worden zal het koninkrijk erkennen en zal groter dan johannes worden
7198285 een mens kan niet op twee paarden rijden of twee bogen spannen en een knecht kan geen twee heren dienen of hij zal de een eren en de andere smaden men drinkt nooit oude wijn en verlangt onmiddellijk nieuwe te drinken ook giet men geen nieuwe wijn in oude zakken opdat zij niet barsten en men giet geen oude wijn in een nieuwe zak opdat hij hem niet bederve men naait geen oude lappen op een nieuw kleed want er zal een scheur ontstaan
7198286 als er twee in hetzelfde huis in vrede met elkander leven dan zullen zij tot de berg zeggen verplaats u en hij zal zich verplaatsen
7198287 zalig de eenlingen en de uitverkorenen want zij zullen het koninkrijk vinden daar gij daaruit zijt en daarheen zult gij weerkeren
7198288 als de mensen u zeggen waar komt gij vandaan zegt hun dan wij zijn uit het licht gekomen daar waar het licht uit zichzelf ontstaan is het stond en openbaarde zich in hun beeld als men tot u zegt zijt gij het zegt dan wij zijn de kinderen van het licht en zijn de uitverkorenen van de levende vader als de mensen u vragen wat is het teken van uw vader in u zegt hun dan het is beweging en rust
7198289 op welke dag zal de rust der doden intreden en op welke dag komt de nieuwe wereld hij sprak tot hen
7198290 vierentwintig profeten hebben in isra l gesproken en zij hebben allen in u gesproken
7198291 gij hebt de levende onder u veronachtzaamd en over de doden gesproken
7198292 zalig de armen want voor jullie is het koninkrijk van de hemel
7198293 wie zijn vader niet haat en zijn moeder kan bij mij geen leerling zijn en wie zijn broeders niet zal haten en zijn zusters en zijn kruis niet zal dragen op mijn wijze zal mij niet waardig zijn
7198294 wie de wereld heeft begrepen heeft een lijk gevonden en wie een lijk gevonden heeft de wereld is hem niet waardig
7198295 het koninkrijk van de vader is gelijk aan een man die goed zaad heeft zijn vijand kwam s nachts en zaaide onkruid onder het goede zaad de man liet hen het onkruid niet uitrukken hij zei tot hen ik ben bang dat als jullie willen gaan om het onkruid uit te rukken en het graan samen daarmee zult uitrukken op de dag van de oogst zal het onkruid duidelijk zichtbaar zijn en het zal uitgerukt en verbrand worden
7198296 zalig de mens die geleden heeft en het leven gevonden heeft
7198297 ziet naar de levende zolang gij leeft opdat gij niet sterft en hem zoekt te zien maar hem niet zult kunnen zien
7198298 zolang het leeft zal hij het niet eten maar alleen als hij het doodt en het een kadaver wordt
7198299 zoekt ook gij u een plaats om te rusten opdat gij geen kadaver wordt en opgegeten wordt
7198300 twee zullen op n bed rusten de een zal leven de ander sterven
7198301 wie zijt gij mens als uit een gij hebt mijn bed bestegen en van mijn tafel gegeten
7198302 ik ben hij die bestaat uit de onverdeelde mij werd gegeven wat van mijn vader is
7198303 daarom zeg ik als hij onverdeeld is zal hij vervuld worden van licht als hij echter verdeeld is zal hij vervuld worden met duisternis
7198304 ik zeg mijn geheimenissen aan diegenen die mijn geheimenissen waardig zijn laat uw rechterhand niet weten wat uw linkerhand doet
7198305 een rijk man had vele goederen hij zei ik zal mijn goederen benutten om te zaaien te oogsten te planten en mijn schuren met vrucht te vullen opdat ik aan niets gebrek lijde dat was wat hij in zijn hart dacht en die nacht stierf hij wie oren heeft om te horen hij hore
7198306 een man had gasten en toen hij het maal bereid had zond hij zijn knecht uit om de gasten uit te nodigen hij kwam bij de eerste en zei hem mijn heer nodigt u uit hij zei kooplieden zijn mij geld schuldig vanavond komen zij bij mij en ik zal ernaar toegaan en hen richtlijnen geven ik verzoek u mij voor het maal te verontschuldigen hij kwam bij een andere en zei hem mijn heer heeft u uitgenodigd hij zei hem ik heb een huis gekocht en men vraagt mij om een dag ik zal geen tijd hebben hij kwam bij een andere en zei hem mijn heer nodigt u uit hij zei hem mijn vriend gaat trouwen en ik moet het maal inrichten ik zal niet kunnen komen ik verzoek u mij voor het maal te verontschuldigen hij ging naar een andere en zei hem mijn heer nodigt u uit hij zei hem ik heb een dorp gekocht ik ga om pacht te innen ik zal niet kunnen komen ik verzoek u mij te verontschuldigen de knecht kwam en zei tot zijn heer zij die gij tot het maal hebt uitgenodigd hebben verzocht hen te verontschuldigen de heer zei tot zijn knecht ga uit op de wegen en breng naar hier wie gij zult vinden opdat zij het feestmaal houden de zakenlieden en kooplieden zullen niet binnengaan in de plaatsen van mijn vader
7198307 een goed man had een wijngaard hij gaf hem aan pachters opdat zij hem zouden bewerken en hij van hen zijn vrucht zou krijgen hij zond zijn knecht opdat de boeren hem de vrucht van zijn wijngaard zouden geven zij grepen de knecht sloegen hem en het scheelde niet veel of zij hadden hem gedood de knecht ging heen en zei het aan zijn heer zijn heer zei wellicht herkenden zij hem niet en hij zond een andere knecht de pachters sloegen ook de andere toen zond de heer zijn zoon hij zei wellicht hebben zij schroom voor mijn zoon de pachters die wisten dat hij de erfgenaam van de wijngaard was grepen hem en doodden hem wie oren heeft om te horen hij hore
7198308 toon mij de steen welke de bouwlieden verworpen hebben het is de hoeksteen
7198309 wie gelooft dat het al onvolkomen is is zelf helemaal onvolkomen
7198310 zalig zijt gij als men u haat en vervolgt waar gij ook vervolgd wordt daar zullen zij geen plaats hebben
7198311 zalig zijn zij die vervolgd worden in hun hart zij zijn het die de vader waarlijk zullen kennen zalig zijn de hongerenden want de buik van hen die verlangen zal gevuld worden
7198312 dat wat gij in u hebt zal u redden als gij het uit uzelf voortbrengt wanneer gij dat wat gij in u hebt niet zult voortbrengen dan zal het u doden
7198313 ik zal dit huis vernietigen en niemand zal in staat zijn het te herbouwen
7198314 zeg mijn broeders dat zij de bezittingen van mijn vader met mij delen
7198315 de oogst is groot maar de arbeiders zijn weinig smeek de heer daarom dat hij arbeiders uitzendt naar de oogst
7198316 o heer velen staan rond de drinkbak maar er is niets in de put
7198317 velen staan voor de deur maar het is de eenling die het bruidsvertrek zal ingaan
7198318 het koninkrijk is gelijk aan een koopman die een zending koopwaar heeft en die een parel ontdekte de koopman was schrander hij verkocht de koopwaar en kocht de parel alleen voor hemzelf ook gij zoekt zijn onvergankelijke blijvende schat waar geen mot bij komt om te vreten en geen worm vernietigt
7198319 ik ben het die het licht boven allen is ik ben het die het al is uit mij is het al voortgekomen en tot mij spreidt het al zich uit splijt een stuk hout en ik ben daar hef de steen op en je zult mij daar vinden
7198320 waarom zijt gij naar buiten de woestijn in gegaan om het riet te zien dat door de wind bewogen wordt om een mens te zien die fijne kleren draagt zoals uw koningen en grote mannen zij dragen fijne kleren en zij zijn onmachtig de waarheid te onderscheiden
7198321 zalig de schoot die u gedragen heeft en de borsten die u gezoogd hebben
7198322 zalig diegenen die het woord van de vader gehoord hebben en het in waarheid bewaard hebben want er zullen dagen komen dat gij zegt zalig de schoot die niet ontvangen heeft en de borsten die geen melk gegeven hebben
7198323 wie de wereld herkend heeft heeft het lichaam gevonden wie echter het lichaam heeft gevonden is groter dan de wereld
7198324 laat hem die rijk geworden is koning zijn en laat hem die macht heeft deze verzaken
7198325 wie dicht bij mij is is dicht bij het vuur en wie ver van mij is is ver van het koninkrijk
7198326 de beelden openbaren zich aan de mensen maar het licht in hen blijft verborgen in het beeld van het licht van de vader hij zal geopenbaard worden maar zijn beeld zal verborgen blijven door zijn licht
7198327 als gij uw evenbeeld ziet verheug u als gij echter uw beelden ziet die ontstaan zijn voor u die noch sterven noch openbaar worden hoeveel zult gij kunnen verdragen
7198328 adam is ontstaan uit grote macht en grote rijkdom maar hij werd u niet waardig immers was hij waardig geweest hij zou de dood niet gesmaakt hebben
7198329 de vossen hebben hun holen de vogels hebben hun nest maar de mensenzoon heeft geen plaats om zijn hoofd neer te leggen en te rusten
7198330 ellendig is het lichaam dat zich verlaat op het lichaam en ellendig is de ziel die zich verlaat op deze beiden
7198331 de engelen en profeten zullen tot u komen en u geven wat gij al hebt en ook gij geeft hen wat in uw handen is en zeg tot uzelf op welke dag zullen zij komen en nemen wat het hunne is
7198332 waarom wast gij de buitenzijde van de beker begrijpt gij niet dat hij die de binnenkant maakte dezelfde is die de buitenkant maakte
7198333 komt tot mij want mijn juk is licht en mijn heerschappij is mild en gij zult rust vinden voor uzelf
7198334 zeg ons wie gij zijt opdat wij in u geloven
7198335 gij leest het gelaat van hemel en aarde er gij hebt niet degene die voor u is herkend en gij weet niet dit moment te lezen
7198336 zoekt en gij zult vinden maar waarover gij mij vroeg in eerder dagen en wat ik u toen niet verteld heb daarover wil ik nu graag vertellen maar u vraagt er niet naar
7198337 geeft het heilige niet aan de honden opdat zij het niet op de mesthoop werpen werpt de paarlen niet voor de zwijnen opdat zij ze niet tot stukken vermalen
7198338 wie zoekt zal vinden en wie klopt hij zal binnengelaten worden
7198339 als je geld hebt leen het niet uit tegen rente maar geef het aan hem van wie je het niet terugkrijgt
7198340 het koninkrijk van de vader is gelijk een zekere vrouw zij nam een weinig zuurdeeg verborg het in het deeg en maakte er grote broden van wie oren heeft om te horen hij hore
7198341 het koninkrijk van de vader is gelijk een vrouw die een kruik vol meel draagt lopend op een weg nog een eind van huis brak het oor van de kruik en het meel stroomde achter haar op de weg zij merkte niets zij had niet gemerkt dat er wat gebeurde toen ze thuis kwam zette ze de kruik neer en merkte dat hij leeg was
7198342 het koninkrijk van de vader is als een man die een sterke man wil doden thuis trok hij het zwaard en stiet het in de muur om zich er te van gewissen of zijn hand sterk zou zijn toen doodde hij de machtige
7198343 deze hier die de wil van mijn vader doen dat zijn mijn broeders en mijn moeder zij zijn het die het koninkrijk van mijn vader zullen ingaan
7198344 geef de keizer wat de keizer toebehoort geef god wat god toebehoort en geef mij wat mijn is
7198345 wie zijn vader niet zal haten en zijn moeder zoals ik doe kan geen leerling van mij worden en wie niet zijn vader en moeder liefheeft zoals ik doe kan geen leerling van mij worden want mijn moeder gaf mij leugens maar mijn echte moeder gaf mij het leven
7198346 wee de farizee n zij zijn gelijk een hond die op de ossenkrib ligt zelf eet hij niet noch laat hij de ossen eten
7198347 zalig de man die weet langs welke weg de rovers binnenkomen opdat hij kan opstaan zijn landgoed inspecteren en zich bewapenen voor zij binnendringen
7198348 welke zonde heb ik dan begaan of waarin ben ik bezweken maar als de bruidegom het bruidsvertrek verlaat dan moeten zij vasten en bidden

7198485 they told me there would be competition for the starting job and im thankful for this opportunity
7198486 there was never a thought that i would stop playing football
7198487 i was looking for an opportunity to play the longer i went along the more i focused and realized it was about the things i could control
7198488 i definitely never did not believe in myself its hard for a young guy to have your coach or a personnel person tell you that youre not good enough its just one persons opinion
7198489 when he was a ballboy i hate to say this but he was there throwing on the sideline one day and some of the players said hey he looks better than our backup quarterback
7198490 i had a chance to talk to him about a lot of things dealing with life
7198491 i tried not to talk to him much about football or worry about whats going to happen when he gets out eventually just more so of being there in support of him as ive been i let him know i was there for him whenever he gets out
7198492 john is a guy that you look to gauge yourself against a guy who really plays the game the way it should be played
7198493 hes one of the greatest safeties to play this game he doesnt find an excuse a guy who is a proven warrior who plays hurt has had a number of things happen to him and continues to go out there and fight
7198494 what i try to do in the offseason is pick two to three guys and study them and rodneys always one of the guys at the top of our profession
7198495 my whole thing is if im not going be treated fairly and my hard work and loyalty isnt going to be rewarded here then let me go somewhere where it will be rewarded
7198496 i am not convinced that i would gain anything from having an agent at this point in my career
7198497 the thing about it is you have to take the good with the bad
7198498 youre going to have bad games the thing vince has to do is move on after something bad happens and just forget about it you have to have amnesia and move on
7198499 i tell him if you get into a fight with the media youre going to lose every time
7198500 its just that growing spurt he has to go through hell realize it
7198501 this is just his third year and vince has a lot to learn and a lot to improve on and he will hes so competitive and he wants to do everything right and it gets to him if he doesnt live up to fans and coaches expectations

7198505 the play will be a visual treat for all theatre enthusiasts here
7198506 with illustrious actors such as mohanlal and mukesh on stage chayamukhi will certainly turn out to be an unforgettable experience for all of us
7198507 though i have come into the world of films i am basically from a theatre background my father has been running a theatre group called kalidasa kalakendra for the last 50 years
7198508 for the last two and a half years we have been working on finding a suitable project
7198509 i saw chayamukhi on an amateur stage everything was there except perhaps the grandeur when i told mohanlal about it he immediately said that this was the project for us
7198510 i have done a lot of theatre in college like sanskrit dramas when mukesh came to me with the chayamukhi project i became very interested
7198511 chayamukhis characters are based on characters from the mahabharata the play carries a message but it is for the audience how to interpret it
7198512 already malayalam actors like mammoothy and sreenivasan have got in touch with me saying that they would like to be part of my future projects
7198513 film director priyadarshan has also told me that he has at least two ideas in his mind for theatre and wants to work with me it is heartening to note that the thought of doing theatre has crossed peoples minds
7198514 i read about the process of artificial fertilisation in the newspaper and went to a clinic in meerut where they told me it might work for my mother in law
7198515 when i entered the hospital she was lying on a stretcher covered with a sheet
7198516 the caesarean was complicated since she had low blood pressure and was bleeding profusely and the babies were in breach position upside down
7198517 she had not been taking proper treatment and was going to different local doctors which must also have affected the health of the babies
7198518 we have an agreement with barcroft media that we will not allow anyone else to photograph om kali and the twins
7198519 no photographs of the woman and children for less than rs 50 000
7198520 they have had to sell five bighas of their seven bighas of land and now they have nothing
7198521 after hearing about them people have started coming to me saying you managed to deliver a baby for a 70 year old im only 56 i explain to them that it is not only very dangerous to undergo artificial fertilisation at that age but also that thereafter they have hardly any time left to spend raising their children
7198522 unfortunately there has been little change in rural society with regard to the desire for a male child
7198523 it has become more difficult to cheat because we have augmented the number of tests from 3 500 in athens to 4 500
7198524 secondly we have also increased the penalties the new rule that an athlete that has been penalised for more than six months by his or her federation will not be able to compete in the next games

7198526 contrary to almost all predictions about the impact of immigrants upon an economy a majority of nigerians in ireland are not economically active at all
7198527 to prove we can still compete with other teams in the competition
7198528 i think colin best and campese did a really good job and we struggled to contain them
7198529 theyre just a gutsy team they just guts every game out and theyve been in some great form
7198530 so we knew they would come out strongly and we knew that if we played the way we wanted to play we could beat them
7198531 its handy to have those guys come back were looking pretty strong and weve just go to keep our heads down now and keep working
7198532 our midfields been pretty solid all year with joel corey and lingy and jimmy bartel and joel selwood theyre all pretty tough to match up on and hopefully we can keep the form going
7198533 no horsing around with me buddy you hurt me youll be in trouble

7198535 if i stop and think about it my life is pathetic so generally i dont stop and think about it ive been in total denial which is why i buy trendy figure hugging t shirts because if i am going to deny the fact that i am old i might as well deny the fact that i am fat as well reassuringly i am not alone while many people in their forties have families and responsibilities an increasing minority still resemble teenagers scary wrinkled grey haired teenagers with some kind of terrifying premature ageing disease but teenagers nonetheless

7198538 we heard that mdi the creators of the aircar excuse us the
7198539 we are delighted to present this rare retrospective that examines one of south asias great 20th century artists
7198540 boses art is inextricably bound to the story of indias national awakening and independence and at the same time is deeply personal and nuanced although he was highly influential to a younger generation of artists his work represents an area of modern art that has been little understood in the united states
7198541 word is that contemporary indian art is the next sensation on the international market so nows the time to learn something about where it came from
7198542 reminds us that every museum of modern art in the united states and europe should be required in the spirit of truth in advertising to change its name to museum of western modernism until it has earned the right to do otherwise
7198543 these wide ranging works by many of indias pre eminent 20th and 21st century artists offer visitors an excellent context in which to view nandalal boses art and connect it with south asias vibrant contemporary art scene

7198553 the whole event is excellent its things you dont get to see often hopefully it becomes an annual event
7198554 i was stunned last night and delighted because i think enough people had heard about it it was about one third as much as when we won the basketball tournament i mean there were people all over downtown almost spilling into the streets
7198555 those buskers last night were all smiling at the end because they know they were doing a good job they had a big responsive crowd and then to top it off people were willing to lay down a dollar or two to say thanks for the great job
7198556 i would just eat it up if i lived here

7198596 finding the incredibly tiny interstellar dust impacts in the stardust interstellar dust collector sidc will be extremely difficult because dust detectors on the ulysses and galileo spacecraft have detected interstellar dust streaming into the solar system we know there should be about 45 interstellar dust impacts in the sidc these impacts can only be found using a high magnification microscope with a field of view smaller than a grain of salt but the aerogel collector that we have to search enormous by comparison about a tenth of a square meter about a square foot in size the job is roughly equivalent to searching for 45 ants in an entire football field one 5cm by 5cm 2 inch by 2 inch square at a time more than 1 6 million individual fields of view will have to be searched to find the interstellar dust grains we estimate that it would take more than twenty years of continuous scanning for us to search the entire collector by ourselves

7198631 arent you the guy who thought balkman was a great pick didnt you think lee would be traded for mayo now you see randolph as valuable

7198640 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7198641 theres less than 1 percent of the population of iowa that is african american there is probably less than 4 or 5 percent that are minorities what is in washington so look it goes back to what you start off with what youre dealing with
7198642 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
7198643 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
7198644 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
7198645 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil

7198657 about superman and batman the former is how america views itself the latter darker character is how the rest of the world views america
7198658 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7198659 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7198660 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7198661 yeah we left our room open and someone came in and took stuff
7198662 yeah but its weird because all they took was the fruit loops
7198663 it was some girls i was like you can keep them i dont care if you need them
7198664 i am sooo drunk i dont know if any of you guys are but i am laughs i dont know my stomach hurts im sooooo drunk

7198668 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7198669 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7198670 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7198671 is that i wish a woman would have been on the ticket but alas america is not ready to embrace and support having a woman on the ticket top or otherwise
7198672 this is a guy who can out straight talk the straight talk express
7198673 you might not always like what joe says but hes going to give it to you straight
7198674 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7198675 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7198676 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7198677 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7198678 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7198679 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7198680 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7198681 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all

7198685 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7198686 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7198687 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7198688 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7198689 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7198690 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7198691 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7198692 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7198693 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7198694 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7198695 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials

7198697 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7198698 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7198699 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7198700 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7198701 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling

7198712 its incredibly exciting and something that i think will change the way i think
7198713 the chinese culture is changing and evolving so to be immersed in it is a rare opportunity
7198714 elections have changed dramatically over the years money power and name recognition are the three basic ingredients for a winner whether or not that candidate has any qualifications
7198715 this is fine for the corporate world or the entertainment industry but not for democracy
7198716 voters are bombarded with repetitive subjective messages about the candidates personality and biography
7198717 the system seems designed to focus their attention on what the candidates look like or who is ahead rather than what they promise theyll do for the country with an awareness of the techniques campaigns use and how to find better information people can look beyond what the candidates want them to see and understand the truth about the people who are looking to represent them and how they propose to represent them
7198718 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7198719 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7198720 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7198721 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7198722 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7198723 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7198724 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7198725 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7198726 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7198727 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7198728 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7198729 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7198730 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7198731 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7198732 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7198733 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7198734 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7198735 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7198736 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7198737 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7198738 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7198739 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7198740 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7198741 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7198742 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7198743 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7198744 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7198745 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7198746 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7198747 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7198748 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7198749 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7198750 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7198751 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7198752 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7198753 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7198754 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7198755 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7198756 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7198757 the bill permits the board of game to allow a predator program for wolves and grizzly bears if the commissioner of fish and game finds an emergency where wolves or grizzly bears in an area are causing a decline in prey
7198758 the first building of the summer palace the gold mountain palace was built by the first emperor of the jin dynasty succeeding emperors and dynasties have built on and it eventually became what i deemed a vacation resort for the emperors in 1860 the british and french troops burnt down most of the summer palace it was rebuilt 18 years later so much of what i saw yesterday was a reconstruction
7198759 you are going to stand by me the rest of the day
7198760 its incredibly exciting and something that i think will change the way i think
7198761 the chinese culture is changing and evolving so to be immersed in it is a rare opportunity
7198762 republican always always campaign by protraying the democratic candidate as an out of touch elitist
7198763 democrats in general and obama in particular have trouble connecting with working class voters
7198764 mccain s a graduate of annapolis i know a lot of the annapolis breed remember i m west point where i was born my father went there
7198765 so the obama campaign is going all out on the issue of mccain s multiple houses isn t that kind of stupid

7198770 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7198771 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7198772 im just not finding the right people i think that day rate really scares people off they want sag rates
7198773 if we had the money for just one day of sag scale we could make 20 movies were not kidding when we say this is the new depression
7198774 what if im already dead and this is all just a memory

7198780 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7198781 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7198782 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman

7198785 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7198786 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7198787 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7198788 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7198789 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7198790 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7198791 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7198792 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7198793 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7198794 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7198795 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7198796 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7198797 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7198798 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7198799 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7198800 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7198801 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7198802 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7198803 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7198804 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7198805 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7198806 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7198807 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7198808 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7198809 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7198810 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7198811 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7198812 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7198813 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7198814 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7198815 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7198816 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7198817 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7198818 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7198819 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7198820 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7198821 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7198822 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7198823 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
7198824 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7198825 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7198826 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7198827 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7198828 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7198829 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7198830 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7198831 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7198832 me encantar a hacer un disco de orquesta sinf nica o a lo mejor alg n d a escribir un gui n para una pel cula y hasta yo mismo dirigirla
7198833 m s que natalia mi paternidad porque no todas mis canciones hablan de mi hija pero s creo que se abrieron ciertas conciencias y sensibilidades a partir de que lleg natalia a mi vida
7198834 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7198835 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7198836 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7198837 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7198838 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7198839 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7198840 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7198841 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7198842 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7198843 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7198844 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7198845 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7198846 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7198847 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7198848 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7198849 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7198850 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7198851 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7198852 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7198853 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7198854 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7198855 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7198856 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7198857 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7198858 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7198859 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7198860 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7198861 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7198862 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7198863 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7198864 today men are consumed by desires to buy things they dont need with money they dont have to impress people they dont like
7198865 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7198866 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7198867 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7198868 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7198869 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7198870 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7198871 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7198872 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7198873 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7198874 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7198875 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7198876 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7198877 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7198878 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7198879 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7198880 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7198881 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7198882 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7198883 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7198884 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7198885 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7198886 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7198887 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7198888 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7198889 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7198890 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7198891 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7198892 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7198893 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7198894 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7198895 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7198896 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7198897 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7198898 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7198899 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7198900 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7198901 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7198902 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7198903 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7198904 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7198905 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7198906 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7198907 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7198908 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7198909 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7198910 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7198911 cest un beau succ s une tape est franchie dans la construction du nouveau parti anticapitaliste

7198925 well its the launch of the western australian campaign thats precisely what its about dr nelson said
7198926 its about colin barnett and the liberal team in western australia making sure that they take it well and truly up to mr carpenter over the next two weeks
7198927 ive got nothing to say beyond what ive already said dr nelson said
7198928 the important thing here is that its important that the government prepare and release an economic statement our economy is slowing very sharply
7198929 weve got plummeting business and consumer confidence the reserve bank is forecasting inflation at five per cent in december and the economy has slowed to two per cent growth by the end of the year
7198930 the single most important thing we will be focused on this week is the fact that australians are worse off under mr rudd than they were under the coalition last year
7198931 well its the launch of the western australian campaign thats precisely what its about dr nelson said
7198932 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7198933 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you

7198939 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7198940 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7198941 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7198942 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7198943 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7198944 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7198945 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7198946 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7198947 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7198948 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country

7198954 all changes even the most longed for have their melancholy for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves we must die to one life before we can enter another
7198955 those who expect moments of change to be comfortable and free of conflict have not learned their history
7198956 what you have become is the price you paid to get what you used to want
7198957 honestly when you have two guys that can run like they can thats better for their bodies over the course of a season
7198958 you have to have a couple of guys certainly every game is not going to be like that i know that but when you have two guys that can pound it and hit it in there like they can and have that breakaway ability it can only get better
7198959 when im out of the game or when im in there you really cant tell
7198960 the only thing that changes is the jersey number 28 or 34 it keeps the defense on their heels not only in the run game but in the passing game as well because if youre able to run the ball effectively like coach john fox always says its that much easier to pass the ball
7198961 weve wanted to be able to run the ball for some time
7198962 weve had successful years in 2003 and 05 getting jake back in there helps us last year it was a little bit tougher in the run game because people stacked the box because they didnt feel like we could throw the ball effectively hopefully that will be different this year
7198963 wee had holes but i think what you saw was the explosiveness of both backs tonight
7198964 you know jon just busted through there and took off and deangelo too well get to see the true deangelo this year i mean the last couple of years lets be honest we didnt get to see a true test i think were much better up front on the offensive line than weve been in awhile
7198965 deangelo got better from last year to this year as far as his maturation process becoming more of a pro

7198973 i havent seen a definite release date for the blackberry curve on the at amp t network and the reported issues with the 3g radio may be delaying the release there were reports that the infineon chip was a possible cause of the problem

7198975 im just not convinced this is apples problem here in richmond va i get horrible 3g data performance
7198976 man no matter how many people spend unmeasurable hours trying to help me i will continue to complain and discredit them
7198977 the 3g does not make me talk any faster laugh if i bring up a web page and it takes me an extra second or even minute i am not worried as edge or 3g works very well i can see if your in the middle of a train track and a train is coming and you were wondering what time it left the station before you get hit by it i can see then how 3g heck 10g would be really a good thing for you before you get hit be happy

7198980 this election is going to be decisive definitely if anwar wins we will be one step closer to taking over the government
7198981 from our assessment we are leading we have to win big it will mean the people reject
7198982 it is un malay to make these allegations anwar has a family and he has five daughters
7198983 politics is one thing but you are shaming a family man i am afraid that if we go overboard in attacking him and accusing him of anti malay it will backfire we will lose votes we saw that happen in the march polls

7199049 did you make sure to hook them both up to the leads
7199050 i have heard a lot of out of phase and thats not out of phase
7199051 we need to hook it up the right way and its gonna take another hour and youll need to pay extra labor and parts
7199052 but i think if we just follow the instructions and test it by reversing this one wire i mean it sounds out of phase
7199053 um yeah were busy so come back some other time

7199073 will close the margin but it wont overtake that margin
7199074 its probably because hes going to be doing something else
7199075 in coweta we saw it coming up and addressed it early
7199076 this is a great day for democrats in coweta county it shows were back out there and working hard and with obama now we know that any american can be president when you get this far youre finally in the game and thats what its al about there are good days ahead for coweta democrats folks in the past said i had sold out to the republicans to get elected but thats not true at all i was born a democrat and ill die a democrat and i was the last democrat standing on the county commission im glad were coming back
7199077 i think its good that obama selected someone who doesnt always agree with him
7199078 biden knows the old guard and the new guard and has forward thinking ideology i think its a good move
7199079 what we have in common is more important than what sets us apart
7199080 its terribly exciting and i cant wait to see all the people and attend all the events
7199081 this campaign has brought us all renewed hope and im glad to be part of it
7199082 this is the best thing thats happened in coweta county in 30 years its been a privilege to be part of it
7199083 this campaign is one of hope and change instead of fear and the same old business as usual
7199084 for the vast majority of our 800 plus employees this change will not affect them at all
7199085 all functions and departments will remain and continue to do the work that theyve always done
7199086 there will be some changes in the management reporting structure in terms of where individual departments and department heads will report but again no positions will be eliminated
7199087 i know of at least two who would have died had somebody not checked on them they had fallen and couldnt get up
7199088 if nobody had checked on them they would have lain there and starved to death
7199089 i think it is one of the most successful best received programs weve ever done
7199090 the dispatcher in new york is supposed to contact us
7199091 weve gotten calls from them where the information they had was absolutely terrible we couldnt call the people based on what they had
7199092 weve had occasions where we didnt get them and wed call a relative or neighbor and theyd say oh she probably didnt have a chance to call shes in the hospital
7199093 if we dont find out anything in a reasonable amount of time were going to send the troops
7199094 wed rather do that than have somebody out there dying
7199095 we try not to do that if we dont have to
7199096 the best thing is for them to give us the location of a key that is hidden on the premises
7199097 loves to go around and try to help these people
7199098 the neighbors thought the house was going to blow up for sure
7199099 to adjust the asphalt price due to the low bidders refusal to sign the contract plus no other contractor would hold their price throughout the contract
7199100 made an error in his quantity of square yards and also gave an indication that he didnt have certain addendums in other words he just tried to back out of it
7199101 asphalt was paying at 20 a yard it may be 35 a yard now
7199102 i as a manager tried to stop the bleed and find a contractor that would lock in the price
7199103 its an influence thats come about by the oil prices
7199104 they know what the pricing is and they know how many days they can hold that price
7199105 right now the construction industry is still very hungry enough that theyre passing along their costs
7199106 you had to admire the english for putting up with that for almost five years
7199107 we werent ready for that and for a while nobody knew what to do with them
7199108 but somebody picked them up and we got back to work
7199109 sometimes it was hard to tell who your enemies were
7199110 i looked up and there was a beautiful stone church
7199111 and on the wall written with marble letters over a foot high was the verse come unto me you who are heavy laden and i will give you rest that was really a vivid memory
7199112 i didnt know what those boys were going to do
7199113 that was one of the strangest things you ever saw
7199114 it was the absolutely perfect job to match my college training
7199115 since i was the only person in the u s forest service with this particular background i got to travel all over the country wherever state foresters requested that service
7199116 anything else that might affect life or property safety at a particular location
7199117 that is mainly used for people who have medical difficulties at that location
7199118 weve had a few occasions where somebody with a real severe medical problem has been able to call us but not been able to say anything
7199119 its for anybody whos got any reason if there is special information they want emergency responders to know
7199120 just call our administrative number and give us the information and well be glad to put it in there
7199121 i even went and met him and rode through and wrote everything down
7199122 it was so difficult to find his cabin i dont think we could have gotten directions on the phone
7199123 ill do most anything to be sure we can get to your house if something happens to you
7199124 we want business to know were not trying to run their business for them
7199125 we just need this information when something happens its for their protection
7199126 if they want to call well be glad to send them a form
7199127 they want a keyholder in route so they can go in and check the building
7199128 some of them after weve had an incident and we didnt have the information we call them and they still wont fill it out

7199140 arrests and violations of the nfl conduct code has become an unfortunate trend amongst the leagues players

7199142 what do you want to be when you grow up
7199143 issue we hope to help you rediscover the love of teaching that attracted you to this profession in the first place and help you be as inquisitive as the students you teach
7199144 the career you choose may in fact not even have been created yet
7199145 i decided to make a poster with these words emblazened on it to post on several walls at my school
7199146 to formulate problems to organize their knowledge and experiences in new ways to solve them to test their ideas with other students and to express themselves using elaborate statements both orally and in writing
7199147 consistent positive relationship between student exposure to high quality intellectual assignments and students learning gains on the test even after controlling for race socioeconomic class gender and prior achievement differences among classrooms
7199148 constructed response items that require students to produce rather than just select their answers
7199149 this suggests that we should exercise considerable caution in making inferences about student abilities based on paper and pencil handwritten tests as students gain more familiarity with writing via computers
7199150 can portfolios assess student performance and influence instruction the 1991 92 vermont experience
7199151 the percentage of cases in which raters agreed on a score was generally not much higher than expected by chance
7199152 the union city story education reform and technology students performance on standardized tests
7199153 sustained access to network technology at home and at school
7199154 ive become a lot more confident through the work with this program
7199155 i can present ideas without many qualms and ive learned to listen to other peoples ideas
7199156 assessment should be deliberately designed to improve and educate student performance not merely to audit as most school tests currently do
7199157 if assessment is to be a positive force in education it must be implemented properly
7199158 we try to reassure parents but parents do their own research
7199159 if a vaccine is 95 percent effective and you have a lunchroom full of 300 kids that means fifteen of them are susceptible even if they have all been vaccinated
7199160 i believe you cannot separate individual health from public health
7199161 we are at a point where one in five children is learning disabled we cannot say our public health is being served
7199162 immunity gap a growing number of concerned parents exempt children from required shots
7199163 oh they are identical we take great risks at the individual level to treat the masses
7199164 your child wont be able to get into the seventh grade without it
7199165 we find that infants are more compliant in receiving the shot than teenagers
7199166 non ce nessuna ragione per mettere a terra la flotta di md 82 della compagnia
7199167 dobbiamo osservare con attenzione le registrazioni ha detto ma non vediamo nessuna ragione per prendere una misura di questo tipo
7199168 i had to upgrade my package just to see the road games
7199169 it was tough not being able to help my team and by the end of the season there were about five or six other injured guys in my apartment watching with me i knew if i got it eligibility i was going to come back and play i felt like i disappointed the team and duke because i only played one full season
7199170 there are so many worthy seniors on the roster and really any one of them could have been chosen its an honor ill try to lead by example on and off the field
7199171 tielor is probably the most physical kid on the team he likes hitting folks in the mouth and hes extremely smart
7199172 his intensity and effort on the field is one to be admired and our team can follow
7199173 he goes hard every play and he brings the wood behind everything he throws at the defense his engine is nonstop
7199174 im hoping i can be a factor in the passing game as well its always nice getting your hands on the ball
7199175 theres no better feeling than playing before our crowd at night to start the season i cant wait
7199176 its football and guys get hurt all the time theyre an injured ankle or whatever away from getting playing time they just have to be ready when the chance comes
7199177 tielor and i have a good relationship because some people say you got a bodyguard
7199178 tielor is like a bodyguard when the blitz comes he picks it up
7199179 its time to go hit someone else coach is proven he knows what hes doing and hopefully we can turn the corner this is my final season and im hoping to make the most of it
7199180 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
7199181 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
7199182 where is our guru he must be enjoying he must have been given all the joys that only heaven can provide
7199183 guru deva o great master i always knew that you were the greatest master now i am seeing with my own eyes god is so pleased with you he has given you sophia loren as a reward
7199184 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7199185 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7199186 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7199187 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7199188 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7199189 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7199190 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7199191 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7199192 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7199193 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7199194 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7199195 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7199196 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7199197 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7199198 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7199199 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7199200 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure

7199219 the trojans wondered why the great wooden horse had been left behind and there were some who considered that it had been left there as an offering to the goddess pallas athene and they thought it should be brought within the city others were wiser and would have left the wooden horse alone but those who considered that it should be brought within prevailed and as the horse was too great to bring through the gate they flung down part of the wall that they might bring it through the wooden horse was brought within the walls and left upon the streets of the city and the darkness of the night fell

7199233 british pupils ignorance about the basic facts of d day probably reflected recent educational trends to move away from
7199234 clearly john roughan has an axe to grind when he states at the end
7199235 it sounds like he knows the book has failed in the end eves bite is no more than the authors bile

7199275 eram tantas as comemora es de anivers rios que quase todo fim de semana tinha festa na casa de um filho at que come aram as reclama es ningu m conseguia ter qualquer outra atividade social al m de apagar velinha
7199276 sempre gostei de casa cheia quando era jovem meu marido olhava para toda aquela crian ada deitada no ch o vendo tv e dizia com orgulho que nem parecia verdade que eram nossas
7199277 n o foram raras as vezes em que meu marido levou as crian as para a escola e ao chegar ao trabalho percebeu que havia sobrado uma dormindo no banco traseiro da kombi
7199278 n o podemos nos comportar como novos ricos e sair por a torrando o dinheiro
7199279 a id ia carimbar os recursos para evitar o desperd cio
7199280 acho essa proposta excelente porque j que vamos arrecadar mais h necessidade de investimentos na rea social
7199281 a reparti o deve ser feita com outros estados e munic pios e n o apenas com aqueles que t m po o
7199282 h munic pios que se locupletam com os royalties mas n o usam um centavo em benef cio da popula o

7199284 cedo para dizer que o mercado de trabalho est esfriando
7199285 toda a produ o da f brica de oxford estava comprometida como o brasil um pa s de grande potencial de vendas n o quer amos iniciar a importa o sem a certeza de atender demanda
7199286 o pa s tem classe privilegiada potencial compradora do nosso produto
7199287 trabalhamos com produtos especiais aqueles que as montadoras n o oferecem
7199288 al m desse desperd cio existe a enorme perda de tempo de tantos projetos que ao serem levados san o do prefeito s o vetados por inconstitucionais
7199289 um problema mais amplo no brasil inteiro o poder executivo invadiu as fun es do legislativo
7199290 e isso se agrava com o baix ssimo grau de politiza o desses eleitos
7199291 aqui o voto sempre aberto e projetos importantes foram aprovados
7199292 quem circula pela periferia sabe que dar nome a uma rua uma das reivindica es principais dos moradores
7199293 para come ar passa por uma revis o do plano diretor e pelo debate de um novo c digo de obras e edifica es
7199294 para chamar o executivo a uma discuss o mais eficaz
7199295 o guido sofreu o que sofreu e parece que s foi um solu o

7199300 n o se fez discrimina o de nada mas pensou se antes de qualquer coisa na qualidade da programa o
7199301 produzir ficou muito caro e se o agricultor n o acompanhar de perto o risco de perda muito grande
7199302 o resultado s foi alcan ado porque o agricultor soube absorver e aplicar as inova es
7199303 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7199304 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees
7199305 right now the polygraph is the best tool they have at their hands but its not a tool thats without problems
7199306 efetivamente s vamos combater o nepotismo quando houver uma queda substancial no quadro de cargos de confian a
7199307 um campo f rtil para a troca de favores porque n o define o que p blico do que privado
7199308 o que acontece sombra desse modelo que se apropriam de um bem p blico como se fosse uma propriedade particular
7199309 n o h justificativa para esse n mero t o elevado de comissionados
7199310 come amos a acompanhar a movimenta o de nomea es e constatamos que aqueles exonerados do judici rio estavam arrumando coloca o no legislativo
7199311 o famoso nepotismo cruzado quem estava no gabinete de deputados come ou a migrar para o judici rio
7199312 denunciamos todos os casos e 10 atos de nomea o tiveram que ser anulados o cnj determinou presid ncia do tribunal de justi a na poca que exonerasse todos os servidores procedentes do legislativo
7199313 o problema que muito dif cil manter esse controle porque na maioria das vezes os benefici rios podem n o ter o mesmo sobrenome da autoridade que os acolhe a pessoa tem um cunhado que n o tem seu sobrenome e manda para o tribunal de contas se n o tem o mesmo sobrenome como vai ser poss vel fazer a identifica o dos protegidos
7199314 o que temos que fazer enxugar nos tr s poderes o n mero de cargos de livre provimento
7199315 a s mula uma coisa muito boa mas a grande quest o s o os cargos comissionados em n mero excessivo para algumas autoridades terem ali o caminho da livre nomea o em alguns locais esse mecanismo pode se tornar uma moeda de troca h abusos
7199316 o nepotismo cruzado vedado mas de fato existe uma maior dificuldade na identifica o dessa troca de favores que s vezes n o n tida
7199317 se for necess rio vamos agir para manter a paz social
7199318 assegurando o direito dos ndios garantidos pela constitui o federal
7199319 se o supremo fizer isso vai rasgar a constitui o
7199320 se for contr rio ao que defendemos ficaremos insatisfeitos mas vamos acatar

7199327 essa gera o merecia muito depois de tantos momentos dif ceis como o pan
7199328 n s nos dedicamos abdicamos de muita coisa e trabalhamos demais para chegar at aqui
7199329 o ambiente foi um dos fatores que mais pesou na hora da compra
7199330 a experi ncia na fran a me influenciou l se trabalha em lugares pequenos e se n o houver organiza o o servi o ineficiente
7199331 uma terapia quando preparo meus pratos esque o do mundo

7199333 est vamos em uma casa em campos do jord o todo mundo ia cidade e ele preferia ficar cozinhando
7199334 eu ficava at de madrugada no fog o simplesmente pelo prazer de cozinhar
7199335 os livros me inspiram mas n o sigo risca gosto de adaptar uma receita
7199336 quando vi o im vel montado minha vontade era de me mudar na hora ele era exatamente como eu queria
7199337 foi amor primeira vista depois que vi aquele decorado eu j me imaginava morando
7199338 o ser humano muito visual e o decorado consegue criar sensa es ao visit lo a pessoa consegue enxergar o quanto aquele lugar pode ser um espa o para morar bem
7199339 como o projeto j se enquadrava dentro do que eu buscava s precisei realizar algumas pequenas altera es
7199340 a nica exce o se d nos apartamentos de alt ssimo padr o onde a constru o de um modelo decorado custaria muito caro
7199341 em um apartamento decorado de alto padr o costumamos investir uma m dia de r 300 mil entre a contrata o da decoradora a mob lia e os acabamentos
7199342 esses espa os ajudam a tornar tang vel aquilo que invis vel o que de grande relev ncia j que o cliente s receber o produto pronto daqui h algum tempo
7199343 dif cil fazer a pessoa enxergar as possibilidades daquele espa o apenas vendo plantas e perspectivas
7199344 visitar o decorado como fazer um test drive em um carro voc consegue sentir como a ilumina o o p direito etc coisas dif ceis de se ilustrar at em um tour virtual
7199345 o comprador vem com os filhos e todos conseguem ter a sensa o de como morar ali
7199346 o grande volume de vendas que registramos se d de acordo com a quantidade de potenciais clientes que os corretores conseguem trazer para o estande
7199347 por isso tentamos criar apartamentos dos sonhos que encantem os clientes

7199351 procurei por um ano e n o encontrava nada que me agradasse acho que porque n o tenho tempo e paci ncia para ficar cuidando de projetos compra de m veis
7199352 era justamente o que eu precisava e a decora o de bom gosto
7199353 geralmente n s instru mos a pessoa que vai vender ou colocar o im vel para loca o a deixar os m veis
7199354 ter uma decora o bonita e m veis novos apenas ajuda na velocidade com que o im vel vendido
7199355 nesses casos recomendamos a negocia o do im vel sem a mob lia

7199509 well its the launch of the western australian campaign thats precisely what its about
7199510 its about colin barnett and the liberal team in western australia making sure that they take it well and truly up to mr carpenter over the next two weeks
7199511 ive got nothing to say beyond what ive already said
7199512 oh the four corners program well i watch all kinds of television all the time
7199513 the important thing here is that its important that the government prepare and release an economic statement our economy is slowing very sharply
7199514 weve got plummeting business and consumer confidence the reserve bank is forecasting inflation at five per cent in december and the economy has slowed to two per cent growth by the end of the year
7199515 the single most important thing we will be focused on this week is the fact that australians are worse off under mr rudd than they were under the coalition last year
7199516 this has been an unprecedented opportunity for western australia and they labor have wasted it
7199517 they have damaged the reputation of this state both nationally and internationally
7199518 if a liberal government is elected and i find myself as the premier of western australia education will be our highest priority
7199519 every child every boy and girl deserves the best possible education that we can provide for them
7199520 well its the launch of the western australian campaign thats precisely what its about
7199521 its about colin barnett and the liberal team in western australia making sure that they take it well and truly up to mr carpenter
7199522 the hills are actually a play on the name hillary but of course they cant but help make us think of the mountains that he loved and of course the scaling of everest
7199523 its lovely that its in a place thats very much visited like st marys and i think people will see it as a great tribute to ed that its here in his home town and a lot of people can view it
7199524 it was a very simple ceremony receiving the banner from st georges chapel in windsor into the church here and it looks highly appropriate seeing it in that setting
7199525 when the game was in the balance that first 40 minutes 10 15 minutes out from halftime i think he failed the test again
7199526 i think his kicking game on two or three occasions they were poor
7199527 he needs to get it right in the tight situations if hes going to improve and take manly to the next step
7199528 at times the kicking game was fantastic but a couple of times there last night when the game was tight i think he failed
7199529 i think matts form has been great the last few weeks
7199530 a hundred per cent i know we can win it with ox
7199531 everyone can have their two bobs worth but were more than happy with the team weve got
7199532 were second on the ladder theres always people knocking us or whatever that suits us
7199533 its shattering to think that we dropped our heads and didnt play for our season which is exactly what it was
7199534 to address the topics which are the most important and hardest issues for serbia political extremism nationalism war crimes the kosovo problem corruption and a number of serbian cultural and social myths
7199535 let richard try to justify and defend his friends to us the fact that he knows serbia through the exit festival is like loving japan because of sony tvs
7199536 ive just read your article and there is just one crucial thing that i dont agree with the premise that european union really wants serbia i even agree with that canadian politician that belgrade is a sewer it is just necessary to notice that besides the tons of serbian shit here there is also plenty of western shit our misfortune is that both those sides enjoy the smell of their shit a lot
7199537 if men are men there will be enough space for everyone who lives in kosovo but if men are not men the entire planet will not be big enough for only two men like it was in the times of cain and abel
7199538 were changing our processes to be leaner and stronger and this is about how you manage brands in the future
7199539 historically we have all looked to traditional competitors but the space is broader than that now where we will win is where there is high influence in communities as opposed to the old way of just measuring against the old competitive set

7199564 when someone starts something new like a new medicine after a new diagnosis they inevitably have to put other things aside but usually these were things they loved or enjoyed so despite the best of intentions two things occur frustration and a need for hope the short term and the long term interestingly enough the person or persons who actually help that person at those early stages deal with their frustrations can also offer hope of sticking with it and that sense of hope can keep people going

7199632 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7199633 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others

7199636 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7199637 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7199638 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7199639 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7199640 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7199641 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7199642 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7199643 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7199644 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7199645 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s

7199647 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7199648 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them

7199655 i dont want to use the word fearless but she is a courageous person of course theres apprehension and she did speak about that but she never really used the term fear
7199656 she said she was drawn to the passion of the people who were in these zones in other words if youre in a zone of conflict nothing is taken for granted and you live each moment like it was a lifetime of experience
7199657 she is an intelligent caring and adventurous professional who was well aware of the dangers of the regions she frequented
7199658 she was also aware that her audience was keenly interested in her world perspective and she worked bravely to bring them that perspective
7199659 we can all cut our energy use in our homes by half while staying completely comfortable
7199660 that would have a tremendous impact on how many new coal plants we have to build which would dramatically reduce our emissions in the state of kansas
7199661 i encourage everybody to really think about what comes across your desk because there is a lot of misinformation
7199662 what many people have been suggesting lately is that we begin to think differently
7199663 instead of talking about miles per gallon we need to talk about gallons per mile thats a much more productive way to think about that
7199664 gulen gave a new decree and a new kind of mobilization to assimilate kurds and to steal their minds by injecting religious ideology and by causing them to sell their birthright

7199666 g ney currently a rabbi at the jacobs house jewish community center in toronto praised ergenekon prosecutor zekeriya z for having
7199667 however they are very close to the end and i think it is very difficult moving on further from this point there is no power in turkey that can stop ergenekon
7199668 when we gain him we will be more powerful in the eyes of fethullah g len

7199742 facing expectations of parents wanting us to retain our culture and the pressures of society to integrate leaves many of us in a confused state to our identities
7199743 often not used to living with people of other cultures
7199744 the country was also historically influenced by confucianism and holds a military set of ideologies which may not be applicable in a western society like new zealand
7199745 in a divorce a korean woman does not have equal property rights even if her husband had wronged her in the marriage
7199746 so it can be shocking when korean men find out how many rights and how much power the women have in new zealand
7199747 imaging the community newspapers cyberspace and the non construction of korean new zealand identity
7199748 although many kowis may disagree in both senses i do see surprising parallels in the above with the long term western expat community in korea especially those married to koreans we also have feet in both korea and our home countries and a lot of assumptions are made about us by koreans based on our different appearances usually ones that stress rather than try to overcome differences between us i could go on about the incredulity disdain and mocking ive regularly encountered while i was learning korean too which was extremely demotivating but my point is that this too is surmountable with effort but given our circumstances and our usually bilingual partners then it is all too easy to simply hang out with other westerners watch english language tv and chat away to relatives on the internet many days koreans seem to almost encourage this which is im sure how many asians feel of pakeha maori and pacific islanders in new zealand too

7199758 now as to the present situation of the american federation of musicians or rather the situation in the ranks of our membership or in the ranks of our field of employment i say that we must adapt ourselves to changed conditions if there was ever a time when it was absolutely imperative to do so the time is here now
7199759 start with a cocktail party and dinners for some of the chosen and present almost nothing of substance or value to the local officers
7199760 if in the unlikely event she is supporting tom lee then i would urge delegates to not vote for her or anyone else doing so because to support tom lee and have him win is doom for our union

7199762 these beads are wonderful for adding dimension and pizazz use them to highlight areas on your card or scrapbook page that you want to stand out theyre simple to use just place an adhesive where you want the beads and sprinkle the beads over the adhesive
7199763 increase the afms activity with the afl cio address the problem of runaway productions broaden the afms involvement in legislative matters in washington dc provide additional services and benefits for freelance musicians and increase visibility for the federation throughout the us and canada
7199764 i think it is up to the leadership of this union to create an atmosphere where musicians are proud of the work they do and dont apologize for wanting to be paid a decent wage for that work musicians needs and wants are the same as every other worker in america and canada
7199765 fundamental to a unions responsibility is the representation of its members the afms representation of its members results in responsibilities to three groups the locals the federation and the members while each have separate obligations all three groups work together to ensure that representation of the members interests is as effective as possible
7199766 it cannot be overemphasized that one of the most essential components of effective representation is input from members it is the members who ultimately work under the agreements thus they know best about their working conditions it is not unusual for musicians to disagree on what the national standards should be it is vital however that each member throughout the us and canada has the right through their local to provide input into negotiations that ultimately may affect them this helps create a better understanding between all parties fostering inclusive contributions rather than excluding participants leads to greater solidarity
7199767 as with any union member representation in the afm is a complex process but i believe that this complexity is a good thing it ensures that democracy is strong by involving all parties in negotiations and the development of new member services if the opposite happened i e locals negotiating without any input from their members or the federation then afm members would lose in the end because their negotiators would not be armed with the most resources and best tools possible it is my belief that as communication continues to grow and becomes stronger than ever the afms representation of its members will become more effective than previously imagined
7199768 i cannot emphasize enough how seriously i accept the responsibility of serving as your president i look forward to working with local officers and player conference officers representing all segments of our membership i urge everyone to work together accepting that there will be differences but addressing those differences in a cordial and respectful manner we must build trust based on our flexibility and understand that everyone bringing something to the table is doing so for what they view as the good of the organization if we develop relationships based on respect this organization will benefit and so will our members

7199780 but we are expecting the icc to postpone and reschedule it for a later date

7199800 the market as a whole has been a little weakish that has come as a result of the housing market problems and the mortgage industry meltdown
7199801 a lot of people are finding themselves in a position of reduced affordability and that has had an impact not just on us but across the industry
7199802 when you rely too much on incentives and on daily rentals you trash your residual value
7199803 we forced the market by jamming too many into the daily rental companies
7199804 we found out we would never win this thing unless we backed off on this policy of forcing the market

7199819 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7199820 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7199821 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7199822 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7199823 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7199824 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7199825 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7199826 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7199827 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7199828 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7199829 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7199830 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7199831 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7199832 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7199833 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution

7199837 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7199838 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7199839 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7199840 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience

7199844 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7199845 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7199846 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7199847 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7199848 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll

7199865 when the prosecution is able to establish its case by acceptable evidence though in part the accused can be convicted even if the co accused have been acquitted on the ground that the evidence led was not sufficient to fasten guilt on them

7199877 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no

7199879 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7199880 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7199881 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7199882 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7199883 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption

7199891 considering that jamaica had more slavery rebellion than any country in the world
7199892 its not a question of genetic pool but we have that
7199893 its a cultural thing too that we want to achieve
7199894 i think that he knows full well that his athletes have been using drugs
7199895 he set out to set up a lab to cheat they caught him he went to prison and now hes casting aspersions on other people who have stayed in this sport the last 40 years and have been clean
7199896 from 1948 until now we have been coming to the olympics in sprints ok and we have done well this is just a culmination of what has gone on for more than 40 years
7199897 which is difficult to translate exactly but could be said to mean though we may be small we are powerful beyond expectations
7199898 at the end of the day though there is a culture of track that the jamaicans have now mastered at a very high level
7199899 if usain bolt were born in north america or europe he would be now earning far more money as a professional basketball player with the odds of a much longer and more lucrative career
7199900 once upon a time they were saying we have it because we have fast fibers
7199901 so i said to them how many countries have fast fibers only a few areas in the world ah these are theories that dont hold strong when you have a complex situation
7199902 we passed exams at universities abroad because of the strength where other blacks failed
7199903 we feel because other people are now caught the playing field is now more level for us
7199904 all of them trained in the states and we caught them down in kingston
7199905 you remember that guy who believed in god so strongly
7199906 our athletes are strong believers in the almighty they believe that without the almighty they can do nothing and with the almighty they actually can do everything
7199907 we know that our athletes have trained hard that the country would not tolerate any kind of cheating because we are a moral christian country
7199908 hey lets share with the people what i think of the game
7199909 i want to get through this level as fast as possible on my second time through
7199910 yeah id drink that i dont know jack all about his games but ill drink whatever hes schilling
7199911 whoa an energy tank cool remember that one in the tree in mega man 2
7199912 we dont anticipate large scale raids here in our district because we dont really have the industry known for hiring illegal immigrants that suggests this sort of thing will happen here
7199913 but we do want to support principals in cases where the legal guardian has been detained and deported
7199914 if they are sole caregivers a decision is made whether these people can be released or are going to have to be held
7199915 we go through extraordinary means to ensure children are not left home alone or left alone at school
7199916 this is relatively new to a lot of school districts
7199917 i dont think its a topic of discussion at the lunch table but as you imagine it is very upsetting when it happens to any of your students

7199921 we have sufficient strength of crpf to assist the local police but we are bringing in additional reinforcements
7199922 a stunning beauty almost too good to be true adriennas thai hawaiian javanese heritage makes her a very sexy exotic yet intriguing choice my eagerness to seduce and retreat you goes beyond the average as i set the mood tease you with strawberries and champagne and move so perfectly the ultimate choice for the very selective but appreciative gentleman my body language speaks volumes as my own language arouses your senses standing at 54
7199923 it wasnt clean tonight i guess my worries came true we see the end result how good it can be if we clean this up
7199924 i felt more at ease in the huddle more at ease on the field i felt more like myself
7199925 if the u s government allows fannie and freddie to fail and international investors are not compensated adequately the consequences will be catastrophic
7199926 if it is not the end of the world it is the end of the current international financial system
7199927 the seriousness of such failures could be beyond the stretch of peoples imagination
7199928 i think its very dangerous and its a sign that people are very frightened
7199929 at a time in which finance companies are holding questionable assets and facing losses regulators typically require more capital not less
7199930 we are nearly the only game in town and we think we are going to be able to enjoy that position for a number of years
7199931 if you have a bazooka in your pocket and people know it you probably wont have to use it
7199932 preferred will also see a lot of pain but that is up in the air because a lot of banks own the preferred you put a lot of banks in trouble if you just wipe out the preferred also
7199933 it is in truth not for glory nor riches nor honours that we are fighting but for freedom for that alone which no honest man gives up but with life itself
7199934 primero nos motan una crisis econ mica y ahora esto todo para fastidiarnos las vacaciones
7199935 an grey of fans act sound cattleman hats and boas waited nearly digit hours for madonnas concert to intend low way erupting into screams at the prototypal strain candy shop
7199936 is your sales team trained learn how to excel at retail sales this two part workshop
7199937 dieses internat steht und f llt mit seinem ruf hier wird bildung nicht nur vermittelt sondern verkauft
7199938 theyre not worried about their health care theyre not worried about these issues that weve put on the news
7199939 instead of saying i support obama because of his views on free trade agreements too many young people say they like him because they think hell make the economy fair
7199940 but if you ask them to explain what that would mean theyre at a loss
7199941 they had the piano i was supposed to play on a flat bed pickup truck and i went off to get some taffy or something while i was gone the guy with the pickup truck drove the piano away from the stage about 100 feet away and then went off to ride the ferris wheel for some reason we had a bass guitar there which id never played in my life and i wound up playing bass
7199942 i swear there were 900 people there in the stands it was 10 years before i played to a bigger crowd than that and we were awful
7199943 i really looked at it as being more of a new beginning
7199944 i wanted to recontextualize all that music because you have all these songs scattered over a lot of albums some of them done 10 years ago
7199945 what i liked about the new cd is heres some of the best stuff ive got were going to clean it up and make it sound as good as it can sound i got to revisit quite a number of songs that i wasnt happy with on the first go around and get them just where i wanted them i felt that finally my stuff got the right treatment
7199946 the best year for me career wise in a long time
7199947 the reason i have enough songs to have a greatest hits cd is because i was able to keep going even though i wasnt selling a lot of records a lot of musicians never learn that because they have to have a label to make things happen
7199948 im not sorry i had to learn how to stand on my own two feet and keep my thing going because i got to keep playing and a lot of my friends didnt
7199949 i am the end of time i am the black core of smiling whores whose fake love is so good you cry while they laugh and you beg while they torture and you forgive them even as they murder you dead i am the sender of all bad things that you sent for and changed your precious little mind i am the dawn of the all night wide awake thinking i would not come i am independence pushed to empire and tyranny and the same as it was before i changed it i am the beginning of time i am the crack of the atmosphere the spring in nothing that flows something and everything into nothing like blue on black and sunshine and time time endless time that is fleeting as it stales and ironic so straight faced and lying i make and i take what i make as it is mine and i have come for it i am the abuse the wretched abuse of self and other and mother and brother and father of naught sister begot of bastard son of none and all the dumb found by me enlightened call me titan
7199950 but when you put on this uniform thats whats expected its not we hope you live up to the tradition youre expected to
7199951 with the transition date approaching we want to do whatever we can to help educate people about their options
7199952 the facebook application and our microsite will reach out to new audiences with this message encouraging young people to make sure they are ready for dtv and to help family and friends who have not yet prepared
7199953 i stood at the doctors side and watched him perform a partial birth abortion on a woman who was six months pregnant
7199954 we didnt really imagine the kind of growth that we could achieve
7199955 you dont need a huge infrastructure to win an election
7199956 you do need that kind of infrastructure to change the country to overcome the huge special interests and have the creativity and boldness to do big important things
7199957 imitation is a sincere form of flattery we appreciate it even when those of a different ideological persuasion imitate us
7199958 they cant come up with five crisp statements based on the founding of this country to explain their philosophy
7199959 government shouldnt be telling any man or any woman when they should and shouldnt start their families
7199960 yeah i was suckered heard the news on nightline last night and at the moment sat 11 45 am still no text message
7199961 as friday evening turned into night it became apparent that the campaign was going to run into sequencing and logistics problems sure the campaign could wait to send the message minutes before the nominee took the stage at the old state capitol in springfield ill but that ignored the fact that the nominee had to get to springfield and with the media camped out in front of each of their houses how exactly were they going to do that without getting noticed
7199962 from a tech point of view the mass text message seems to have failed
7199963 but from an earned media standpoint and an organizing standpoint the mass text experiment looks pretty successful three million names is phenomenal especially if they can now segment them by zip code
7199964 if he loved me he wouldnt do that to me
7199965 que se resumen en que la informaci n y su movimiento no se valoran econ micamente

7199968 the research will fill important gaps and progress knowledge to inform prevention programs
7199969 the research projects will examine the management of middle ear disease and hearing loss in aboriginal children up to five years old target school age children and young people with prevention education and identify enablers and barriers to the use of hearing protection in the workplace
7199970 hearing loss costs the australian community about 11 75 billion a year
7199971 the hearing loss prevention program tackles the burden of preventable hearing loss in the australian community and targets young people aboriginal and torres strait islander people and people in the workplace
7199972 this week provides an opportunity for people to get information about services available and free hearing screenings at many hearing centres across the nation
7199973 note the winner manadous 2 beat kick vs others 4 beat what an energy conserver
7199974 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7199975 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7199976 the kind of fighter who i want by my side
7199977 the hills are actually a play on the name hillary but of course they cant but help make us think of the mountains that he loved and of course the scaling of everest
7199978 its lovely that its in a place thats very much visited like st marys and i think people will see it as a great tribute to ed that its here in his home town and a lot of people can view it
7199979 im relatively confident that were going to be contenders in the north
7199980 id be surprised if we dont win yeah we have a lot of new faces but i think were coming back with a deeper roster
7199981 his soccer mind is one of the best ive ever coached hell probably lead us in goals
7199982 almost everything that we will do is going to go through him he is going to be asked to hold down the middle and spread the ball around
7199983 he will play behind everybody and anchor what i feel will be one of the best defenses in the league
7199984 hes real strong in the air and doesnt give up too many opportunities
7199985 we had six guys try out for the spot and theyre all new well probably carry three through the season theres some young talent there and were just looking for that one guy who can step up and fill those hero shoes for us
7199986 i think well be more solid on defense than last year
7199987 we cant allow a lot of shots and we need to maintain possession losing abdulwali is big because he was our leading scorer and the north mvp so the question will be whether we can score at the same rate we did last year
7199988 but this team has so much talent and so much depth we are talented one through 20
7199989 i think the early success of the mens program does puts some pressure on the women
7199990 but so far everybody has been supportive they understand this is a first year program our hopes obviously are to build as consistent a team as the boys have become
7199991 our first challenge has been getting the word out that we even had a program
7199992 its kind of been a grass roots word of mouth process weve talked to a lot of local coaches and players but we found that most of the players of that age group were already travelling somewhere else to play finding local players has been really difficult for us this year
7199993 we have some players that can definitely step in and play the position and we have a line on a couple others and well hopefully convince one or two to come out
7199994 she cant wait to get back on the field competitively
7199995 she will definitely be one of our most effective offensive players shes fast shes strong and shes good with the ball
7199996 shes a really good ball handler and will be a team leader for us
7199997 we have got two or three offensive powerhouses who are going to score some goals for us but i think we are deeper defensively
7199998 everybody is coming in from all these different backgrounds and it will take us a while to have everybody find their role on this team but once we get a couple of games under our belt i expect us to start getting sharp we have some pretty talented individuals on this team once we start playing games i know we have enough firepower to be competitive with the other teams in this league
7199999 the games that we lost we really werent completely out of
