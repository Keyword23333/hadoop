5060028 it exposed an area that the city had never looked at this comprehensively when we looked at it we found a lot of areas that could be improved

5060061 no quiero ir al colegio con la t a mala
5060062 nunca pens que se trataba de un abuso reci n ahora me doy cuenta que deb denunciarla porque ella ten a 20 a os y yo era un ni o
5060063 uno de los factores de protecci n de este tipo de delitos es que muchos lo ven como un rito de iniciaci n
5060064 es posible pensar que este tema demora en ser revelado por los menores porque estamos en una cultura donde se espera que siempre el agresor sea hombre
5060065 en el cavas tambi n hemos tenido casos de lactantes abusados pero la mayor a de las v ctimas tienen desde cinco o seis a os que es cuando comienzan a hablar las agresoras siempre son adultas
5060066 siempre se trata de una relaci n de poder y la victimaria abusa de eso no es una relaci n normal de cari o ellas pueden presionar con diversas estrategias como regalos mejorar las notas o dar plata a las v ctimas
5060067 en este ltimo caso se trata de mujeres que son obligadas a sumarse a una situaci n de abuso
5060068 la ley s lo se refiere a la penetraci n es decir s lo puede ser cometida por un hombre
5060069 que una mujer toque a un ni o y le provoque una erecci n es tan grave por su perjuicio sicol gico como una violaci n decir que s lo el hombre est habilitado para el acceso carnal es lo que se debe cambiar en la legislaci n
5060070 en chile en materia de homicidio la mujer estaba desprotegida y muchos est n tratando de tipificarlo como femicidio pero en materia sexual un menor hombre est desprotegido ante una mujer adulta hay que interpretar otras cosas
5060071 tengo la sensaci n de que hay un tema cultural detr s de estas situaciones de c mo debe ser el hombre respecto al sexo
5060072 hay que verlo caso a caso es muy importante poner atenci n a cu l ha sido el escenario obvio que un ni o abusado por una mujer puede tener rollos con las mujeres cuando grande por eso es fundamental una terapia de reparaci n
5060073 estamos hablando de una figura altamente significativa en la vida de un menor de alguna manera deja estragos en l es un proyectil directo a su mente es una figura en la cual el ni o est confiando
5060074 esta situaci n tiene que ser apoyada con especialistas hay que ver c mo redefinir y enmendar este hecho en su mente en la familia hay que hablarlo con cautela con respeto hay que tocarlo de tal forma de que se pueda revertir en forma sana sin duda que la exposici n medi tica de sus vidas y sus historias no ayudan en esto
5060075 hay elementos que utiliz la madre de la ni a que fueron sumados como testimonio del delito adem s la conducta de la menor era claramente la de una ni a abusada
5060076 yo comenc a notar primero algunas conductas raras de mi hijo estaba s per agresivo violento hasta que un d a me grit que yo no lo cuidaba que no lo proteg a de su t a erika de qu me est s hablando le pregunt s poh ella me toca y me pide que le toque los pechos me grit enfurecido
5060077 hablamos con mi hermana la encaramos y se defendi diciendo que a mi hijo le gusta llamar la atenci n que es mentiroso y yo qued al medio no sab a c mo actuar quer a abrazarlo pero tambi n ten a rabia t no entiendes le echaba la culpa un poco a l y tambi n yo me echaba la culpa
5060078 l me dijo que mi hermana hab a abusado del ni o en varias oportunidades y que no hab a sido tan simple que incluso ella trat de consumar el acto sexual con el benjam n yo no sab a qu hacer y el sic logo me dijo que si yo no hac a la denuncia entonces la hac a l
5060079 tambi n me dijo que mi hermana no hab a sido la nica en abusar de mi hijo cuenta daisy benjam n tambi n describi c mo el vecino lo hab a tocado un par de veces
5060080 mi hermano era s per garabatero y trataba muy mal a mi hijo
5060081 qued embarazada de otra pareja y cuando tuve a mi hija decid irme de esa casa reci n ahora que mi hijo tiene 12 a os denunci a mi hermana ha sido duro porque ella todav a no sabe est presa por narcotr fico cumpliendo una condena de cinco a os yo la voy a ver igual porque soy cristiana y ninguna persona tiene derecho a juzgar a otra pero no s c mo va a reaccionar cuando se entere que puede venir otra condena esta vez por abuso

5060085 you know hes got a lot longer track record than that
5060086 hes a legendary entrepreneur and you know one of the things that i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy
5060087 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5060088 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5060089 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5060090 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5060091 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5060092 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5060093 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5060094 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5060095 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5060096 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5060097 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5060098 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5060099 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5060100 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5060101 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5060102 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5060103 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5060104 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5060105 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5060106 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5060107 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5060108 help to ensure nobody with potential is overlooked before they are given the chance to show their strengths at interview and compete for admission alongside other candidates

5060117 the uab university of alabama at birmingham spam data mine is seeing new escalations in the so called russian georgian cyber war more than 500 e mails were received in a 90 minutes period this morning at uab claiming to be a bbc story
5060118 hackers targeting georgia in the midst of its conflict with russia have started sending out a new batch of malicious spam messages apparently with the aim of building a new botnet network of remote controlled computers the poorly worded messages started going out early friday morning and now make up close to 5 of the spam traffic measured by the university of alabama at birminghams spam data mine
5060119 the estonian foreign ministry has confirmed that it is sending two of its leading cyber defense experts to tbilisi to help stave off cyber attacks emanating in russia
5060120 they started out as some fairly small attacks and as the hostilities got bigger and bigger we are now seeing some rather large attacks while the attacks are probably being launched by russia we have no evidence to prove they are coming from the russian government themselves those attacks helped take down government web sites in georgia including that of the president even replacing it with the image seen in this video clip
5060121 we brought the georgia presidential site into our data center and our servers we are broadcasting three tv stations out of here and we also brought over another web site rustavi2 the largest tv network
5060122 the conflict between russia and the former soviet republic of georgia has underscored the relative anonymity of cyberattackers
5060123 dr david betz senior lecturer at the department of war studies of kings college london said were still in the wooden biplane era of cyber war
5060124 today defence strategists recognise the full importance of computer networks where before carrier pigeons were shot out of the sky or jamming signals rendered radio communication impossible telecom centres and internet servers have become the prime targets and in 2007 estonia won the dubious honour of being the first obvious victim of a coordinated cyber attack by russian hackers
5060125 while internet attacks continue in georgia security experts say the u s is not prepared for similar attacks that could steal confidential data and wreak havoc on u s computer systems
5060126 the internet was not designed to be secure its architecture was developed by a relatively small group of researchers who knew and trusted one another they didnt envision the net becoming intertwined with commerce manufacturing and the power grid all of which are now to some degree vulnerable to cyber warriors the ultimate solution is to redesign the net striking a better balance between security and the free flow of information in the meantime georgias experience serves as a warning to internet users that war has been redefined to the detriment of civilians everywhere
5060127 i saw someone spin randy turner from the lead saw scott mulkern get sideways and then my car was totaled in the fronstretch wall
5060128 the caution before mulkern clearly dumped gene green and they put green back and i asked the flagman if they were going to put mulkern to the back too
5060129 it expletive sucks the pass drivers i dont know who drives that no 10 but theyre supposed to be the professionals what the expletive were already qualified theres no need to drive like that
5060130 he told me you dont want to bring that new car there the first day and he was right
5060131 actually it was about getting in the race today and once we got in the back of the pack it was about getting to fourth and then when it all came unglued at the front it was the astle family glue that stuck together
5060132 on those restarts knowlton was leaning on my right rear quarter panel i didnt appreciate it but some guys race that way
5060133 we were leading the race i dont know if mulkern got us or knowlton just turned too hard i dont know it was just a wild race

5060137 this is shocking we decided to file the rti when we saw parents unable to admit their seriously ill children at aiims while children of some other poor and illiterate families were being kept in the hospital needlessly for a long time
5060138 aiims said in its reply that families of patients are given social counselling before trials are started with most patients in aiims being illiterate and belonging to extremely poor families i doubt if they even understand what a clinical trial is and what their children are being subjected to
5060139 all the deaths cant be attributed to the trials some patients were suffering from conditions in which mortality was the normal outcome and we were trying to see whether a drug could improve the situation some other trials didnt even use medications they involved behavioural methods like nursing care
5060140 trials in aiims are conducted under strict protocol and every step is scrutinized through faculty presentations and data safety management groups before ethical clearances are received
5060141 wanting to get married and not going online will soon be seen as equivalent to trying to find an address by driving around randomly rather than using a map

5060162 the situation was clarified after a community meeting in bokfontein near brits on saturday
5060163 both were pay or play deals its a measure of how deeply the producers despised me that they chose to pay off my full salary in effect paying me not to write
5060164 i was diagnosed with add twice i didnt believe the first doctor who told me and i had a whole theory that add was just something they invented to make you pay for medicine but then the second doctor told me i had it
5060165 i guess i was in denial i dont understand exactly what it is the symptoms seem to apply to everyone around me in the industry loss of memory starting something and not finishing it
5060166 the reception issues began immediately with 3g flip flopping between no signal and up to four bars but usually hovering between none and two
5060167 it amazes me how widespread this problem obviously is and how little at amp t and especially apple has done in acknowledging and addressing this issue
5060168 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
5060169 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users
5060170 some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
5060171 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion

5060179 the research shows programs that are abstinence only are not successful the budget will not have funding for abstinence only programs if the people look at the research the answer is pretty clear
5060180 the governor supports abstinence based education but the governor wants to see us funding programs that are evidence based
5060181 i dont need to respond to what some republicans say all i need to do is be an effective governor
5060182 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5060183 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5060184 the iranian media is mistaken it was the launch of a rocket capable of carrying a satellite the omid satellite was not launched itself
5060185 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5060186 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians

5060198 and when you lose your sense of smell and taste you cant distinguish the three flavors of jelly
5060199 some people are just emotionally distraught when they realize they are going to lose people they love liberties that they hold very dear like driving a car

5060213 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5060214 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5060215 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5060216 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5060217 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5060218 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5060219 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5060220 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5060221 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5060222 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5060223 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5060224 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5060225 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5060226 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5060227 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5060228 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5060229 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5060230 it looks like the rubber is burning and it is hard to put out
5060231 my cats were in there my cats were in there
5060232 if i had only known i would have driven at a blinding speed to him

5060236 to give more control to area parents who can make choices for their developing children
5060237 i am amazed at how my views have changed since i started reading lrc i find myself consistently agreeing with pat buchanan i cant believe it i want to thank you again for that i also want to thank you for pointing me towards journalists like justin raimondo wow
5060238 i often hear that ignorance is bliss indeed knowledge can be frustrating especially if one still watches cable news but ill take it over ignorance any day thank you for making me frustrated about the right things
5060239 solemnly warn them and tell them of the procedure of the king who will reign over them
5060240 this will be the procedure of the king who will reign over you he will take your sons and place them for himself in his chariots and among his horsemen and they will run before his chariots
5060241 he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and of fifties and some to do his plowing and to reap his harvest and to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots
5060242 he will also take your daughters for perfumers and cooks and bakers
5060243 he will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive groves and give them to his servants
5060244 he will take a tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants
5060245 he will also take your male servants and your female servants and your best young men and your donkeys and use them for his work
5060246 he will take a tenth of your flocks and you yourselves will become his servants
5060247 then you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves but the lord will not answer you in that day
5060248 no but there shall be a king over us 20 that we also may be like all the nations that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles

5060254 if it were up to me i would buy one a week until the prices started significantly turning around
5060255 quite a few of these are sales to investors who are renting out the homes to foreclosure victims
5060256 they can buy a home for under 90 000 have a payment of about 550 650 with taxes and insurance and rent it almost immediately for 900 to 1 100 per month
5060257 the goal will be to have the local government buy the property and keep the family in there
5060258 i think its going to make it more difficult for investors if local governments are going in and offering 60 cents on the dollar
5060259 people are really banking on future appreciation as the market corrects
5060260 prices have collapsed 40 to 50 percent sometimes 60 percent
5060261 every single closing ive had the banks have lost between 60 000 to 80 000
5060262 were seeing multiple offers on many of them and theyre bidding up over the asking price that will help to increase prices and stabilize the market
5060263 the rules have tightened down so much that theyve made us investors into what seems to be a high risk borrower
5060264 the reality is were not there are other ways to do it but its really hard to get conventional financing right now
5060265 the importance of it in my view is less today than we thought it would be 60 days ago
5060266 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5060267 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5060268 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5060269 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5060270 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5060271 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5060272 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5060273 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5060274 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5060275 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5060276 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5060277 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5060278 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5060279 the goal was to start sectarian violence with the car bombs
5060280 whenever you feel comfortable that youve eliminated them in one area they tend to re emerge
5060281 well never say that weve completed pursuing them because they may always come back
5060282 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5060283 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in tal afar and allow terrorists to come in
5060284 that only leaves three companies to secure the city creating gaps and the terrorists were able to smuggle in car bombs into tal afar
5060285 the iraqi government has made so many mistakes during the last operation i want to resign
5060286 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5060287 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5060288 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5060289 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength
5060290 security forces want to focus on the true fight right now but they are forced into a two front war to stop reprisals in the population

5060313 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5060314 it was approximately two miles just more than 3km from the runway
5060315 we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft
5060316 i have traditionally played golf on fear of failure i believe i need to move to a level where i can use confidence as a way to play better
5060317 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me earlier in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill
5060318 ive got a deep down confidence that i can battle through anything
5060319 i need to have more flamboyant confidence at the start
5060320 obviously ive been the number one european player for six years it is interesting that it has taken these major wins to get that across
5060321 what a day if my chiropractor had been here he might have told me to pull out so im glad he wasnt
5060322 after all ive been through i was going to finish no matter what
5060323 its been a long wait for me setanta readers comment of the day
5060324 you cant take anything lightly everyones fighting for places and everyones fighting to get ready to go
5060325 by the very nature of that it will be a proper game
5060326 what i know about scotland is that when they played against sussex they were always massively up for the game so you have to be up for the game as well
5060327 that was the focus of what were doing there were some things we did well theres a lot of things we can do a lot better

5060330 the process of democratization is likely to be messy and unsatisfactory but it is absolutely necessary democracy it is said cannot be imposed particularly by a foreign power this is true but beside the point it is more likely that the story today is rarely one of peoples resisting the basics of democracy the right to choose those who will govern them and other basic freedoms it is instead about people choosing democratic leaders and then becoming impatient with them and holding them accountable on their duty to deliver a better life it is strongly in our national interest to help sustain these leaders support their countries democratic institutions and ensure that their new governments are capable of providing for their own security especially when their nations have experienced crippling conflicts

5060335 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well
5060336 weve sentenced people to having those overcrowded buses passing them up
5060337 the answer for more money for transit is not to not vote for transit for two more years
5060338 are expansions of service frequency on our 24 existing bus routes
5060339 is a problem today but our economy will recover it always does and will come roaring back and that will help metro bus service
5060340 unless you build additional highway lanes with buses youve got a more expensive system sitting in congested traffic so its really not a better buy comparatively
5060341 you need a rail system to provide another way for people to get around especially in urban centers
5060342 people that think that the fed is some kind of political creature are mistaken they do a disservice to assume that and its very unfortunate that some people assume that
5060343 there wont be any reason to change anything at this meeting
5060344 i doubt a second stimulus package is going to happen but its rarely prudent to overestimate the wisdom or fiscal prudence of politicians during an election year
5060345 if its going to happen it must happen in september
5060346 last year was more of a traditional top down campaign
5060347 this time were a lean mean grassroots operation looking for more door to door voter contact so they know why its a great plan
5060348 were going for a wide range of sources and different donors
5060349 there are plenty of progressive young transit friendly voters in king county pierce county and snohomish county we are going to explore a lot of options and be creative in the way we reach them
5060350 weve got a presidential election with a heavy turnout expected and with high gas prices demand for transit is at an all time high all across the country
5060351 the sierra club opposed proposition 1 because the additional highway lanes would swamp all benefits of increased transit and worsen global warming
5060352 sound transit phase 2 st2 is a critical piece of our transportation future we are tired of sitting in our cars burning fuel and dollars while watching our time evaporate
5060353 still costs too much does too little and takes too long to implement
5060354 its an absolute lie to say it will fix things right away
5060355 plus you cant double down taxes on a failed strategy not in todays economy there isnt an economist in the world who would tell you this is the time for an expensive ballot proposition
5060356 include spending for roads bridges schools and other public facilities
5060357 the future path of metro rail systems in america is unquestionably upward triggered by congestion spiraling gas prices and citizen demand
5060358 the public has recognized the need for investment and immediate relief
5060359 thats what this measure provides the question is this stalemate or action should we sit back and do nothing hardly any other major city in the nation relies on just buses but light rail can put us back on the map
5060360 absence of voter approval of any plan to expand the system
5060361 should voter approval for a future phase capital program not be forthcoming
5060362 when the voter approved capital projects in st2 and sound move are completed the board will initiate two steps to roll back the rate of sales tax collected by sound transit
5060363 sound transit will implement a sales tax rollback to a level necessary to pay the accelerated schedule for debt service on outstanding bonds system operations and maintenance fare integration capital replacement and ongoing system wide costs and reserves
5060364 we are going to need all the taxes we are collecting
5060365 sound transit will never roll back taxes the agency is going to keep trying to win elections if it succeeds st will use all the tax money collected to build and operate more and more light rail no matter how long it takes no matter how much it costs no matter what performance is achieved
5060366 it seems to me that we should evaluate transportation alternatives objectively looking at both direct costs and externalities and one step further find a way to require that people who engage in an activity like driving pay for their externalities

5060372 we have deployed a search squad and security has been tightened in the vicinity and in kathmandu
5060373 there is no such notion anymore in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5060374 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5060375 russia overreached used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price
5060376 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5060377 serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union
5060378 the russian troops are starting to pull out and russian peacekeepers are coming in
5060379 we are here to protect the people and stop looting
5060380 all the roads are free for humanitarian aid and georgians
5060381 the us should immediately release dr aafia siddiqui god knows how many of our daughters like aafia siddiqui are languishing in us jails

5060390 the issue of who will be involved in post election negotiations will be determined after the election
5060391 there will be no immunity for any official who abuses his position to make illicit gains
5060392 the government of dubai has affirmed it stands resolutely against all forms of corruption bribery and illegal gains in public and private sector institutions
5060393 the government of dubai follows a policy of transparency towards these cases and there are strict directives that there should be no leniency for all forms of corruption
5060394 the government will continue upon directives from superior authorities to adopt a firm stance against all forms of corruption and will take legal measures against violators fighting corruption is among the governments top priorities
5060395 what these millions of rands in expenditures clearly show is that the municipality has way too much money on its hands and that taxpayers in ekurhuleni are paying too much
5060396 legally the metro is supposed to protect its employees i am concerned that the municipality could be opening itself to a counter suit from these former colleagues of mcbrides who could conceivably claim it is leaving them in the lurch
5060397 quite a few hundred thousand rand more if not a million rand
5060398 why is the metro footing the bill for that with ratepayers money surely the ekurhuleni municipality has no interest in fighting this case as it has nothing to do with them why not let mcbride fight his own legal battles
5060399 what has been happening since these expenditures were first uncovered at the moment theres just no way to tell
5060400 this years drill will be conducted under the south korean military led joint defence system supported by us troops in preparation for the transfer of wartime operational control
5060401 you know the day is not going to be as pleasant and flawless and effortless as these spreadsheets lead you to believe
5060402 mengapa kita begitu betah hidup di dunia yang penuh dengan cobaan dan ujian padahal nafas dan perubahan fisik manusia dari masa ke masa pada hakekatnya adalah langkah langkah ajal menuju liang kubur
5060403 karena kita terlalu berminat membangun istana di dunia dan lupa membangun istana di akhirat
5060404 bercerminlah pada al quran renungkanlah perintah perintah di dalamnya yang telah baginda lakukan dan larangan larangan yang telah baginda hindari di sanalah nasib baginda akan terjawab
5060405 neither a flight risk nor a danger to any person or the community
5060406 what nice fails to mention is that the medicines in question are in common use elsewhere in europe where prices are typically higher than they are here in the uk
5060407 nice has an important job to do but they need to adapt their approach for cancer medicines rather than lay the blame on the process and economics of pharmaceutical innovation
5060408 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
5060409 the share price is very important to a pharmaceutical company pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
5060410 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5060411 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5060412 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5060413 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5060414 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5060415 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5060416 ongoing negotiations with the u s looked for a mandate for its troops in iraq in light of potential threats they might face and their relations to the rights of iraqi individuals
5060417 is not bound by a timeline to sign the agreement until the coming of next u s president
5060418 the main points were agreed upon yet the agreement details are so complicated that they required return to the authorities of iraq and the u s
5060419 keen to make iraqi people and political decision makers get acquainted with the agreement details
5060420 present the agreement to the political council for security composed of major parliamentary blocs
5060421 the presence or withdrawal of troops is linked to the security condition in iraq
5060422 filling the vacuum of withdrawn troops is to be decided by the iraqi government especially after its security forces have taken over the vacuum and violence is at its lowest levels
5060423 six members of the u s security company blackwater were flown to washington to stand for trial on charges of killing 17 iraqi civilians at al nisoor square last september
5060424 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5060425 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5060426 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5060427 because hes the hero gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now so well hunt him because he can take it because hes not the hero hes a silent guardian watchful protector the dark knight
5060428 things will start to get worse before it gets better
5060429 as we looked through the comics there was this fascinating idea that batmans presence in gotham actually attracts criminals to gotham attracts lunacy
5060430 when youre dealing with questionable notions like people taking the law into their own hands you have to really ask where does that lead thats what makes the character so dark because he expresses a vengeful desire
5060431 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
5060432 this seems to be a movie that extols some of the conservative viewpoints that we are dealing with terrorists that you can trust people to make the right decision that sometimes you have to do things that you dont want to do and you have to cross lines that you dont want to cross if youre going to save if youre going to save your city in this case its gotham
5060433 but batman goes into another country and with a c130 snatches a guy out then throws him back here into gotham so theres rendition at one point the morgan freeman character says to batman wait a minute hang on youre eavesdropping on everyone in gotham and batman says yes to stop this terrorist morgan freeman says i cant be a part of it and yet morgan freeman does become a part of it and they find the joker one of the ways they find the joker is through eavesdropping i mean the parallels here of whats going on is to me stunning
5060434 well uh i think tha that insert answer that polls the best w his base here but we
5060435 well uh i think tha that insert answer that polls the best w his base here but we

5060448 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months

5060450 to make a woman march with the flag of the islamic republic in beijing is pure heresy and shows total disobedience of the laws mandated by our spiritual guides

5060587 the models are not accurate all the time for each property there are individual characteristics that need to be looked at to make sure the valuation makes sense
5060588 it will lock in some of the anomalies created from mass appraisals in 2004 and 2005

5060595 fire eagle is a huge step in making that happen
5060596 where i drive when i get there and whether i stop on the way is not the business of my insurance company or any other corporation who wants to place eyes in my car

5060608 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
5060609 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
5060610 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
5060611 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
5060612 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
5060613 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
5060614 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips

5060616 i was city editor just 32 years old the news of elvis dying hit like a ton of bricks there were no real story meetings in those days but i remember going into the managing editors office ed monteith a great nuts and bolt newsman in his day and urged ed that elvis should be the story of the day he disagreed i went to the back shop and discussed the story with kathy brooks the entertainment editor and enlisted her help to convince ed that it should be the line story ed trusted her judgment and said some mention would be on the front page i grabbed an album cover from home and asked the great andy donato to colour it andy in his genius four flexed it and bingo we had something that resembled a color picture of elvis on the front all of the sun front pages back then were in black and white as the day wore on and radio cfrb and other stations starting playing tributes to elvis it was then that ed finally agreed to the death of elvis being the line and with some urging from donato brooks myself and others ed wrote the king dies of course it sold a ton of newspapers it was the early days of the toronto sun and playing that story on the front in such a dramatic fashion blew away the globe and star and became a forerunner to many front pages in the years to come best sales were a big headline and one huge picture for me it was a personal triumph when word from our circulation department confirmed a sell out it was a great confidence booster and today as i sit retired after 43 years in newspapers 29 with the sun chain the only front page that hangs framed in my london home is that one the king dies cheers
5060617 i have traditionally played golf on fear of failure i believe i need to move to a level where i can use confidence as a way to play better
5060618 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me earlier in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill
5060619 ive got a deep down confidence that i can battle through anything
5060620 i need to have more flamboyant confidence at the start
5060621 obviously ive been the number one european player for six years it is interesting that it has taken these major wins to get that across
5060622 what a day if my chiropractor had been here he might have told me to pull out so im glad he wasnt
5060623 after all ive been through i was going to finish no matter what
5060624 its been a long wait for me setanta readers comment of the day
5060625 this is an exciting time and we want all our fans to be a part of history when the red wolves take their home field for the first time
5060626 there are still great tickets and ticket packages available at great prices
5060627 anyone in touch with reality cannot ignore the fact that something is very wrong
5060628 after the ordeal with my mother i was an only child i understand what patients are feeling
5060629 weve grown dramatically in the past five years the need is great
5060630 we have started an educational program we call journey through treatment
5060631 we tend to see people very early in treatment and they may be overwhelmed and scared
5060632 it is best to have a plan we suggest a template of a plan for a year information gathering their diagnosis insurance substitute income and family dynamics
5060633 i sent in a spout off but you didnt print it why
5060634 ich konnte mir diese form von aufm pfigkeit nur leisten weil ich leistung brachte
5060635 in business particularly in alaska you can see where we came from it changes all the time business has always been most exciting to me
5060636 every night at dinner we always discussed what the medical profession owed the general population
5060637 wed talk about people in dire straits and needed some extra help
5060638 all the people who lived there took care of all the kids
5060639 if a kid did something wrong they were told on grandma swan had cookies so we all visited her
5060640 they scooped us up took us out of there and gave us a home
5060641 i was always invited to dinner they were hoping id say something nice about them and their husbands which i always did
5060642 the station manager at the time mark sorley called up mad what are you doing i said this is a big deal
5060643 the next day the newspaper had a story that kmel broadcast the sputnik last night and boy he changed his tune and i got a raise

5060646 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5060647 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5060648 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5060649 it was more based not necessarily on the hair being pulled out but on the accusations she was making about being locked up in

5060655 i think were going to see a big change in the industry in the next few years
5060656 theyre looking at the consumer side of it not the business side of it
5060657 its not the general public getting towed its just the people that dont follow parking rules

5060672 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto il mio amico e ne ho fatto per me unica al mondo

5060800 you can drive if you want to i like to drive but its fine if you want to drive really its fine here do you want me to pull over at the next exit
5060801 i dont care if i drive i just want you to ask for help if youre getting too tired
5060802 i dont want to hear you use that word again
5060803 mom its just a word it doesnt mean what it used to mean that was in your day
5060804 the greatness of this country was rooted in the fact that a single farmer could produce an abundance of food the likes of which the world had never seen or imagined and so free the energies of countless others to do other things so much of recorded history is about the struggles of individuals and families to feed themselves that changed dramatically in this country
5060805 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5060806 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5060807 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5060808 these couples are mainly from poor communities and could not afford the big costs of a normal wedding

5060812 which of our indian cities have apartments with such security systems tell me
5060813 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5060814 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5060815 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5060816 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5060817 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5060818 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else

5060828 do you want the good news first or the bad news the good news is that last friday was my birthday and i hit the town and had a great time the bad news is that there is a points failure somewhere between stratford and east ham which means we probably wont reach our destination
5060829 ladies and gentlemen we apologize for the delay but there is a security alert at victoria station and we are therefore stuck here for the foreseeable future so lets take our minds off it and pass some time together all together now ten green bottles hanging on a wall

5060844 what nice fails to mention is that the medicines in question are in common use elsewhere in europe where prices are typically higher than they are here in the uk
5060845 nice has an important job to do but they need to adapt their approach for cancer medicines rather than lay the blame on the process and economics of pharmaceutical innovation
5060846 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
5060847 the share price is very important to a pharmaceutical company pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
5060848 too ashamed to speak about the occupation of any country he is already occupying one
5060849 u s forces have been in iraq for five years and they still fight in an unacceptable manner that violates human rights conventions bush had better talk about his own occupation of iraq
5060850 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5060851 the u s administration is stumbling in the middle east without considering any horizons for the future
5060852 it is totally obsessed with the idea of its war against terrorism and this makes it lose even in the simplest political sense
5060853 the u s administration has done more harm to its allies in georgia and the middle east than to its enemies
5060854 bush did not realize that by intervening heavily in other countries affairs he would give the same right to other players
5060855 the u s had no problem to interfere and separate provinces from bigger states like it did with kosovo
5060856 this is exactly what russia is doing now intervening to prevent the annexation of certain provinces to georgia russia is using the same logic that the u s used
5060857 in iraq we were dealing with a fascist government which was hated by all iraqis because of the suffering that was inflicted on them
5060858 saddam husseins regime threatened regional stability and made war with neighboring countries
5060859 why should bush care what russia does to georgia unless he or his administration has an interest in the issue to start with
5060860 the news is saying that the americans trained the georgians and apparently wanted them to join nato i cant blame the russians for doing what theyre doing theres a threat in their immediate vicinity and they decided to take care of it
5060861 what would the united states do if suddenly mexico became an iranian or russian ally theyd crush every last mexican one way or another
5060862 anything relating to agriculture is going pretty well but if you are in construction retail or financial services probably job security is something you should be worried about

5060868 the coaches were told in clear terms that they will lose their jobs if they attend the event
5060869 we dont know the exact reasons but it could be due to state politics
5060870 yes there were no coaches but thank god i have managed to win a gold

5060874 i carried ten wounded people to the hospital in my car
5060875 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge

5060877 obviously more of this water will be traversable in more parts of the year so we want to find it before hollywood

5060884 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5060885 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5060886 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5060887 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5060888 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5060893 we are his workmanship created in christ jesus for good works which god prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them
5060894 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creature the old things passed away behold new things have come

5060897 the fire is estimated to be 80 percent contained and isolated to the abandoned housing area
5060898 their support has helped limit the damage and bring this fire under control
5060899 there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in
5060900 we are encouraged that the improvement in the major injury rate achieved in 2006 7 has been maintained this years figures are the second lowest since 1997 98 reflecting an improvement of over 50 2007 8 also saw a new low in the rate of over three day injuries
5060901 nevertheless there is absolutely no complacency within the industry particularly in relation to asset integrity where we continue to invest more than 1 billion per year to maintain the safety of our installations
5060902 although there was no decrease in the number of major and significant hydrocarbon releases in 2007 8 we know that the majority of installations now operate from year to year without an incident of this kind
5060903 in striving to further reduce its hydrocarbon releases the industry will be seeking close engagement with technical staff at hse to further analyse the releases that have occurred and identify where action should be targeted

5060925 not only to prove biblical christianity but to make sense of any fact in the world van til holds that one must presuppose the reality of the self contained triune god and the self attesting revelation of the scriptures
5060926 the presuppositionalist endeavors to convince the unregenerate first by demonstrating that on unregenerate presuppositions of chance occurrence in an impersonal universe one cannot account for any sort of order and rationality
5060927 van til vigorously criticized the traditional apologetic approach of both catholics and protestants as failing to challenge the non christian view of knowledge as allowing sinners to be judges of ultimate reality and of arguing merely for the probability of christianity
5060928 a growing number of liberal christians and scholars do not believe that jesus rose bodily from the dead but what could be the ultimate cause of such a slide into unbelief in an area that is so vital and central to the gospel as the resurrection of christ
5060929 you tell me what the standards of truth and certainty are and ill meet those standards and then youll see christianity is true
5060930 even though youve proven the resurrection to me i dont need christianity because my standards are sufficient as far as they go
5060931 there can be no certainty regarding anything without first assuming the truthfulness of christianity

5060944 the first five months of this year have been our best yet we have noticed a significant crossover of customers from fractional and jet card programs and the increase of new customers entering the charter scene has never been stronger
5060945 the slowing economy has required that companies reflect on expenses and many are looking to jet charter companies to offset the high cost of travel they find they can get the same exact aircraft without any compromise on safety luxury age or service at prices sometimes 40 percent lower than fractional and jet card programs
5060946 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5060947 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation

5060978 their economies are soaring boosted by oil revenues in that region people are truly fascinated by planes
5060979 we never do anything to alter the actual structure of the plane for example enlarging the windows is impossible

5061014 when i was thinking about it i was getting ahead of myself
5061015 weve been waiting on this so many great athletes have come so close
5061016 it was a flagrant and a blatant false start that was not recalled and had tremendous impact on the race

5061021 we will also do well in the 4 100m relay i believe we can beat the americans
5061022 looking at whether torri edwards false started and whether the race should have been called back
5061023 definitely jamaica has it out for the u s they have very strong competitors we dominated for all the years prior to this everybody deserves their one chance in history to do well
5061024 i have confidence in my competitors and i really look forward to competing against them and getting to the finish line before them clean and drug free

5061042 every day every second we will be thinking of him
5061043 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5061044 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5061045 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5061046 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5061047 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5061048 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5061049 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5061050 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5061051 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5061052 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5061053 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5061054 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5061055 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5061056 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5061057 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5061058 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5061059 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5061060 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5061061 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5061062 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5061063 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5061064 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5061065 if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given toyota what theyve given them with regard to parameters on their engine based on flawed data that a team or the manufacturer one of the other had kited or shaved that certainly is detrimental to my interests
5061066 we had a decrease in the number of trees compared to last year and a decrease in fruit per tree steger said today

5061069 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5061070 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5061071 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5061072 i believe i need to move to a level where i can use confidence as a way to play better
5061073 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure
5061074 the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me earlier in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill
5061075 ive got a deep down confidence that i can battle through anything
5061076 i need to have more flamboyant confidence at the start
5061077 obviously ive been the no 1 european player for six years it is interesting that it has taken these major wins to get that across
5061078 theres no doubt ill always make myself available to help anybody else but in that sense winning a couple of majors may make people seek advice from me during that week
5061079 its such a high in my career it very easily could be the last high and many players have failed at this point in the past
5061080 you can get drawn into it winning can bring more pressure if you allow it
5061081 you just have to get yourself into doing your own thing
5061082 the community had been raising red flags for months and sometimes years
5061083 its a mystery to us how you can have the number of inspectors that were practically living in that building and have that level of disaster
5061084 it exposed an area that the city had never looked at this comprehensively when we looked at it we found a lot of areas that could be improved
5061085 this wasnt any building this was a public spectacle this was a high rise toxic vacant building that was under deconstruction
5061086 we cannot afford to have anyone else lose their life

5061122 i suppose everyone is entitled to their opinion but these people were clearly very misinformed about me to say that im not irish when i clearly am
5061123 we had our own issues in the north of ireland during those years but thankfully they didnt have anything to do with race in fact the race thing was never focused on i have a mixed heritage and am equally proud of both parts of it
5061124 racism and bigotry are not specific to ireland it is everywhere
5061125 these types of people find something to pick on everyone people often look at me and do not place me as irish at first sight but thats what i am i dont feel the need to prove that to anyone i dont wake up and tell myself that is what i am it is just a part of me in fact im not really sure you can define modern irishness as it is so varied now its in lots of things the love of my people of the music and of the country

5061150 we had a project recently in johnson county for 1 25 million
5061151 there were four bids and it came in under estimate thats what we want to see

5061153 and i dont recall seeing change orders that decrease the bid

5061195 this is something that weve all been looking forward to since the day that we first spoke with ryan and wife krissie about coming over here and joining the team
5061196 the addition of ryan coming on board now i think is going to make that list even grow larger
5061197 i think a lot of tony from a personnel standpoint as well as a driving standpoint and ive seen his success from an ownership standpoint with the usac cars and the world of outlaws cars ive seen him get the job done in other venues and i look forward to the opportunity
5061198 the thing that impressed me the most about ryan was that he asked all the right questions
5061199 weve still never spoke about a dollar in the contract the questions he asked me about how are we going to win races how are we going to win championships how are we going to get the right people in place to do the right jobs it was first and foremost about how he was going to run and how we were going to insure that we were going to get him quality cars equipment people to surround him to give him that opportunity
5061200 it shows we can expect a reasonable season but its only the start it is satisfying to beat a club like rennes who are playing in europe the club is growing and we are building
5061201 we had a few good opportunities but they failed we hit the bar and we were up against a really good keeper fabien audard who made some reflex saves
5061202 then shall the kingdom be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels and slept with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out
5061203 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons

5061206 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5061207 i have an imaginary friend i would like you to meet
5061208 you can make these up to one week in advance
5061209 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5061210 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5061211 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life

5061437 this letter is a disgusting attempt to justify the deliberate killings of innocent civilians there is no justification for these killings by the taliban
5061438 canada is in afghanistan at the request of the democratically elected government of that country
5061439 we will continue to protect the afghan people from these ruthless killers
5061440 the taliban demonstrates time and again its willingness to target civilians including afghan civilians as part of their efforts
5061441 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you
5061442 but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children
5061443 if we arrest their journalists or aid workers we will target them as we did in logar province they are not differentiating women and children with military targets and we will not differentiate theirs too
5061444 sto nel treno il treno v e i miei pensieri vanno con lui sento di dovermi esprimere a te che saprai andare oltre la bella forma di queste parole mirando al contenuto se penso a come il nostro incontro sia stato casuale e a come stanno le cose ora non credo che in un mese potessero cambiare cosi tanto di solito si dice che chi va piano va lontano se devo scegliere tra piccoli passi ed emozioni forti io preferisco qualche brivido in pi che mi f sentire pi viva piuttosto che un procedere a gradi xch non deve essere il tempo a fortificare i rapporti ma le nostre azioni dobbiamo essere noi a creare la nostra forma esempio come il vento col tempo consuma le rocce dandogli le forme piu strane invece uno scultore prende la roccia crea la forma che sente pi sua e la modella sulla base della sua ispirazione come mi insegni tu lispirazione crea azione e tu sei il mio attore ispiratore e anche importante aggiungere che un viaggio di mille miglia comincia con un singolo passo il nostro viaggio appena iniziato non s dove ci porter quello che conta non arrivare non voglio sentirmi arrivata da qualche parte ma voglio camminare insieme a te x il gusto di averti affianco e crescere insieme xche con te esistono le sfumature i colori i sapori limprevedibile come il mare e io in questo mare voglio nuotare farmi cullare voglio esplorare i tuoi abissi anche quelli piu oscuri tu fuori sembri molto piu superficiale di quello che sei forse hai solo paura a mostrare il tuo lato interiore mostrarsi x quello che si significa esporsi e quindi essere pi fragile per anche bello sentire paura sentirsi fragili a qualcuno e farsi volere bene e come in tutte le cose esiste sempre la cosa uguale e contraria xche chi ti vuole bene sa anche come farti molto male ma io sono certa che nn ce ne sar mai bisogno ti adoro

5061450 any notion that russia was the kind of responsible state that is ready to integrate into international institutions of the political diplomatic security economic kind this forward leaning modern russia that reputation is frankly in tatters

5061510 there has been discussions over the years about a possible sequel when those discussions came up about 7 years ago it was unsettling that it was suggested this time it would have to be done in cg im glad that did not happen but as far as coming up ideas for a sequel you have to admit there are a lot of other great holidays for jack skellington to take over

5062065 it amazes me how widespread this problem obviously is and how little at amp t and especially apple has done in acknowledging and addressing this issue

5062087 literature speaks the language of the imagination and the study of literature is supposed to train and improve the imagination but we use our imagination all the time it comes into all our conversation and practical life it even produces dreams when were asleep consequently we have only the choice between a badly trained imagination and a well trained one whether we ever read a poem or not

5062121 its hard to think of an issue these days that doesnt have a science or high tech angle to it
5062122 my real goal is to make the dialogue more based in knowledge and fact because i think that will cool down the rhetoric and help bring opposite sides of the political spectrum together to reach agreement
5062123 there used to be a science advisory committee that was in constant contact with the president and was expected to think through technology and make suggestions
5062124 i doubt that he knew for example that hydrogen is currently made from fossil fuels in a process that emits greenhouse gases or that liquid hydrogen contains only a quarter the energy of gasoline per gallon severely limiting an autos range

5062127 people are afraid of radioactivity because it is invisible and unknown
5062128 but that doesnt mean that we cant detect and work with it part of this wariness is that people dont trust the government when it says dont worry well they dont have to trust the government they can actually learn what levels of radioactivity are and what they cause and make their own judgment

5062131 many who describe the report even members of the panel when speaking as individuals put spin on their description that is not in the report
5062132 in the end the issues go beyond physics but we need to recognize that many measures we institute in the united states to deal with global warming can be classified as feel good measures or setting the example measures
5062133 we have to ask ourselves which example the developing world will follow our example of reducing carbon emissions or our example of generating enormous wealth

5062161 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5062162 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5062163 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship she once said samanthas the father i never had apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5062164 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5062165 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her
5062166 i think its a beautiful thing that 13 years later shes even more powerful as far as her name and her music just carrying on and that i think is a beautiful thing a lot of children come here to the museum that werent even born when selena was alive and they speak of her as if they know her and that comes from their parents in a weird kind of way its a little southing to my soul to know that she is not going to be forgotten as a person and also as an artist

5062192 the face of power early modern representations of elizabeth i
5062193 the manteo portrait however puts forth a much more aged countenance the face is leaner and wrinkles ripple from the queens mouth its definitely an unflattering realism in this portrait
5062194 it may have been commissioned by one of her wealthy subjects
5062195 it is a very little known portrait it was thrilling to discover it
5062196 oblong fair but wrinkled her eyes small yet black and pleasant her nose a little hooked her lips narrow and her teeth black
5062197 since we do not have full documentation on the provenance of the portrait there will need to be fuller examination of the portrait its paints its underneath surface and other data that can be gleaned from careful analysis

5062217 adolfs father alois hitler was the illegitimate son of maria anna schicklgruber it was generally supposed that the father of alois hitler schicklgruber was johann georg hiedler there are some people who seriously doubt that johann georg hiedler was the father of alois an austrian document was prepared that proved maria anna schicklgruber was living in vienna at the time she conceived at that time she was employed as a servant in the home of baron rothschild as soon as the family discovered her pregnancy she was sent back home where alois was born
5062218 caused such havoc as no file in the world ever caused before
5062219 the second bundle in the blue file contained the documents collected by dolfuss the small statured but big hearted austrian chancellor must have known by such a personal file he might be able to check hitler his task was not difficult as ruler of austria he could easily find out about the personal data and family of adolf hitler who had been born on austrian soil through the original birth certificates police registration cards protocols etc all contained in the original file the austrian chancellor succeeded in piecing together the disjointed parts of the puzzle creating a more or less logical entity a little servant girl hitlers grandmother came to vienna and became a domestic servant mostly working for rather rich families but she was unlucky having been seduced she was about to bear a child she went home to her village for her confinement where was the little maid serving in vienna this was not a very difficult problem very early vienna had instituted the system of compulsory police registration both servants and the employers were exposed to heavy fines if they neglected this duty chancellor dolfuss managed to discover the registration card the little innocent maid had been a servant at the rothschild mansion and hitlers unknown grandfather must be probably looked for in this magnificent house the dolfuss file stopped at this statement
5062220 it appears to me that hitler knew about his connection long before his chancellor ship like his father before him when the going got rough the hitlers went to vienna hitlers father left his home village at an early age to seek his fortune in vienna when hitler was orphaned after his mother died in december of 1907 he left for vienna not long after the funeral there he seemed to drop out of sight for ten months what happened during this ten month stay in vienna is a complete mystery on which history sheds no light it makes sense now that it has become established that hitler was a rothschild that he and his cousins were getting acquainted and his potential for future family endeavors was being sized up
5062221 by the 1840s he had developed a somewhat reckless enthusiasm for young girls
5062222 he had a lecherous passion for very young girls his adventures with whom had to be hushed up by the police
5062223 caused such havoc as no file in the world ever caused before
5062224 a little servant girl came to vienna and became a domestic servant at the rothschild mansion and hitlers unknown grandfather must be probably looked for in this magnificent house

5062243 while 85 of all intra sadc trade is duty free in 2008 we must acknowledge that the work is not yet complete
5062244 the remaining 15 of trade is still to be liberalised by 2012 and we need to ensure that all members are able jointly to meet that milestone
5062245 certainly the economic partnership deals will have a profound and even limiting impact on the process of deepening integration at the regional level

5062254 i cannot even imagine the consequences of such a disaster
5062255 by resorting to road blockades they have conveyed us that we are their slaves we are at the edge of the cliff in j amp k and i hope that the stakeholders will opt for a step backward

5062257 we have nothing against muslims of jammu and kashmir but kashmir centric political leaders are playing havoc with common people in the state we want to make it clear that there cannot be any appeasement of kashmir valley at the cost of jammu region the centre is adopting a biased approach against jammu
5062258 we are not against dialogue we are not against ordinary kashmiri people what we want is the piece of land at baltal and there should be no interference in the affairs of the shrine board this is related to the pride and honour of the whole of india
5062259 if there is any it should come from the government we are open to it
5062260 and i will dash them one against another even the fathers and the sons together saith the lord i will not pity nor spare nor have mercy but destroy them

5062262 pay no attention to those biblical glorifications of merciless slaughter and destruction behind the curtain the great and powerful
5062263 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it
5062264 found out the bible has soooooooooooo many holes and wasnt even translated correctly into english so what really are we reading
5062265 nihilism is not only the belief that everything deserves to perish but one actually puts one shoulder to the plough one destroys
5062266 nihilism is not only the belief that everything deserves to perish but one actually puts one shoulder to the plough one destroys
5062267 the influence that nietzsche has had on other philosophers and policy makers is quite profound

5062269 we are therefore unalterably opposed to entangling alliances via treaties or any other form of commitment which compromise our national sovereignty or commit us to intervention in foreign wars we are opposed to the negotiation or ratification of any treaty agreement or partnership that would deprive united states citizens of their rights protected by the united states constitution
5062270 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accomplish our overthrow our destruction should it come at all will be from another quarter from the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government from their carelessness and negligence i must confess that i do apprehend some danger i fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men and become the instruments of their own undoing
5062271 the real man smiles in trouble gathers strength from distress and grows brave by reflection

5062304 you cant go out and say you will win a medal you must make it happen
5062305 i tried to follow the pace follow the strategies i made i feel bad that it didnt go well there was a lot of boxing and a lot of pushing i gave it my all
5062306 not in my best dreams could i have imagined this it is very special just to compete here ive had an incredible experience with all my countrymen
5062307 i came here with a dream with a goal to get one medal for my country and for me
5062308 this is the best thing that has happened to me in my life i was eight years old and dreaming about this moment
5062309 the wicket seems to have a bit in it for both fast bowlers and spinners a bit of bounce and spin
5062310 who those five bowlers are we havent decided yet we are looking at two spinners harbhajan singh and pragyan ojha you rarely play four fast bowlers in this situation
5062311 you have to take chances against mendis in the sense that you make sure when he bowls a loose delivery you get the most out of it so you put pressure on the bowler as well
5062312 the inputs of sehwag and gambhir will be crucial to the rest who havent played too many deliveries of mendis but it is finally up to the individual
5062313 taking some kavu days in norway before the world cup ive had the opportunity to teach and play in the land of tall green mountains and deep blue waters
5062314 my first week i spent teaching and playing with a group of ladies american canadian and norwegian too it was awesome to watch skills develop alongside international friendships the progress these ladies made over the course of a week was awesome im still not sure which day saw more improvement the day of flatwater and surfing or the day dedicated to boofing either way these ladies walked away with a whole new outlook on boating
5062315 this week ive had a chance to paddle and train with local mariann saether showing me her backyard runs and playspots too theres certainly been plenty to do
5062316 i dont event know what to feel right now there is so much emotions going through my head so much excitement i guess i kind of just want to see my mom
5062317 its an honor to be on the relay on the team and part of what michael has done and its a great way to end our competition and it was the best relay i ever had thats all why we are pressured at to swim for michael its a pleasure to be on that relay but it by no means is the only thing thats going on
5062318 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
5062319 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5062320 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block
5062321 while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on the 29th of march 2008
5062322 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in uh republican party
5062323 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
5062324 lobbies regulatory agencies on alcohol issues that involve public health and safety
5062325 he doesnt listen carefully to people and make reasoned judgments
5062326 if john says im going with so and so you cant count on that the next morning
5062327 mccains personal fortune traces back to organized crime in arizona
5062328 im for clean energy i just dont ever vote for it
5062329 its a big bat to get back in the lineup
5062330 hideki has obviously been an integral part of this lineup for the past four or five years hell be a welcome addition
5062331 ive never seen anything like this before its a good thing for the community
5062332 me feel overjoyed none of me pot have any cover cause me a celebrate
5062333 ive never seen anything like this before its a good thing for the community
5062334 me feel overjoyed none of me pot have any cover cause me a celebrate
5062335 you feel like talking about it you look like a decent guy not somebody that would cause a lot of trouble
5062336 well i know we may not know each other but i just dont feel right leaving a person who seems to be really stressed out i i wish i could have done the same for my son
5062337 well i wont bore you with my life its just that seeing you there crying reminded me of what my son in prison might be doing him crying and me not being there to help him
5062338 yeah something stupid but he admits that and i dont hold nothing against him hes my son and my only son its just that i have no idea what he is going through and i just dont have the money to help him the way he needs
5062339 well not that he really needs it but it is frustrating that i dont have it to give to him i cant do a lot of things for him but a mother ought to still be able to look after her baby even if he is in prison and well just seeing you there youre about his age too and i worried that he might be doing the same thing in prison
5062340 it is possible that he could be but lots of times those guys find a way to make it through
5062341 how would you know you dont look like youve ever seen a prison
5062342 well maam looks like i have the surprise on you i actually have been in prison
5062343 i bet you would have been a help at the prison support convention they had in atlanta today
5062344 sure i visit a prison support site online and they have been talking about it for the last month or two i really wanted to go but i just cant afford it i know im only about 4 hours away from atlanta but it was just out of my finances i really wanted to go they said all kinds of people would be there and one of the best writers on prison issues was gonna be there speaking
5062345 you might not know him but he goes by the pen name faithone99 i think i read everything he wrote until they banned him for just mentioning his prison book i think that was very wrong to kick out someone who gave us far more help than anyone else there
5062346 yeah sometimes the hardest thing for an ex felon to do is get his life back when most people wont let him
5062347 i worry so much that my son will be the same way hes got 5 years left and i just dont know what to do its got me worried so much that sometimes i cant even get out of the house i was just coming back from a night service and decided to stop here for a moment to get some of those juices in the refreshment area its kinda like a routine i do because my son always loved those juices
5062348 how can you be so sure i would have given anything to make that trip to atlanta and just hear what faithone99 had to say i think i copied everything he ever wrote on the site and i even emailed him a few times
5062349 yes i told him how sad i felt when the site banned him and i told him i was also disappointed that i could not be able to support him and his writing i cant afford his book but i know there are people who could easily help him financially but wont but some of them will be the first to ask him to give them help while they sit back and do nothing for him its not right
5062350 well if you did meet him what would you ask him
5062351 i thought you were going to ask a harder question than that
5062352 isnt that what faith is to believe even when you have no physical proof to trust that god will do what you prayed him to do
5062353 and who walking this planet is perfect maam we can easily identify inmates as the fallen but in reality arent we all in that same position
5062354 maam faith is believing something will happen even if you cannot see it let me give you an example when i was in prison my mom promised to send me some money the moment she said it i had faith that she was going to do what she said it didnt matter what sins i had mom loved me enough to send some money and the moment she said she would send it i believed that she would i didnt have it at the moment and i had no proof of it but i just had faith that it was coming so it was already mine
5062355 but i just cant afford to send my son money every month every other month i might be able to send him 20 or so and i keep wishing i could send more but i have so many bills that have to be paid its so stressful wanting to help but not able to do it financially
5062356 maam youre missing the point this isnt about money this is about faith that your son will be ok faith for you means believing that whether you send him 20 or nothing god will look after him after all thats what you prayed for right
5062357 then start to believe that you cant pray on something then turn around and wonder if god will honor his word i had faith that mom was going to do what she said how much greater should that be of god even though i was in prison
5062358 you are so right lord you sound just like faithone99 he even talked about something just like that you ought to be there in atlanta
5062359 yeah i was by the way you mentioned faithone99 and that you emailed him
5062360 yes my name was kinda like his mine was faithinson and i used to always tell him that god was gonna bless him for sharing his posts on the prison site he really was a nice person and you could tell he had a lot of faith
5062361 never mind just part of a long day i wish to forget
5062362 this is that book faithone99 was talking about you bought this from him i cant take this that would not be right
5062363 maam i want you to have it i got 69 more in the car
5062364 i cant believe ive been talking to the one person that has helped me so much since my son has been in prison i owe so much of my sanity to you i prayed that the lord would bless you with the support you needed to keep writing i always include you in my prayers
5062365 thanks that means a lot but i want you to keep it
5062366 i was selling it to you i was giving it to you
5062367 no maam i wont take your last few dollars its on me honest
5062368 please give me a chance to give you something i cant afford to do a lot of things but somehow i believe that god gave me a wonderful opportunity to meet a person that could really help me and the least i can do is give you a couple of dollars it would mean so much to me
5062369 im not going to die of thirst if i dont get juices tonight and to be able to get your book in exchange of a couple of drinks is a very fair exchange please let me give you something
5062370 youre not taking my money im giving it to you
5062371 well if it makes you feel better i wish i had the same luck at the convention center today
5062372 is that why you were crying didnt sell enough books
5062373 worse than that i am afraid i spoke for 2 hours answered everybodys questions but not one person bought a book in fact people bought those other prison books by authors that werent even there i gave those people everything i had and got nothing in return i took 70 books and here i am with 70 well 69 now
5062374 i believed that if i could just have some faith then there would be some people out there that could help me do more for those with loved ones in prison millions of people have a loved one in prison and they all have questions heck the prison support site i was banned from claims to have over 50 000 members you know yourself that most of my posts were heavily read how can i contribute so much sow so much in helping people but not get any returns
5062375 its not much but trust me i have never been more thankful to give someone money as i am tonight you told me just a moment ago that faith is believing when there is no proof you helped me to see that tonight for my son and i want you to believe that for yourself
5062376 but youre not defeated not by a long shot if what you are doing is a help to people then you have to believe that god had a reaping for you a blessing god is not gonna watch you do kind works and not bless you for it we had a sermon just tonight about how god blesses those that help the poor not just poor financially but also the poor in spirit how many people read your posts and sent you emails you were the best writer on the site so i know you got hundreds of emails and comments
5062377 yeah quite a few but it it doesnt pay bills
5062378 but thats where you have to have faith right now everything looks like you have failed you write all these posts you get banned from prison support sites you write books that people are not buying yet people all want you to give them more of yourself while they sit back and do nothing there are a lot of people out there that need your help but many of them wont lift a finger to help you even if they had the means to but god sees all that even if you cant you simply have to believe that things will change even if you cant see any changes you said as much about me and my son so i am returning the favor
5062379 but you were supposed to speak two days right thats what i was told on the site
5062380 well you cant go home now people are counting on you they need to hear from you lots of people are relying on the hope you give them
5062381 i know but i really needed to sell some books i needed to see that what i am doing can be a blessing to me financially better than the minimum wage jobs i have now
5062382 i know lots of people say god bless you a lot but some of us really mean it when i pray to the lord to bless you for what you do for me i mean it and if so then i have to have faith that the good lord is going to bless you because i asked him to youve got some blessing coming but if you give up now you may never see them
5062383 please son dont give up on god he didnt give up on you and as you said to me he does not give up on inmates if i can believe my son will be ok then surely you can believe that hes got some wonderful blessing for you if you stay in faith
5062384 well i guess since my pen name is faithone i better show some of it to myself youve talked me into it im going back to atlanta and get a room and try this again tomorrow
5062385 god bless you gods gonna bless you i know there are lots of people that may not give you so much as the time of day but expect you to give them your watch but you have to believe that there are people that will support you just be patient ok
5062386 ok and the same goes for you your sons gonna be ok he will still have obstacles but if you keep him in your prayers he will be fine

5062498 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5062499 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5062500 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5062501 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5062502 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5062503 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5062504 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5062505 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5062506 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5062507 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5062508 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5062509 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5062510 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5062511 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5062512 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5062513 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5062514 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5062515 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5062516 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5062517 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5062518 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

5062523 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5062524 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5062525 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5062526 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5062527 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5062528 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5062529 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5062530 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5062531 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5062532 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5062533 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5062534 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

5062537 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5062538 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5062539 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5062540 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5062541 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5062542 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5062543 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5062544 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5062545 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5062546 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5062547 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5062548 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5062549 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5062550 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5062551 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5062552 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5062553 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5062554 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5062555 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5062556 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5062557 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5062558 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5062559 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5062560 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5062561 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5062562 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5062563 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5062564 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5062565 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5062566 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5062567 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5062568 an anime should be invalid if any of its characters are invalid
5062569 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5062570 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5062571 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5062572 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5062573 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5062574 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5062575 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5062576 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5062577 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5062578 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5062579 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5062580 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5062581 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5062582 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5062583 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5062584 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5062585 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5062586 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5062587 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5062588 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5062589 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5062590 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5062591 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5062592 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5062593 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5062594 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5062595 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5062596 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5062597 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5062598 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5062599 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5062600 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5062601 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5062602 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5062603 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5062604 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5062605 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5062606 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5062607 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5062608 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5062609 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5062610 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5062611 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5062612 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5062613 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5062614 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5062615 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5062616 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5062617 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5062618 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5062619 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5062620 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5062621 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5062622 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5062623 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5062624 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5062625 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5062626 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5062627 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5062628 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5062629 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5062630 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

5062661 it is not respecting the kaaba not respecting the house of god or the environment of the sanctuary
5062662 you are not supposed to even cut a tree in this city so how could you blow up a mountain the islamic laws have been broken

5062678 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
5062679 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
5062680 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5062681 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5062682 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5062683 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5062684 these special people that came today they all know randy and are doing this for us too being with us and helping us
5062685 i still remember standing right here at the intersection at 3 15 in the afternoon
5062686 you never really get over it as a mother it stays with you so every ride has been hard
5062687 im not quite sure what closure means to me hes always going to be there always been my friend so if theres such a thing as closure im not sure what it is
5062688 i think hed be pretty proud hes looking at us from heaven and watching over us too
5062689 our cancer rates are going up because the population is getting older but as more australians put on more weight it is going up even quicker
5062690 we need to recognise this now and act on it with tough measures to try to turn this around
5062691 we really dont know what works for obesity so we can borrow from tobacco because that was hugely successful
5062692 there is pretty much no limit to the type of food which is being advertised
5062693 with an increasing incidence of cancer now is the time for a range of tough decisions that will modify dietary behaviour and put public health before corporate interests
5062694 calling someone to ask how id be putting up my hurricane shutters
5062695 i just want to be there lying next to you
5062696 a personality from any of these two regions to partner dr mahama would enhance the partys chances of winning election 2008
5062697 we believe that these two regions stand marginalised out of election 2008 activities and running mate from any of the two would balance the political terrain to create the needed regional equilibrium
5062698 the pnc leader needs to search for somebody who shares his vision for the country which would yield the needed fundamental change not only our policies but how our politics work and how business should be conducted in ghana

5062701 i want to know gods thoughts the rest are details
5062702 the hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax
5062703 reality is merely an illusion albeit a very persistent one
5062704 a person starts to live when he can live outside himself
5062705 i am convinced that he god does not play dice
5062706 i never think of the future it comes soon enough
5062707 sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing
5062708 science without religion is lame religion without science is blind
5062709 anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new
5062710 great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds
5062711 everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler
5062712 common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen
5062713 science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn ones living at it
5062714 the secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources
5062715 the only thing that interferes with my learning is my education
5062716 god does not care about our mathematical difficulties he integrates empirically
5062717 the whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking
5062718 technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal
5062719 peace cannot be kept by force it can only be achieved by understanding
5062720 the most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible
5062721 we cant solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them
5062722 education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school
5062723 the important thing is not to stop questioning curiosity has its own reason for existing
5062724 do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics i can assure you mine are still greater
5062725 equations are more important to me because politics is for the present but an equation is something for eternity
5062726 if a is a success in life then a equals x plus y plus z work is x y is play and z is keeping your mouth shut
5062727 two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the universe
5062728 as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality
5062729 whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of truth and knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods
5062730 i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones
5062731 in order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must above all be a sheep
5062732 the fear of death is the most unjustified of all fears for theres no risk of accident for someone whos dead
5062733 too many of us look upon americans as dollar chasers this is a cruel libel even if it is reiterated thoughtlessly by the americans themselves
5062734 heroism on command senseless violence and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism how passionately i hate them
5062735 no this trick wont work how on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love
5062736 my religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind
5062737 yes we have to divide up our time like that between our politics and our equations but to me our equations are far more important for politics are only a matter of present concern a mathematical equation stands forever
5062738 the release of atom power has changed everything except our way of thinking the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind if only i had known i should have become a watchmaker
5062739 great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities the latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence
5062740 the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and all science he to whom this emotion is a stranger who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead his eyes are closed
5062741 a mans ethical behaviour should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties no religious basis is necessary man would in deeded be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death
5062742 the further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life and the fear of death and blind faith but through striving after rational knowledge
5062743 now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me that means nothing people like us who believe in physics know that the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion
5062744 you see wire telegraph is a kind of a very very long cat you pull his tail in new york and his head is meowing in los angeles do you understand this and radio operates exactly the same way you send signals here they receive them there the only difference is that there is no cat
5062745 one had to cram all this stuff into ones mind for the examinations whether one liked it or not this coercion had such a deterring effect on me that after i had passed the final examination i found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year
5062746 one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness from the fetters of ones own ever shifting desires a finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought
5062747 he who joyfully marches to music rank and file has already earned my contempt he has been given a large brain by mistake since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice this disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once heroism at command how violently i hate all this how despicable and ignoble war is i would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action it is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder
5062748 a human being is a part of a whole called by us universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
5062749 not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can be counted counts
5062750 next year i will fix this but this year nah i have too many other things on the go
5062751 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5062752 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead

5062757 many people americans especially make the mistake of equating morality with religious beliefs
5062758 ghanaians and foreigners who are contributing to ict development in diverse ways need to be commended and their experiences shared with the young through these media
5062759 despite these massive investments in ict infrastructure and ict capacity building ghana still to a large extent is digitally isolated from the global village because it lacks critical drive and strategies to harness the full potential for the socio economic development of the country

5062763 try to teach great truths instead of undertaking the much more difficult task of
5062764 to learn is an active verb the students fault is that many are too willing to expect that someone will teach them so they can forgo the necessity of learning the professors fault is that many are too willing to tell students what they know supposing that this constitutes teaching
5062765 the community had been raising red flags for months and sometimes years
5062766 its a mystery to us how you can have the number of inspectors that were practically living in that building and have that level of disaster
5062767 it exposed an area that the city had never looked at this comprehensively when we looked at it we found a lot of areas that could be improved
5062768 this wasnt any building this was a public spectacle this was a high rise toxic vacant building that was under deconstruction
5062769 we cannot afford to have anyone else lose their life
5062770 if that means its going to take a little bit longer to take the building down then its going to take a little bit longer

5062780 the values of a society are a crucial aspects of its peoples self conception of what they want to become in order to build communities that we all feel proud to belong to our values for education should be taken from our african philosophies cultural values which enshrine the principle of living for the community
5062781 we have to reshape our values to the idea that we have the responsibility for building happier communities and the central goal of education should reflect in building in the kid values for the future

5062786 poverty has fallen from 52 per cent in 1992 to 28 5 per cent between 2005 and 2006 but inequality has been widened between the northern and southern sectors of ghana in spite of the reduction in poverty level
5062787 unlike ghana botswana processes its diamond but ghanas economy still continues to remain traditional
5062788 in africa countries like botswana mauritius and south africa are doing far better than ghana although we have come a long way
5062789 its not an indictment on ghanaians the fact that we need a foreign firm to manage the company an advert was placed in the newspaper why didnt ghanaian management consultants form a consortium to apply for this
5062790 the issue is about expertise technical know how and we must create an environment for foreign direct investment where we can tap their expertise

5062813 pharmaceutical companies invest an average of more than 500 million over more than a decade to bring new medicines to patients
5062814 what nice fails to mention is that the medicines in question are in common use elsewhere in europe where prices are typically higher than they are here in the uk
5062815 nice has an important job to do but they need to adapt their approach for cancer medicines rather than lay the blame on the process and economics of pharmaceutical innovation
5062816 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
5062817 the share price is very important to a pharmaceutical company pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
5062818 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up

5062828 i wanted this book to inspire you not to look at my life and work in awe but to see how simple and approachable a creative life is its not about adding layers to your life but about stripping away obstacles fear is one of the biggest obstcales any of us can face fear of rejection inadequacy loss dont allow your fears and anxieties to overshadow your passions life itself is an artistic expression so you already have the capacity to create beauty you dont have to be an expert drawer or painter or even seamstress you just have to bring to fruition the ideas in your life that inspire you and that will help make life better for others

5062830 the production driving in runs is very good his batting average is up there above 300 he takes his walks hes been our mvp of this baseball team hes the guy that makes us go
5062831 people pitch around him and when they make mistakes he makes them pay and he uses the whole field people havent really given into him very much to let him put the ball in the seats and havent gone to attack him which is probably a smart thing to do

5062837 it dont matter to me i dont keep track of those things
5062838 i should ive seen him throw but pitchers are always trying to get better each time out so i am sure he will have something up his sleeve for us

5062856 russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody
5062857 im not quite sure why this deputy chief of staff felt compelled to make those kinds of threats
5062858 we have agreed along with our partners in poland and the czech republic to give the russians access both physical and technical access so they know whats going on every step of the way
5062859 weve agreed not to even make the interceptors operational until the iranians have test launched a missile that has the range to hit much of western europe not to mention russia so this russian warning is really an old song that theyre singing and it really just doesnt play

5062864 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5062877 we have had some pleasant surprises like the fencing sweep along with some disappointments but we are on track compared to our performance in athens it pales in comparison to the significant improvement our hosts have experiencing at these games

5062940 we are trying to close on a foreclosure property and the sellers realtor is jerking us around and cant get us any answers his web site says he is the leading expert in foreclosure properties in our area when we asked for the addendum to see which of the usual terms had been removed from the usual offer and which terms had been added he took a week to respond when we finally got the addendum it had all kinds of exceptions like no roof inspection so we made them change that the guy they sent to inspect the roof said he wasnt being paid to actually walk on the roof and hed only do the inspection from the ground then mr experienced foreclosure agent conveniently fails to submit a copy of our earnest money deposit along with the loan approval letter so with all these delays we were in danger of not closing on time and losing the earnest money
5062941 for nine days the sellers realtor wont answer our phone calls but in the meantime hes telling our agent to use a different title company probably the one where he gets a kickback
5062942 and then the title company assumes well pay back taxes owed by the defaulted owner which was the last straw blah blah and so on and so forth

5063065 el peronismo tiene que generar un proyecto alternativo serio pero no puede seguir perdiendo elecciones
5063066 hay que separar los tantos hay dos cuestiones una actual por las voladuras y otra a corto plazo para definir como seguir esa actividad
5063067 con relaci n al primer tema hay una responsabilidad actual que es de la provincia en termino de controlar el grado de explosiones y frecuencia y profundidad de lo que se hace y que deber ser analizado en el mbito que corresponde
5063068 en lo que me concierne tengo el borrador del proyecto de ley que va a ser presentado en el senado que lo venimos estudiando y les puedo adelantar que el martes pr ximo nos reunimos con la ministra de la producci n d bora giorgi y en pocos d as estaremos definiendo nuestra postura
5063069 ac no alcanza con parar las voladuras tenemos que saber que la geograf a ambiental significa un problema social econ mico y paisaj stico y que hay que conjugar las tres cosas porque hay una econom a local y regional que depende de las canteras hay muchos obreros que all trabajan por lo que hay que trabajar en forma arm nica y en contexto y as lo estamos encarando en el senado por lo que esperamos en poco tiempo tener la respuesta que se espera
5063070 est n las soluciones a mi criterio hay que cambiar algunas cosas del proyecto elevado por el ejecutivo por ejemplo no pensar que en un a o se puede hacer el programa de reconversi n y que ese programa lo presenten las canteras sino que debe estar el estado local siendo el responsable de a que y por que se quiere reconvertir cada cantera y despu s fijar el tiempo y si no hay un proyecto de reconversi n mal podemos fijar los tiempos y llegar a algunas cuestiones con el destino definitivo de los trabajadores
5063071 no voy a tener ning n tipo de ingerencia en la universidad fue un paso importante y la voy a seguir ayudando en lo que sea porque se la relevancia que tiene para nuestra econom a social educativa cient fica y tambi n econ mica
5063072 en octubre o noviembre se estar definiendo el futuro de la casa de altos estudios donde naturalmente s les puedo decir que mi inclinaci n esta clara para que quien gobierne la universidad sea una persona de tandil
5063073 son etapas estoy pensando en una construcci n pol tica con mayor protagonismo de mi parte pude haber recorrido hasta ahora un camino en el que tampoco me ha ido mal y estamos pensando despu s del conflicto con el campo que se generaron nuevos escenarios por eso quiero enfocar mi actividad parlamentaria en los programas de descentralizaci n autonom a municipal y una coparticipaci n diferente a la actual para lo cual estamos trabajando junto a los equipos t cnicos sin olvidarnos de la universidad que nos puede aportar definiciones en cuanto al desarrollo social y productivo
5063074 estoy poniendo el nfasis en el 2009 por m y por el momento que estamos viviendo en este pa proyectar a dos a os es bastante imag nese que proyectar a cuatro es mucho si fuera candidato a intendente en el 2011 es clave que primero tenga resuelta la problem tica de la legislatura
5063075 tiene que haber una reorganizaci n han sido treinta a os de puros fracasos y las fuerzas pol ticas no surgieron para ser siempre segundas o terceras en alg n momento el mundo justicialista quiere gobernar tandil es de esperar que los dirigentes tengamos la posibilidad real y concreta de ser una alternativa seria y para ser alternativa hay que gobernar no ser segundos
5063076 los tiempos en el peronismo se han acortado la problem tica con el agro el pj tuvo una retirada muy importante de la escena pol tica del interior hay que recobrar los caminos no en mi caso porque el conflicto lo segu de adentro y me compromet con lo que creo que ten a que hacer desde el comienzo estoy seguro de lo que hice y me permite seguir trabajando desde adentro
5063077 hay una recomposici n que se esta dando y en dos o tres meses van a darse las definiciones para saber como se va a encarar el 2009
5063078 es clave trabajar en un modelo productivo me interesa porque mi formaci n lo dice hay que establecer estrategias de desarrollo estrategias de organizaci n regional e institucional y despu s ver donde se inserta mejor
5063079 esta claro que en pol ticos como yo que no tenemos jerarqu a provincial para generar un movimiento propio en un primero momento tenemos que tener una alineaci n

5063114 as i said and one thing will be made very clear georgia will never give up any square mile kilometre of its territory
5063115 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system

5063121 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares we get pretty busy at the track sometimes
5063122 there is room have their children but not too soon
5063123 its very difficult to win this because you only have one chance every four years
5063124 if i make a mistake i make a mistake its not the end of the world
5063125 llev a mi sobrino en brazos hasta el hospital estaba vivo cuando llegu al hospital donde llegu con la ropa toda ensangrentada
5063126 he llevado a diez heridos hasta el hospital en mi coche
5063127 its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie
5063128 i didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy
5063129 you know what f dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5063130 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5063131 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5063132 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5063133 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5063134 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5063135 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5063136 this is a planning took where all things are going
5063137 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5063138 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5063139 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5063140 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5063141 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5063142 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5063143 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5063144 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5063145 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5063146 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5063147 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5063148 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5063149 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5063150 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5063151 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5063152 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5063153 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5063154 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5063155 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5063156 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5063157 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5063158 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5063159 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5063160 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5063161 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5063162 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5063163 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5063164 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5063165 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5063166 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5063167 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee
5063168 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5063169 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5063170 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5063171 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5063172 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5063173 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
5063174 its incredible the lord has blessed us with antibodies our whole lifetime
5063175 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5063176 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5063177 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5063178 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5063179 ora che c la class action proporr a tutti gli ebrei di chiedere un risarcimento danni ai savoia per 500 miliardi di euro una cifra a titolo simbolico per tutte le nefandezze che hanno compiuto
5063180 dovrebbero ricordare la storia e tutto quello che la famiglia savoia ha fatto ha contribuito a fare litalia con la i maiuscola
5063181 e in ogni caso conclude le responsabilit dei bisnonni cadono sui nipoti
5063182 sono sposato e sono contento ma sono cacciatore e di tanto in tanto mi piace anche sparare cos basta paga e chiuso non ci sono amanti non c niente
5063183 sono dei poveretti dice al telefono ad un conoscente il 28 luglio dopo la liberazione degli invidiosi degli stronzi pensa a quei coglioni che ci stanno ascoltando sono dei morti di fame non hanno un soldo devono rimanere tutta la giornata ad ascoltare mentre probabilmente la moglie gli fa le corna
5063184 come componenti della casa reale di savoia teniamo a significare che non aderiamo in alcun modo alla richiesta di danni avanzata contro litalia da nostro fratello e da suo figlio emanuele filiberto nostro padre il re umberto ii morto dopo un interminabile e sofferto esilio avendo sempre cara limmagine della patria lontana italia innanzitutto fu il punto di riferimento di ogni suo pensiero
5063185 il presenzialismo di vittorio e figlio una continua fonte di angustie e mortificazione per tutti noi

5063191 not by approximating to the world but rather by representing in the world the true life and privilege of the children of god the fundamental need was for the church to recover an understanding of what she truly is
5063192 an idol is anything we add to jesus in order to make life work the irony is that in the call to preach the gospel many fail to apply the gospel personally in ways that free their heart from a performance trap
5063193 you dont have anything to prove to us or the world
5063194 the work is finished at calvary and that work alone has unlimited meaning and value keep your focus there
5063195 unfortunately it the church growth movement fell victim to an idolatry as old as the tower of babel the belief that we are the architects of the work of god as a result we have the best churches men can build but are still waiting for the church that only god can get credit for
5063196 nice cannot adopt a money no object policy thats make believe land not reality but why are the drugs that cost pennies to manufacture priced at 30 000 the big pharmas blame the cost of research at best thats a half truth even though the miraculous quality of the research is acknowledged
5063197 marketing costs generally are about twice the spend on research and development
5063198 do i really love alcohol more than my dear lord
5063199 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5063200 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5063201 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5063202 the iranian media is mistaken it was the launch of a rocket capable of carrying a satellite the omid satellite was not launched itself
5063203 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5063204 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5063205 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5063206 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5063207 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5063208 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5063209 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5063210 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5063211 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5063212 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5063213 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5063214 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5063215 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5063216 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5063217 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5063218 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop

5063228 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5063229 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5063230 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5063231 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5063232 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5063233 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
5063234 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
5063235 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
5063236 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
5063237 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
5063238 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
5063239 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
5063240 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
5063241 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
5063242 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
5063243 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
5063244 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
5063245 a message has been sent out to all units citywide and countywide to be on the lookout for the trailer
5063246 because i dont think we are going to see this vehicle out there driving on the roads
5063247 its a museum piece valued upwards around a million dollars
5063248 its only one of one thats whats important about it
5063249 he drove that car all the way through the entire year 1963 to win the nationals
5063250 i dont think the thieves knew what they were getting
5063251 out of the ordinary for someone to grab a trailer when they dont know what is inside
5063252 kt rzy w szermierce s od niepami tnych czas w i tylko na niej eruj
5063253 its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie
5063254 i didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy
5063255 you know what f dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5063256 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5063257 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5063258 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5063259 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5063260 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5063261 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5063262 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5063263 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5063264 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5063265 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5063266 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5063267 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5063268 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5063269 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5063270 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5063271 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5063272 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5063273 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5063274 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5063275 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5063276 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5063277 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5063278 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5063279 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
5063280 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
5063281 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5063282 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5063283 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5063284 it cant be described well never ever see it again
5063285 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
5063286 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
5063287 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
5063288 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
5063289 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5063290 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5063291 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5063292 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5063293 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5063294 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5063295 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5063296 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5063297 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5063298 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5063299 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5063300 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5063301 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5063302 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5063303 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5063304 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5063305 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5063306 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5063307 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5063308 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5063309 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5063310 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5063311 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5063312 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5063313 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5063314 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5063315 will convene again just to deal with the situation of zimbabwe
5063316 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
5063317 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
5063318 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
5063319 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
5063320 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
5063321 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
5063322 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position
5063323 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to
5063324 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5063325 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5063326 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5063327 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5063328 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5063329 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5063330 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5063331 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5063332 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5063333 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5063334 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5063335 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5063336 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5063337 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5063338 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5063339 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
5063340 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
5063341 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
5063342 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
5063343 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
5063344 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
5063345 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also

5063357 of course over the ages our weapons have become more sophisticated with gotham we tried a new one economics but we underestimated certain of gothams citizens such as your parents gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself and gotham has limped along ever since we are back to finish the job and this time no misguided idealists will get in the way like your father you lack the courage to do all that is necessary if someone stands in the way of true justice you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart

5063369 the community had been raising red flags for months and sometimes years
5063370 its a mystery to us how you can have the number of inspectors that were practically living in that building and have that level of disaster
5063371 it exposed an area that the city had never looked at this comprehensively when we looked at it we found a lot of areas that could be improved

5063416 selling sucks how to stop selling and start getting prospects to buy
5063417 a good example is when i release a product for say 97 and small business owners and marketers will review it and tell me its so great im crazy to sell it for less than 500 most salespeople on the other hand will balk at spending even 97 and will demand the information for free
5063418 its important to start all sales relationships from a position of power and you do this in two ways 1 through your outward presentation
5063419 it goes to show how presenting yourself as a business equal doesnt intimidate but instead places the other pary at ease and builds instant trust and respect
5063420 there is no reason and the truth is plain to see
5063421 germany has become a nation of uniforms goose stepping to hitlers tune where boys of ten are taught to throw hand grenades where women are regarded as breeding machines most cruel joke of all however has been played by hitler amp co on those german capitalists and small businessmen who once backed national socialism as a means of saving germanys bourgeois economic structure from radicalism the nazi credo that the individual belongs to the state also applies to business some businesses have been confiscated outright on others what amounts to a capital tax has been levied profits have been strictly controlled some idea of the increasing governmental control and interference in business could be deduced from the fact that 80 of all building and 50 of all industrial orders in germany originated last year with the government hard pressed for foodstuffs as well as funds the nazi regime has taken over large estates and in many instances collectivized agriculture a procedure fundamentally similar to russian communism

5063427 and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favour with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus
5063428 how shall this be seeing i know not a man
5063429 and the angel answered and said unto her the holy spirit shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god
5063430 i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god
5063431 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god
5063432 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned
5063433 but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god
5063434 and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the holy spirit it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come
5063435 grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ
5063436 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
5063437 but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god
5063438 the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy spirit be with you all amen

5063442 and the angel answered and said unto her the holy spirit shall come upon thee and shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god

5063445 private ownership of guns should be banned because i hope you can see im phrasing this as an answer
5063446 when researchers studied the 30 000 accidental gun deaths of americans of all ages that occurred between 1979 1997 they found that preschoolers aged 0 4 were 17 times more likely to die from a gun accident in the 4 states with the most guns versus the 4 states with the least guns likewise school kids aged 5 14 were over 13 times more at risk of accidental firearm death in the states with high gun ownership rates the findings indicate that gun availability is associated with accidental death by shooting
5063447 the findings indicate that gun availability is associated with accidental death by shooting
5063448 in a 2001 study small groups of boys from 8 to 12 years old spent 15 minutes in a room where a handgun was hidden in a drawer more than two thirds discovered the gun more than half the groups handled it and in more than a third of the groups someone pulled the trigger despite the fact that more than 90 percent of the boys in the latter groups had received gun safety instruction
5063449 the ways in which people die by guns would not make a good television cop show
5063450 we have done four surveys on self defense gun use
5063451 and one thing we know for sure is that theres a lot more criminal gun use than self defense gun use and even when people say they pulled their gun in self defense it usually turns out that there was just an escalating argument at some point people feel afraid and draw guns

5063460 we reiterate our stand that if a concrete proposal or an agenda is sent to us for dialogue we will act accordingly
5063461 we have done everything that had to be done and now we expect the nsg exemption without any change to the draft that was circulated to them recently
5063462 we expect the process to move consistent with the july 18 2005 understanding and any change in their nsg position is problematic
5063463 we can not agree to further demands and there is no way we can
5063464 you never underestimate an opponent much like you never get overawed by his reputation
5063465 a number of great players have bitten the dust just because they took it for granted the russian world champion sergey vodopyanov made the same mistake and underestimated me see who reached the quarterfinals
5063466 its a cardinal sin in any other sport and im not going to step into the ring thinking he would serve it on a platter
5063467 the administrations mis governance was having its effect and we could not carry the koda baggage any more
5063468 we have asked the governor to take a final decision in the matter
5063469 we have burnt our hands once with the independents and there is no chance of our party siding with the jmm we prefer to go for polls rather than experimenting with new formations

5063473 the indo us nuclear deal is important for indias energy security and i think swiss government will most likely support the waiver for new delhi at the nsg meet
5063474 the nuclear deal is good for india and it should be allowed to go through
5063475 it is a decision that has to be taken by the government the parliament has no role to play in it but i am confident that the government will take a favourable stand on the issue
5063476 no untoward incidents took place the situation is tense but under control
5063477 rather obstructions were created by the vajyapee government to ensure that punjab did not get anything
5063478 very very unfair and uncharitable comment against the nation and the majority community
5063479 nowhere in the world minorities get such importance than in india
5063480 i will go to certain ubran areas to campaign for the party candidates
5063481 the entire skywalker solo family structure will be destroyed by maras death
5063482 i watch and read star wars to be entertained not shocked and depressed at how realistic it is
5063483 in fact if i had seen what happens to anakin in episode three before seeing rotj i probably wouldnt even be a star wars fan right now
5063484 i dont want to be heart broken i dont want my guts ripped out i like the good guys to win and i like the bad guys to lose simple as that
5063485 i did feel like a part of me was missing after i read sacrifice much the same way luke and ben felt
5063486 no it didnt happen theyll come back next book shut up go away meanie
5063487 good call kalira from july 6 2007 finally another star wars fan that that seems to still have thrir feet on terra firma
5063488 if sev couldnt contact delta that means his helmet asploded which means that his head asploded oh no
5063489 hello my name is ben skywalker you killed my mother prepare to die
5063490 at the end of sacrifice jason even explains the reason once ben learns the truth he will be furious enough to attack jason in a way as to make him a worthy apprentice further i believe jason is the good guy now anyway
5063491 for example if tim zahn had been writing sacrifice he wouldnt have killed off mara in such a blatantly stupid way as travissty did
5063492 force ghost can still be there even if the body is left behind anakin sky walker did it remember lets not forget the first force ghost qui gong jin
5063493 both of their bodies were burned to a crisp nothing left
5063494 i think jacen says that the trick to train somebody is to push them hard enough but not go overboard in which case the become disappointed and they give up
5063495 her death was in my completely ignorant of anything that may be happening later in lotf eyes pointless and nonsensical
5063496 oh no mara died how pointless and nonsensical what should i do make a petition no how about i just not buy lotf inferno and save everyone the trouble of being bitched at
5063497 kalira you dont write either so please just be quiet i get a headache when i read your little rants you have no right to yammer on like you do i doubt that anyone would mind if you didnt buy inferno because then we wouldnt have to put up with your crying
5063498 kalira go get a boyfriend and find something better to do with your time
5063499 i picture you as the fat chick in jabbas palace with a turkey leg in your hand and green teeth
5063500 now on to fanfiction grow up its the cheesiest thing ive ever seen you are obviously not a good writer if you need to write books on the net
5063501 also mara jade is the second best eu character ever
5063502 lucas himself introduced the idea of creating life through the force so kalira should write to him and see how far she gets
5063503 kalira your website is a mess i will no longer waste time with you you are a cheeseball superfan who needs to adjust your glasses so you can see that your life has been a waste
5063504 you dont care about star wars your just here to complain to ppl and tell them theyre stupid
5063505 if you dont care how big a star destroyer is then don
5063506 im here just to show you that maras death made about as much sense as you complaining about something you care nothing about
5063507 like ive said before about darth vader and force cure maras death was highly stupid just as your comments
5063508 go back to your blog and talk about me and tell me im an idoit for complaining but at least explain your thinking

5063515 if anybody is intrested here is a link for inferno spoilers
5063516 im praying they were referring to anakin solo not our ani the idea of spontaneously bringing anakin skywalker back to life at this point in time is something im trying to avoid pondering because im afraid my head will explode
5063517 id continue but i need to go have a life sorry raxus id offer you an invitation but youre kind of a lost cause
5063518 but to satisfy dear raxus one exclamation point is sufficient per sentence if you really must make a statement up to three are excusable ten plus capitalization is due to either mental incompetancy or a broken keyboard
5063519 luke will crush you and i refuse to let you destroy the future for my ben
5063520 but i love not was the heroine mara jade with all my heart
5063521 luke will crush you and i refuse to let you destroy the future for my ben
5063522 this is why i been telling people to please be civil to others on this board
5063523 raxus is right i have read watched and played much on star wars and they can heal themselfs from posin even non jedi can do it with certain medical packs that heal imediatly
5063524 she came with the idea to kill mara three years ago what is your opinion for this great idea most cleverly thing
5063525 thats the beauty about fiction one reacts to characters as if they are real people
5063526 i know that was a vision but think about it leia fighting jason and she has maras lightsaber if this vision is what i think it is then leia will die probably toward the end of this book series and i am a firm believer of things happening in threes first lumiya then mara i dont think leia will die as jacens vision says she does but it will probably be similar
5063527 wow they were on neither side they didnt kill people because they hated them they killed them for the good of the galaxy
5063528 you dont just kill off a character like mara jade skywalker
5063529 rejoice for those around you who transform into the force mourn them do not miss them do not attachment leads to jealousy the shadow of greed that is

5063561 ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the lords table and of the table of devils
5063562 ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin
5063563 and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever
5063564 forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil
5063565 for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil
5063566 submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you
5063567 thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble
5063568 and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee jesus thou son of god
5063569 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour
5063570 and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat
5063571 put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil
5063572 every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed
5063573 lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices
5063574 and the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it
5063575 in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them
5063576 wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others
5063577 which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory
5063578 and having spoiled principalities and powers he jesus made a shew of them openly triumphing over them in it
5063579 and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give for his life
5063580 so went satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown
5063581 and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day
5063582 to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins
5063583 i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan
5063584 in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil
5063585 no man can enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house
5063586 the word is sown but when they have heard satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts
5063587 get thee behind me satan for thou savourest not the things that be of god but the things that be of men
5063588 the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them
5063589 and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven
5063590 but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan
5063591 and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen
5063592 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places
5063593 and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him
5063594 then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
5063595 ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it
5063596 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
5063597 he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil
5063598 fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried
5063599 for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty
5063600 whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world
5063601 it is difficult to make out from the video footages about his bowling the more you play the more comfortable you will get
5063602 you have to take chances against him in the sense you got to make sure when he bowls a loose delivery you get the most out of it so that you can put pressure on the bowler of course inputs from sehwag and gambhir they would really help
5063603 in any form of cricket whether in test cricket or one dayers the start is very important but it does not mean the entire pressure is on the openers to always give you a good start sehwag is sort of a player who takes a bit of risk
5063604 of course it is crucial he is in a very good nick he and gautam gambhir have played well in the test series also of course they will have some added responsibility but no real pressure
5063605 que tenho eu meditado sobre deus e a alma e sobre a cria o do mundo n o sei para mim pensar nisso fechar os olhos

5063607 the film is a classic and needed realistic background to support the script when you compare the budget of this film with tamil or telgu film it is still much smaller
5063608 in our industry it is the first time that so much money have been invested on shooting locales and international artists this is also the first south indian film entirely was shot in uk
5063609 well it feels nice to work in different countries know the culture and musical tastes of the people across borders
5063610 i did not exploit ranbir deepika off screen chemistry its a team effort a captain needs help from every team member and not some of them
5063611 i am a tough taskmaster but fortunately i had actors who could understand and compliment me
5063612 its a story of a man named raj and the three different women who enter his life when he is 16 24 and 30
5063613 i needed someone who could play 16 and 30 at the same time so from the onset it was ranbir and i knew he is a good actor
5063614 generally importing countries do not look upon the indian exporters as a reliable long term supplier naturally indian exporters suffer from handicap which is reflected in the price realisation for indian sugar
5063615 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
5063616 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
5063617 there are estimated to be thousands of members in the bia family and having a source for obtaining large quantities of specific bia molecules is critical to gaining access to the diverse functional activities provided by these molecules
5063618 but even the intermediate molecules that we are producing can exhibit important and valuable activities and a related area of research will be to examine more closely the pharmacological activities of these metabolites and derivatives now that pure sources can be obtained
5063619 if one thinks of these molecules as encoding functions that are of interest to us the ability to produce nonnatural alkaloids will provide access to more diverse functions and activities by expanding to nonnatural alkaloids we can search for molecules that provide enhanced activities new activities and not be limited by the activities that have been selected for in nature
5063620 as a result our bodies and brains feel less difference between day and night
5063621 people are sleeping in front of the tv or nodding off during conversations and taking long afternoon naps this leads to less sleep at night in a way their sleep habits become more like babies and less like those of healthy adults who sleep in consolidated periods during the night
5063622 improves sleep and daytime vigilance helping to re organize the circadian system the bodys internal clock
5063623 its a good way to attract families so that they can learn about you know small steps they can take to reduce their carbon footprint

5063630 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5063631 we attempted to do so by the non waiver trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5063632 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5063633 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important

5063676 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5063677 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block

5063720 this study shows that extremely elderly people have retained memory of being infected with the 1918 flu even 90 years later
5063721 its important to know that you can develop immunity to such a pandemic virus that has implications for new pandemic viruses
5063722 the elderly might be a very good donor source for finding antibodies against viruses
5063723 this study shows that humans can develop very potent immune responses against dangerous influenza that cause pandemics
5063724 it gives us hope that we can develop vaccines and antibody treatments for any other pandemic viruses that come along
5063725 the implication of this study is the 1918 virus was so powerful that the immunity you had to have in order to survive was so prominent that it lasted for the rest of your life
5063726 so those in certain age groups who had seen a related virus had the strongest responses
5063727 either they died or they developed a profound immune response
5063728 up to now there has been just a very light off and on rainfall so much so that last night the people continued celebrating carnival

5063731 its happening all over town were aware of a number of suburban shops that have been converted to worker accommodation
5063732 the owners are obviously looking to get a return on them using them as cheap accommodation
5063733 theyre generally housing migrant workers and are often high density in terms of sleeping when we pull up at a premise which is supposed to be a shop and we discover there are a whole lot of people there it can be quite a problem
5063734 they could potentially be liable if there was a loss of property or even of a life if they havent done things by the book

5063739 hmsa is stepping up once again to partner with us in providing affordable and accessible health care services in east hawaii
5063740 this new partnership between hmsa and bay clinic will expand access to breast and cervical screening services reproductive health care services and maternal and infant health care services for the women of the puna district
5063741 in the long term bay clinic anticipates the program will have a community wide impact on teen pregnancy rates prenatal care utilization infant and maternal health and breast and cervical cancer screening and early detection
5063742 it used to be that you could sell short only on an uptick
5063743 you can sell short anytime you dont have to borrow the stock you just have to identify where youd get it
5063744 they clearly increased the volatility in the stock market they gave the hedge fund managers a new way to make money
5063745 how do you prove a negative i can only control the things i can control i cant control wall street
5063746 sterling was affected more than others because were a liquid stock
5063747 the interplay between investment bankers and community bankers helped create the violent swings in the depression
5063748 it became a matter of how much product could you provide
5063749 it got so bad all you had to do was sign a paper and you got a mortgage
5063750 i know a lot of people who are 29 years old i dont know any who have an income of 1 million a year
5063751 this kid couldnt pay for one house much less nine
5063752 all of a sudden these major money center banks new york city banks got caught with an inventory of mortgages that was surplus
5063753 are burdened with the remnants of a credit crisis that was not of our own making
5063754 the mistake we made is we expanded with our developers
5063755 a builder who has made a lot of money buys real estate to make more money
5063756 historically if you banked a developer you had all of his business
5063757 we wanted to have x amount of the construction activity in the boise market we ended up with x plus y
5063758 about 8 5 billion of our 9 billion portfolio is operating extremely well
5063759 its been a year now it takes some time to get your arms around the problem
5063760 the problem came on suddenly while nobody can clearly call the bottom were probably bouncing off the bottom now it will take a couple of years to fix
5063761 has done a marvelous job of identifying the problem and fixing it
5063762 without that we could have had much more serious problems
5063763 the collision occurred when an eastbound dodge mini van with two occupants failed to stop at a stop sign on holmes road

5063775 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5063776 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5063777 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there

5063784 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5063785 i guess i put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank after bob and i both grab a little break itll be time to start depositing
5063786 qu hago con esto le pongo cinta en los agujeritos y me grabo uno de la negra sosa arriba
5063787 you can imagine what horrible consequences there would be if we followed their political and economic model
5063788 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5063789 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5063790 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5063791 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5063792 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new
5063793 there was a brief five year period when we could get away with treating russia like jamaica thats over now we have to deal with them like grown ups who have more nuclear weapons than anybody except us

5063798 the real purposes were preparation under this noise of attacks to iran and emergency inclusion of ukraine in nato to accept in nato of the country with territorial claims according to the charter of this organization is impossible at georgia they were means the question on acceptance was a bluff from washington and to ukraine of claims while is not present under aegis of the russian aggression against georgia the usa can urgently accept ukraine into nato for this purpose it is necessary to expel the black sea fleet from sevastopol as a matter of fact and has occurred it now at coast of abkhazia back it will not start up as promises kiev the ukrainian militarians try to disconnect at present the electric power on the base of the black sea fleet ukrainians provided to georgians armies also human stuff ukraine at present is at war with russia no other script except for section of ukraine on two parts western and east together with crimea is present

5063825 cualquier noci n de que rusia es un estado responsable y preparado para integrarse en las instituciones internacionales de mbito pol tico diplom tico econ mico y de seguridad ha cambiado ahora tenemos una rusia diferente
5063826 es que rusia debe someterse a las consecuencias por sus acciones contra un estado soberano
5063827 la imagen de una rusia moderna y avanzada como la describi hace un mes el presidente dmitri medv dev est ahora echa unos gui apos eso ya supone una consecuencia directa para rusia
5063828 adem s los rusos no han hecho m s que estropear sus relaciones con otros vecinos como ucrania o polonia creo que mosc ha cometido un grave error
5063829 vamos a tomarnos nuestro tiempo para valorar qu consecuencias tendr n las acciones de rusia en nuestras relaciones con este pa s
5063830 esta vez espero que lo digan de verdad el presidente ruso debe demostrar que puede cumplir su palabra o de otra manera la gente se preguntar si se puede confiar en rusia
5063831 desde mi punto de vista los rusos probablemente se har n los rezagados y se tomar n m s tiempo del que nos gustar a creo que debemos seguir manteniendo la presi n y asegurarnos de que cumplen con el acuerdo firmado en el tiempo previsto
5063832 existe una preocupaci n real de que rusia est virando su rumbo m s mirando al pasado que al futuro y espero que en las pr ximas semanas veamos acciones que nos permitan descartar este temor

5063854 we want stability in the country we want political stability

5063856 weve tried to replace light bulbs we can probably encourage more recyclable materials with our vendors

5063861 its hard to go completely green but thats not to say that little things cant be done here or there
5063862 we found that to work better because the public doesnt necessarily know the different bins
5063863 the most important element is if theyre really taking it seriously or if theyre just paying lip service

5063877 because i remember thinking my parents might be seeing the movie
5063878 while i agree with helping our neighbors certainly donot agree that we need to give any of this money to the rez
5063879 how can you justify spending money paid in by north dakota taxpayers on a group of people that choose to live on sovereign land
5063880 susan amp chad i agree wtih you 100 great letter amp great posts
5063881 first off to all you that are prejudice and im sure most of the people that are against what a good brother that would be chad has to say
5063882 to so i ask have you been on the standing rock reservation
5063883 well chad have you seen the amount of money that we do spend on them they are in our prisons and they use our medical facilities
5063884 take the state surplus and put it to use on the reservations
5063885 shouldnt a large part of the surplus be given back to the people whove paid it
5063886 lets keep the surplus for the tax paying citizens of nd and not fund the reservations
5063887 i think putting some money into expanding the walking bike trails would be an excellent place to put some of this surplus to good use
5063888 we can send some state tax surplus to the reservations when they start sending tax dollars to the state
5063889 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
5063890 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
5063891 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
5063892 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
5063893 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted

5063900 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
5063901 called jamie lynn and told her that she would have to go by herself she was irate i think she knew he was staying because of me
5063902 around the same time jamie lynn publicly announced that she was pregnant he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex
5063903 at no point did he say kelli shes pregnant we cant do this we would hang out and hook up have sex
5063904 there is a coffee shop called brunos that is right across the street from the train station used in bad day at black rock it has to be the same diner coffee shop where spencer tracy with his only good arm karate chopped ernest borgnine in the throat
5063905 i have the laserdisc in my library and on one of the second audio programs the director john sturges explains at length how they used these abandoned railroad tracks they found in bishop california for the train scenes that fictitious coffee shop was actually a set on a back lot in burbank
5063906 im telling you they shot this film in gerlach nevada ive been there and ive seen the movie spencer tracy gets off the friggin train in gerlach
5063907 the production never set foot in nevada rent the laserdisc
5063908 ohhh tomahawk its right here just take i 80 east past
5063909 o h h h black rock thats easy just take i 80 east to fernley and take 447 north to gerlach itll take you right to the station where spencer tracy got off the train
5063910 that movie was shot in bishop california and on a back lot in burbank
5063911 the press conference for the land speed record is at the hotel you just left
5063912 you mean there are two guys trying to get the record
5063913 there is a british team that arrived last night in a massive cargo plane big enough to transport their crew and their race car
5063914 you mean that s why that russian plane is parked at the airport
5063915 duel in the desert 97 in the great american southwest however you see both breedlove and noble had ambition but were lacking three other elements critical to his success 1 venture capital 2 a crew 3 a design for a vehicle that would somehow subvert the laws of physics and aerodynamics as applied to the turbulence inherent in supersonic travel forces which would most likely launch and or shred the vehicle and its driver
5063916 at mach 1 youre either on the ground or youre ten miles in the air at a force of 40 gs
5063917 my immediate reaction was to distance myself from the project
5063918 to drive at supersonic speeds would clearly be extremely dangerous and indeed it could well be impossible i pointed out to richard that even keeping the car on the ground would be extraordinarily difficult
5063919 how can we keep a motorcar stable as it passes from the transonic to supersonic speeds
5063920 it will need two jet engines not for thrust but for weight drag and downforce they will have to live on either side of the cockpit
5063921 we will not finesse this per se but punch through the sonic barrier the center of gravity must be forward but no so fore that it actually burrows into the desert floor and resurfaces in eurasia
5063922 anybody can stick a jet engine on a chassis and light the fuse ron and i sketched out something and we thought my god this is really rather good this could work very well right twins engines aluminum wheels and then ken norris says there is no room for steering and it started to build from there
5063923 yeah ron its bitchin but where do we put the torsion bars
5063924 give us a few quid drop what youre doing and come with us to america to break the sound barrier
5063925 according to the weather statistics november should have the ideal combination of moderate temperature low wind low precipitation and few dust storms
5063926 the thing about the car you have to realize is that it did not have enough fuel on board to make a full land speed record run
5063927 they applied to have the rules changed so they could make one run timed over 1 100th of mile instead of a mile
5063928 having been involved in supersonic research since the days of the xs 1 rocket plane which i flew on the first supersonic flight on october 14 1947 there is no doubt in my mind that the rocket car exceeded the speed of sound on its run on december 17 1979
5063929 it degraded the whole land speed record business it took a wrong turn
5063930 the most outrageous thing about that whole project was that they wasted the time giving chuck yeager a ride in it the next day when they could have done it again properly
5063931 there was a water truck that was driving in the background
5063932 on this specific run when the operator was hand tracking the car the range finder targeted the water truck because it was a bigger target they had no actual third data point
5063933 the following day they had the car drive down the course and then took the data from the range of the other vehicle and substituted that into the calculations and then extrapolated data in that manner it is just so unbelievably flawed the manufacturer of the radar says its not even calibrated to do that youve got an uncalibrated radar hand operated with the third leg of the data being substituted can you imagine a guy trying to claim a drag racing record that way
5063934 all i can tell you is that the car went 666
5063935 ladies gentlemen and members of the press we are here to go mach 1 getting the record back does not interest us going 700 mph does not interest us we are here to go mach 1
5063936 two engines will give us a geometry which is much more stable so two engines for stability not for performance although the extra engine does no harm for performance whatsoever it enables us to get the weight well forward and the front wheels wide apart so that means the weight is between widely spaced front wheels stabilizing roll pitch and yaw simultaneously
5063937 i spoke to richard early on in his design process and hed said that hed decided they needed a twin engine design and that was where we differed
5063938 i said well i really dont think you need two and he said all land speed record cars have always underperformed i said i really havent found that to be true i had a j47 that i really think i could have reached 600 mph with maybe you experienced a lot higher drag numbers than i have in any case that was their philosophy really screw the car down just suck it down with a lot of ground effects just power it through and its a very stable way to do it
5063939 the problem i saw at black rock early on in this design concept was richard was sinking in
5063940 i went to ken norris and asked what their thrust 2s ground loadings were and he told me they were at 13 000 lbs of downforce i asked how they were distributed and he said no thats on the front wheels i said well youre aware that you guys are going to have so much rolling drag that you guys are never going to get the record he said theyve been discussing that and the only thing is that richard is very reluctant to point the car up any because of the flying problem
5063941 when we ran sonic 1 at 600 mph 1965 we had no weight on the front end im not saying thats a prudent way to do it but thats just the fact of the matter somewhere between 13 000 lbs and zero is the speed record
5063942 noble and his team are taking saturday off in observance of princess dis funeral
5063943 had 120 head of cattle this morning we counted 25
5063944 it makes me realize why we burn the man in the first place
5063945 there is a kind of craziness to britain and the british you know the mad dogs and englishmen and all that we go out and we do crazy things we invented a lot of the great sports of the world even bob sledding we havent got any snow but it took british people to go out to switzerland to invent crazy things like bob sledding speed records are all part of that same thing we kind of built an empire on this pioneering spirit im not saying everything weve done is right a lot of it was wrong but we do have this pioneering spirit as you have in the states part of it seems to be record breaking endeavor we just have that tradition
5063946 my best wishes to all involved in thrust sscs attempt to be the first through the sound barrier on land this project is a graphic illustration of british enterprise and engineering at its best good luck the whole country is behind you
5063947 its all about beating the british system if there were any british government involvement in thrust ssc we would end up with somebody on our board okay and this has to be a little organization that is very flexible and can dance and weave the last thing we want is that sort of person on the board
5063948 the aerodynamic forces would be simply enormous enough to lift the car and throw it around like an autumn leaf in a gale
5063949 the crux of the problem is knowing how the flow would behave underneath the car at sonic speeds and what would happen to shockwaves in that region
5063950 im really honored to be inducted into don garlits mall of blame i mean hall of shame i mean ball of flame
5063951 jockos not going to be in the drag racing hall of fame
5063952 im a loo ser and im half the man i appear to be im a lo o o o ser
5063953 are you looking at poor nog gra fee on whats that thing called
5063954 the spirit of america is that what this is about dont tread on me because i want to shoot guns in the desert this as a gesture
5063955 make time you cant make time time makes you what is this preoccupation with time anyway with speed mach 1 what is it with you people do you think that by sticking your head through the placenta of the spacetime continuum you are going to cheat mortality dont you know you are hastening it do you know it wasnt until caffeine and the clock were invented that the western world woke up from its hangover and built what we now know as civilization speed do you really think that is the way the winds are blowing do you realize you are upwind of ground zero
5063956 is that we built a car that was extremely unconventional and very complex we took it out there with a very green crew so we had the problems of sorting out the crew sorting out the car and even worse sorting out the desert it hammered the hell out of the car after we cleared 170 miles of stone and a lot of that was on our hands and knees
5063957 we had gone out there with a car with a lot of features that people said couldnt work rear wheel steering twin engines the computers
5063958 we went out there and we had a lot of problems with rear wheel steer and the engineering fixed it out there in the desert we got the car to work right out there in jordan everything that could have gone wrong with everything we had did and we fixed all of it the only thing we couldnt fix was the weather
5063959 some days we would have to abandon a run because i would spot camels straggling across the track or iranians rampaging across the desert smuggling massive amounts of petrol in a lorry tanker truck
5063960 the car has a lot more acceleration than a jet fighter
5063961 it has two jet fighter engines with half the weight of a jet fighter tremendous acceleration
5063962 you only run when the weather is nice everything is good for you and the vehicle is perfectly sensible
5063963 colours sounds temperatures pressures spaces times and so forth are connected with one another in manifold ways and with them are associated dispositions of mind feelings and volitions
5063964 sound occurs within spaces like natives vibrations interact in a circle
5063965 well craig feels it would be unsportsmanlike to impose on your moment of glory
5063966 richard and i both agreed ka buszzhh ka busszzh ka buszzh that andy green is the first person to break the sound barrier ka buszzhh ka busszzh ka buszzh
5063967 usac timing can you confirm that we did it within the hour
5063968 after the way he screwed up his chances of being the first guy to go supersonic drowning would have been a better fate
5063969 kant says that experience is the key to the universe
5063970 the faster you go the closer you are to god
5063971 ill say that was fast 450 chute out yes everything is wonderful
5063972 the car becomes unstable at around mach 0 85 as the airflow starts to go supersonic underneath the vehicle and requires very rapid precise steering inputs to keep it on the white guide line
5063973 the car becomes slightly more stable above mach 0 9 and can then be steered fairly accurately through the measured mile the shockwaves formed visible moisture on the front of the car which could be seen from the cockpit and which moved back along the body as the car accelerated
5063974 the car then remains reasonably stable as it accelerates through mach 1 with the rate of acceleration dropping off as the vehicle generates the huge shockwaves which cause the sonic boom
5063975 everybody has been bragging me included that well go out there and go supersonic when we really couldnt
5063976 this guy did it this has got to be the living end
5063977 were going to push this barn door through this other wall
5063978 if anybody ever asks you where you got this you tell them you dont know
5063979 if anybody ever asks me if i gave this to you i will tell them no
5063980 and this is not for publication but all of those recreational drugs and living in isolation in the high desert has fucked up his mind
5063981 its like this guy is talking about the car crash we drove through today
5063982 and everything will keep moving until the universe collapses into itself uh
5063983 it is a matter of chaos uh and prob uh bil uh tee as the tendency towards disorder is the most universal manifestation of times arrow our galaxy is traveling at 600 miles per second towards a collision with in fin uhh ty and oh bliv ee un uhh
5063984 and there is a man in the desert who endeavored to defy physics and common sense by uhh temp ting uhh to break the sound barrier in a stream uhh lined jet powered five wheeled ahh tow mow beel
5063985 he sounds just like a weird soda cracker version of cleavon little in that movie about benzedrine and muscle cars
5063986 you know the one where cleavon played the soul brother deejay
5063987 the vanishing point like he said the intersection of infinity and oblivion defying the physical laws of that intersection is what makes this whole trip fascinating
5063988 its like we as a society as individuals as gearheads as land speed record setters as wannabes or whatever go racing to the vanishing point like lemmings or something like splinters of iron drawn to a magnet no like an electron to the nucleus of an atom and when we get there we disappear like the collision of matter and anti matter
5063989 light is traveling uhh at the speed limit of the universe
5063990 there are no speed limits to the universe you luddite quaker flat earth philistine
5063991 by going mach 1 breedloves not only trying to subvert the passage of time and prove the cynics wrong he is a post atomic prometheus trying to steal fire from the gods yknow
5063992 uhh ccording to ernst mach and the mach principle acceleration uhh can be defined only relative to the distant stars the farthest corners of val hall uhh ernst mach thought the universe was mostly a vacuum he didnt take into account the dark matter that makes up ninety percent of the heavens
5063993 our favorite video was a stunning rendition of britney spears toxic by a skull head sporting a flowing red wig
5063994 i actually auditioned the year that britney and justin got in we lived in eureka california and we drove five hours to san francisco for the audition

5064001 miley cyrus she pranks her friends loves dancing to britney and cries just thinking about the people who care about her
5064002 their 2001 debut it was all a dream bad boy dropped when all four were 16 or younger and britney spears was still claiming her virginity
5064003 malia and sasha are very down on britney spears and paris hilton malia is the first one to change the channel if something suddenly comes on that she thinks is inappropriate
5064004 ach ich hab ja gar nicht nicht gefragt wie es dir eigentlich geht da sch m ich mich aber

5064018 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5064019 we went through processing and we got a home depot shopping cart size amount of usa clothing from ralph lauren its awesome
5064020 it is a dream its the whole reason i started cycling again and took a leave of absence from college and then the whole reason i went with slipstream because jv wanted to start a track squad that went with the road stuff
5064021 i dropped out of university after being there for 3 5 years near a degree and it was a big gamble you never know if you are going to make it so that is another aspect and just being away from home and normal things like having a girlfriend is impossible because you are being so selfish to yourself by following a training routine the lifestyle living for that moment and just training and training for it
5064022 i dont know how a 3km sprint means you can ride a madison or points race we might as well had a beer chugging contest whoever can down three beers and run around in a circle with an egg on a spoon
5064023 they seem kinda small now but if i did not make the team it would have been devastating i would have been a wreck i really dont know if i would have handled it right
5064024 there is a lot of family strife that comes into play in this one my cycling has always divided my family a lot i was always gone i can remember some large family arguments both extended and immediate family about it but for this to come full circle they can share in this and see that all the hardship we went through as a family has paid off this is bringing the whole family together my parents are divorced and never wanted to go to the same races but this is bringing everyone together and i really like that
5064025 my mother and father are both coming over to watch the games neither of them have ever been out of the country so i am honoured and excited for them because they get to travel and see something they never have before and they are going to see a madison event at the olympic level the only other time they might have seen one was when i was an amateur racing in t town
5064026 the coolest part about this is that any person who has helped me along the way or been a part of this in any way shape or form mentally with a positive word or financially this is for them they can be part of it not being there but knowing someone who is there this is for them
5064027 it was a really weird trials brad is my best friend he is the only guy other than my father and brother that i can say i love you on the phone danny pate thinks brad and i are like starsky and hutch driving our old mustangs
5064028 for brad it really hurt and i wish he was here maybe in 2012 hell be there even still he rode a hell of a trials only one second off and made the standard bobby had five months of training for that specific three kilometres while brad had a couple weeks and i just came back from europe i dont know how a 3km sprint means you can ride a madison or points race we might as well had a beer chugging contest whoever can down three beers and run around in a circle with an egg on a spoon
5064029 i thought there was going to be animosity but the four of us going to the trials all knew there were only going to be two of us going to the olympics we all worked towards making it happen and we are the first madison team to go to the olympics for the us and we all had a part in that we all qualified with points somewhere along the way to make it happen for that we are all connected now we have all moved on and the bottom line is that we are all on the same team
5064030 its not about me experiencing this so much as it is going there and doing the best i can and hopefully bringing back a medal
5064031 honestly i would not be going to the games if i didnt think i had a chance to medal
5064032 sure you go for the experience but im 27 and dont want to waste my time i really think we have a shot at it
5064033 the madison is a tactical race based on endurance speed tactics wit and technique you have 16 teams going full bore with hand exchanges that is 36 guys going crazy over 200 laps its a lot to handle
5064034 once we qualified for the team we immediately boarded a plane like two days later to go to a in italy we went to get some racing in on the track and work on hand exchanges it was really beneficial for that and because a lot of the guys racing in italy are the ones well be racing against in the games so it was good to see everybody we will be up against before italy i was coming off road training italy started off rough but by the end of the week i was cruising and exchanges were good
5064035 since returning from italy i spent the last month or so at altitude in colorado hitting the motor and doing some torque specific climbing as well as more than my fair share on the track with madison efforts its 50km long but really you are only racing for 25km because there are two guys racing so i would motor pace for 35km sprinting for ten laps it was pretty brutal
5064036 other than that i spent a lot of time up in the woods at 12 000 feet sleep high train low i went up there with danny pates dog kojak to sleep and come down in the morning it was great with colorados weather i should have grown a beard
5064037 im not nervous now like i was at worlds probably because i am much more prepared
5064038 its not a world championships it only comes once every four years it is so politically charged emotionally charged so many human characteristics involved and it is like becoming part of a new family some people work their entire lives for one shot and some are just not lucky there are athletes that are amazing and deserve to be here but for one reason or another at trials they just werent on form that particular day
5064039 well see the great wall and we were invited to the us ambassador to chinas house for an after party
5064040 you should have seen what happened at the white house
5064041 dude i was in the oval office for half an hour just chillin with the president well me and 16 other athletes we were around the desk and saw the artwork in the office he even knew i was on slipstream it was unreal then we had a rose garden affair and dinner with the president
5064042 they were on my bus this morning and we are flying with them instead of getting an emergency exit row i made sure to sit next to them because they are gorgeous im single i have to roll with it and make huff proud
5064043 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5064044 there is currently no scientific reason to prescribe dhea for any purpose whatsoever
5064045 the marketing of this supplements effectiveness far exceeds its science

5064048 we have decided to take full control of accommodating match officials in our approved hotels as well as improve their indemnities
5064049 this is a sharp departure from when the host club took responsibility for the referees accommodation and could induce these officials
5064050 once a referee is comfortable it would be difficult for any force to lure him into influencing match results
5064051 we have toiled really hard to improve our league but now it is important to fight for the integrity of football
5064052 this is a two in one fight because once a referee is clean then the clubs will be left with no option than play fairly as well
5064053 good pay solid security honesty and strong commitment all for the referees is the best way to ensure that football is kept free of corruption
5064054 tudo ocorreu quando a v tima pretendia transferir o carro um toyota hiace com a matr cula mmb 21 08 de uma faixa para a outra altura em que chegaram os pol cias paisana exigindo a carta de condu o n o se sabe como mas o ponto que sem nenhuma explica o os agentes da prm come aram a agredir o jovem com intuito de o arrastar at esquadra pr xima a cena foi de tal forma espectacular que dezenas de pessoas foram ao local para ver o que estava a acontecer e lamentar a atitude da pol cia as imagens do nosso colega carlos bernardo mostram os diferentes momentos do acto
5064055 and would you do me the honor of standing by my side
5064056 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5064057 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5064058 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5064059 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5064060 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5064061 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5064062 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5064063 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5064064 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5064065 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5064066 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5064067 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5064068 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5064069 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5064070 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5064071 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5064072 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5064073 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5064074 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5064075 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5064076 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5064077 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5064078 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5064079 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5064080 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5064081 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5064082 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5064083 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5064084 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5064085 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5064086 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5064087 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5064088 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5064089 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5064090 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5064091 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5064092 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5064093 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5064094 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5064095 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5064096 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5064097 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5064098 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5064099 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5064100 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5064101 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5064102 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5064103 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5064104 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5064105 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5064106 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5064107 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5064108 who are open to doing something on the production side
5064109 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5064110 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5064111 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5064112 een festival afsluiten klinkt mooi maar in de praktijk is het niet ideaal
5064113 mensen zijn moe denken aan waar hun auto ook alweer stond geparkeerd ik ben liever de voorlaatste act
5064114 we hebben alweer een paar jaar 2 nieuwe bandleden en de shows zijn beter dan ooit
5064115 thuis ben ik diep ongelukkig ik ga liever op tournee
5064116 negara kita telah terkungkung oleh pendidikan ambivalen pendidikan yang mendua dimana kinerja guru telah dibatasi oleh kungkungan kompetensi pelajaran yang tiap periode berganti arah berlabuh tanpa berkesinambungan
5064117 kita belum bisa merumuskan apa yang menjadi suatu kebutuhan dalam pendidikan pendidikan bukan hanya sekedar jejeran angka angka lebih dari itu pendidikan adalah suatu yang sakral tentu saja untuk mewujudkan kesakralan pendidikan tersebut diperlukan suatu sistem pendidikan yang mumpuni anggaran yang memadai serta aparatur yang memang mengerti kemana arah pelabuhan dunia pendidikan kita
5064118 secara pribadi saya menilai apa yang kita cita citakan tersebut belum kita capai secara baik
5064119 pendidikan di sumbar khususnya haruslah dibarengi dengan pendidikan kebudayaan karena kalau sudah demikian cikal cikal pengganti m hatta buya hamka akan kembali lahir dari generasi sekarang ataupun nanti generasi yang akan membawa kegemilangan dimasa depan
5064120 saya masih ingat dari apa yang pernah ditulis oleh seorang kepala sekolah sman 3 payakumbuh drs resnulius
5064121 dalam hal pemerintahan saya berharap pemerintah lebih mengkedepankan generasi muda
5064122 saya tidak ingin terlalu larut dalam pekerjaan dan kesibukan organisasi walaupun waktu saya memang banyak disita oleh pekerjaan tapi bagi saya keluarga adalah segala galanya setiap hari sabtu dan minggu pasti saya luangkan untuk keluarga saya bagaimanapun istri terutama anak saya yang sekarang sedang lucu lucunya dan sangat butuh bimbingan dari sosok seorang ayah keluarga adalah segala galanya saat penat dan letih menyerang sekujur tubuh sepulang bekerja sambutan derai tawa dari anak saya adalah jurus terjitu dalam mengusir segala kepenatan tersebut
5064123 bagi saya buku adalah jendela dunia dengan buku saya bisa tahu apa yang belum saya ketahui sampai sekarang membaca itu masih belum bisa saya tinggalkan sedikit waktu saya luangkan untuk membaca apa saja pokoknya menambah wawasan
5064124 sesibuk sibuknya saya yang namanya sholat lima waktu serta mengaji tidak pernah saya tinggalkan rasanya ada yang hilang kalau sholat saya tinggalkan
5064125 saya ini hanya orang kecil apa yang saya dapatkan adalah anugerah dari maha kuasa untuk itu apa salahnya kita membalas segala apa yang diberinya dengan bersedekap dan bersujud padanya
5064126 saya hanya ingin menjalani hidup sesuai apa yang saya mampu bekerja dengan jujur dan serius serta yang terpenting apa yang saya kerjakan tidak merugikan orang lain
5064127 saya ingin merubah nasib bangsa ini ke arah yang lebih baik karena bagaimanapun juga indonesia khususnya ranah minang adalah tanah kelahiran saya tempat saya menghabiskan waktu khelak dimasa tua akan saya jaga dan bela untuk selamanya
5064128 if you dont find god in the next person you meet it is a waste of time looking for him further
5064129 it is our duty as men and women to behave as though limits to our ability do not exist we are co creators of the universe
5064130 whatever you can do or dream you can begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it begin it now
5064131 the only people who get anywhere interesting are the people who get lost
5064132 and the day came when it was more painful to remain tight in a bud than the risk it took to blossom
5064133 education is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army
5064134 watch your thoughts they become words watch your words they become actions watch your actions they become habits watch your habits they become character watch your character it becomes your destiny
5064135 we all know that a rocket burns most of its fuel during the first few moments of flight as it overcomes inertia and the gravitational pull of the earth thats what its like for us as we launch our dreams into physical reality
5064136 at the critical juncture in all human relationships there is only one question what would love do now
5064137 success in life is a matter not so much of talent or opportunity as of concentration and perseverance
5064138 the road to success is not to be run upon by seven leagued boots step by step little by little bit by bit that is the way to wealth that is the way to wisdom that is the way to glory pounds are the sons not of pounds but of pence
5064139 in the private sanctuary of ones own conscience lies that spirit that determination to cast off the old person and to measure up to the stature of true potential
5064140 it is never too late to be what you might have been
5064141 you are here to enrich the world and you impoverish yourself if you forget that errand
5064142 it had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them they went out and happened to things
5064143 wherever you are is always the right place there is never a need to fix anything to hitch up the bootstraps of the soul and start at some higher place start right where you are
5064144 everything you need you already have you are complete right now you are a whole total person not an apprentice person on the way to someplace else
5064145 who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous
5064146 if you are making 150 000 a year or less as a family then youre middle class
5064147 it doesnt matter really what my definition of rich is
5064148 if countries dont have confidence in our ability to help them its going to be a much more dangerous world
5064149 what they say contains rules for martial arts what they mean contains rules for eastern martial arts that are magically somehow superior we did no research whatsoever and assume that europeans whose entire economy was based on warfare for centuries did not ever actually develop fighting styles of any kind
5064150 i cannot afford cool stuff from second sight and other books
5064151 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5064152 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5064153 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5064154 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5064155 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5064156 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5064157 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5064158 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5064159 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5064160 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5064161 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5064162 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5064163 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5064164 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5064165 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5064166 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5064167 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5064168 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5064169 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5064170 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5064171 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5064172 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5064173 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5064174 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5064175 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5064176 were not doing this to build up our egos if anything its going to deflate them
5064177 it was kind of an afterthought jeff and i thought hey it would be cool to climb fuji three times and we thought while making these plans we might as well do it for charity it makes a lot of sense
5064178 last year we got up to like 500 then we were thinking hey we can get up to 1 000 we blew right past 1 000 and it kind of grew exponentially without us really doing anything thats why we thought this year 10 000 was obtainable
5064179 ive been in japan for a couple of tours now ive climbed mount fuji a few times and ive raced up it a couple of times i was looking for a new miserable experience and this fits the bill
5064180 im sure were going to be challenged both physically and mentally its definitely going to be a test of our endurance but this event isnt about us or mount fuji its about the kids
5064181 let us run with endurance the race that is set before us looking to jesus
5064182 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
5064183 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians

5064191 kami kini akan menjalankan program reinventing government dari variable cost menjadi fix cost salah satunya yakni pengadaan mobil dinas ditiadakan di 2008 ini diganti dengan sistem sewa mobil
5064192 alhamdulillah produksi serta temuan komoditi lokal cabe raksasa kota payokumbuah kopay akan segera kita patenkan november mendatang saat ini tengah menunggu pengesahan lembaga lembaga terkait
5064193 the parellels are there and they are real especially in the way they both manipulated the press
5064194 we are trying not to tell the story of diana through georgiana but everyones aware and it would be a bit naive if they didnt know that diana is a direct descendent of georgiana
5064195 georgiana was born a spencer born in althorp and there are parallels she became a celebrity of her day she married a man who was complicated and distant and she married him very young
5064196 if people want to make comparisons thats fine but theres no way that we were trying to tell the story or manipulate the story to chime in with what people knew of dianas life
5064197 i thought he wont present this topic at all we thought that he would be just focussing very much on the oil the oil price
5064198 we find that it has been a bit difficult because sometimes if the singles they are not consensual if theyre not the one who would like to take this step they might feel very pushed towards it and we have had some disasters
5064199 i think its quite clear the government cares quite a bit about it and he cited all these examples from china as well as parental matchmaking sessions it was quite refreshing at least the government is thinking of different approaches to this
5064200 thats very good so we can exchange more ideas and we know different cultures and races as well and i think we also can learn from each other to improve ourselves
5064201 malay community doing more for their people as well as to look at a more progressive society and i thought that was good i think all of us not just the malay community but including the chinese community also need to look more towards a more integrated society
5064202 opening with the perfect foreshadowing device a summary of the legend of st valentine author jamieson wolf sets the reader up for an erotic supernatural romp thats going to have meaning the story valentine is fast paced and well told and offers not just a quick and lusty romance but a storyline that makes the reader sympathize with the characters plights and care about the point wolf wishes to make
5064203 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
5064204 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
5064205 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
5064206 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it

5064208 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5064209 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5064211 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5064212 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

5064217 there are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakably as a dictatorship one party rule executions without trial or with a mock trial for political offenses the nationalization or expropriation of private property and censorship a country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moral prerogatives any claim to national rights or sovereignty and becomes an outlaw

5064249 he made things come alive for the students i think
5064250 he had a wide capacity for new topics and stayed interested in so many things
5064251 there was just a remarkable remarkable quality about him that was different
5064252 you couldnt be in his presence very long and not be absolutely sure that you were in the presence of a fine man
5064253 i would tell my students you can tell when a man is a gentleman because he will do things like hold your elbow when you step off the curb just old school things like that

5064270 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system

5064334 we have decided to take full control of accommodating match officials in our approved hotels as well as improve their indemnities
5064335 this is a sharp departure from when the host club took responsibility for the referees accommodation and could induce these officials
5064336 once a referee is comfortable it would be difficult for any force to lure him into influencing match results
5064337 we have toiled really hard to improve our league but now it is important to fight for the integrity of football
5064338 this is a two in one fight because once a referee is clean then the clubs will be left with no option than play fairly as well
5064339 good pay solid security honesty and strong commitment all for the referees is the best way to ensure that football is kept free of corruption

5064346 first he would need a club to be interested in him and wanting to take him on

5064410 how do you respond to the argument that by pushing for georgia to be in nato by pushing for ukraine to be in nato by putting a missile defense system in czechoslovakia this was seen as belligerent and aggressive by putin and kind of brought him in

5064431 yeah i sold 25 books and gave out like 50 business cards for these books
5064432 i just wanted to say god bless you for taking the time to help us understand what prison is about i came here praying to god for some insight and you blessed us all
5064433 thank you that is what i came to do or at least try
5064434 i remember reading so many of your posts on the prison site and i was so disappointed when they banned you you were the best writer on the site i copy and print out all your posts and send it to my husband in prison
5064435 i hope you are blessed for what you do for us i hope you will be speaking tomorrow
5064436 well be there you were certainly worth this trip and i am going home with so much more faith in helping my son
5064437 i am trusting that somebody buys some of my books i came here in faith to not only help but to be helped my lord is it wrong for me to expect something for helping if i have been looking for a turnaround in my life
5064438 i am so glad i asked you to come speak to us lots of people told me this will be the talk of the prison support site they cant wait to hear you tomorrow
5064439 i im fine probably worn out for talking so much
5064440 i dont blame you just wanted to say god bless you for taking the time to explain some things about prison to us we really appreciate it
5064441 well i cant wait to hear you again tomorrow take care ok
5064442 hey i really appreciate what you did today there aint a lot of guys that talk about prison like you do
5064443 i mean it i have a prison ministry in tennessee and we have been ministering to inmates in prisons all over the state but it is so hard to get the inside word on what guys go through what you shared today opened a lot of understanding for me
5064444 the lords gonna bless you man you have been a blessing to a lot of people today
5064445 hey give me your email i would like to contact you about writing some posts for our prison ministry site
5064446 my god i could not sell one book not one i prayed to be able to do something that helps people i prayed to find a business where i could use my talents to help others and make some money and i did everything i could think of to believe that things would get better
5064447 whats the point of doing right whats the point of having faith whats the point of trusting when i am going to be rejected for being an ex felon i stayed in faith when i was continually banned and kicked out of all those prison support sites i stayed in faith when people make negative remarks on my own sites i stayed in faith when people promised to support me but only gave me lip service i hung in there because i believed that things were going to change for the better but nothing has changed and these people are as hypocritical as everybody else they dont care about me at all they only care about what they can get out of me

5064491 there are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakably as a dictatorship one party rule executions without trial or with a mock trial for political offenses the nationalization or expropriation of private property and censorship a country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moral prerogatives any claim to national rights or sovereignty and becomes an outlaw

5064504 en la nueva etapa no puede haber un reconocimiento de que se hac an cosas arbitrarias para una primera figura eso ser a m s dif cil
5064505 hay una movida muy fuerte para instalar que la econom a est en crisis y que la inflaci n se desborda esas ideas s lo consiguen penetrar porque la gente no le cree nada al indec ni las cifras de inflaci n ni las del crecimiento econ mico ni las de la pobreza y la indigencia
5064506 cualquier consultora dice que la inflaci n es del 30 por ciento y es cre ble por m s inconsistente que sea su medici n

5064509 el mercado donde prosperan formas ilegales de comercializaci n es el que se denominaba de oncol gicos que hoy se designa como medicamentos especiales o tratamientos especiales e incluye tambi n f rmacos para enfermedades como el sida la hemofilia o la esclerosis m ltiple p ginai12 abord aspectos de la comercializaci n de estos medicamentos el 28 de julio pasado las obras sociales m s importantes como pami o ioma no suelen entrar en este circuito pero la mayor a de las obras sociales trabajan con droguer as o distribuidoras que se dedican especialmente a estos negocios
5064510 estos medicamentos tienen precios alt simos y m rgenes de ganancia muy amplios un producto cuyo precio de venta al p blico es de supongamos mil pesos puede tener un costo de 40 o 50 pesos entonces la obra social puede comprar ese medicamento a 500 pesos y as presentar en su balance que lo consigui con un 50 por ciento de descuento esto parece una compra muy buena pero en realidad la operaci n se concret a 200 pesos con una ganancia de 300 pesos para el negociador de la obra social y la droguer a por su parte vendi a 200 el remedio que le hab a costado 40
5064511 una buena auditor a en obras sociales demostrar a f cilmente que estas compras no benefician a los afiliados pero efectuarla implicar a soportar reacciones inmediatas de los sectores entre ellos gremiales beneficiados por estas maniobras
5064512 estas droguer as obtienen mercader a a partir de robos de medicamentos procedentes de licitaciones en establecimientos p blicos
5064513 gracias a m dicos por ejemplo onc logos como el m dico administra l mismo la droga oncol gica solicita m s cantidad que la que realmente va a utilizar por ejemplo consignando que el peso en kilogramos del paciente es mayor que el verdadero o registrando una dosis inexacta los m dicos tambi n pueden pedir a la obra social adem s de la droga que realmente usan una mayor cantidad para acopio que eventualmente pasar al circuito ilegal todas estas maniobras les permiten guardar los medicamentos sobrantes y venderlos a precios relativamente bajos a una droguer a trucha que los har reingresar en el circuito de comercializaci n
5064514 adem s estas droguer as pueden comercializar productos obtenidos mediante robos con violencia de los piratas del asfalto pero no s lo trabajan con medicamentos robados
5064515 el negocio siempre tiene alguna pata en un laboratorio farmac utico legal puede ser que un familiar del due o de la droguer a sea ejecutivo del laboratorio a veces un gerente de un laboratorio despu s de d cadas de trabajar en la misma empresa arma su propia droguer a y le compra a ese mismo laboratorio la condici n para el funcionamiento de estas droguer as es contar con buenas vinculaciones en las dos puntas de la comercializaci n tienen que ser amigos del productor y del comprador los m rgenes de ganancia son tan grandes que pueden poner plata donde haga falta como por lo dem s a su manera sonri la fuente c hace la gran industria farmac utica al ofrecer beneficios a los m dicos
5064516 parte de esos troqueles sobrantes pueden pasar al mercado clandestino y servir para que medicamentos falsificados o pertenecientes a programas del ministerio de salud puedan entrar al sistema
5064517 tambi n hay un robo organizado de troqueles hay operaciones delictivas contra farmacias que est n primordialmente dirigidas a obtener troqueles
5064518 viene desde hace muchos a os pero se desarroll especialmente en la d cada de los 90 se al la fuente a en esa poca se hab an desarrollado sistemas poco transparentes en especial las mandatarias que intermediaban en las prestaciones incluso el pami lleg a entregar sus prestaciones a una mandataria vinculada con la industria farmac utica a partir de lo cual casi todas las obras sociales hicieron lo mismo esto cambi a partir de la crisis de 2001 desde entonces las principales obras sociales blanquearon sus contrataciones pero qued el mercado de los tratamientos especiales que mueve cantidades reducidas de medicamentos pero con precios alt simos ac siguen actuando los valijitas como se los llama en el ambiente
5064519 estas droguer as son un submundo muy chiquito de muy poquitas familias que est n desde hace much simos a os enquistadas en el estado pasan los gobiernos pero siguen las mismas tribus en un rubro donde los niveles de intermediaci n son millonarios

5064527 es una decisi n pol tica de este gobierno salvar a aerol neas pero el problema es la deuda que tiene la compa a hasta tanto no se finalice con la auditor a hoy los pasivos son un barril sin fondo
5064528 se hace lo mismo que en la d cada de 1990 cuando se privatiz aerol neas que era una sociedad del estado arse y se cre una nueva empresa arsa donde se transfirieron todos los aviones la infraestructura y los empleados en aquel momento el estado se hizo cargo de la deuda ahora se la dejar amos a los espa oles
5064529 estas son variantes alternativas que estamos proponiendo pero le dejamos al estado la responsabilidad de llevar adelante el plan
5064530 si se tienen en cuenta todos los aviones que operan aerol neas y austral no existe lugar en el mundo para revisar todos esos aviones de un d a para el otro
5064531 hoy la empresa brasile a opera a menos del diez de su antigua capacidad el principal acreedor en ese caso era brasil as y todo se cerr la empresa la diferencia es que en el pa s vecino existe un mercado desarrollado que pudo seguir abasteciendo los viajes de cabotaje
5064532 los gremios est n contentos con recibir el 10 por ciento de la empresa en concepto del programa de propiedad participada ppp

5064539 conoce el pa o y sabe que no tiene tiempo para armar algo serio
5064540 sobre todo en las localidades del interior que despu s del conflicto con el campo no quieren saber m s nada con el gobierno
5064541 la verdad es que a felipe nunca le interesaron las cuestiones de la interna del pj bonaerense pero esta vez est analizando el panorama

5064546 coincidimos en que estamos en un momento complicado complejo donde las miradas sobre las fortalezas y las debilidades tambi n son parad jicas
5064547 argentina sigue teniendo una deuda externa importante en t tulos que cotizan en el mercado de manera que si se quiere condicionar la pol tica interna y ya no se tiene al fmi la derecha recurre a otras instituciones desarrolladas en la d cada del 90 como estas calificadoras de riesgo buscan un ajuste aunque ya no usan esa palabra ahora hablan de service a la econom a le hace falta un service es lo que dicen

5064552 hay un imaginario residual del conflicto del campo que la carta debe tomar tomar todo aquello que devino en que el gobierno est sitiado
5064553 la reestatizaci n de aerol neas argentinas debe ser apoyada por lo que representa que es la soberan a nacional adem s de la defensa de nueve mil puestos de trabajo
5064554 el problema fundamental de la pol tica argentina es el problema de la construcci n pol tica ah est nuestra mayor debilidad tenemos a favor nuestro que la oposici n pasa por un estado lamentable cuando elisa carri dice junio va a ser malo julio va a ser bueno como una parapsic loga se puede ver ese estado lamentable en toda su dimensi n

5064571 aun cuando no nos pongamos de acuerdo en la escuela debemos reflexionar con seriedad y rigor las decisiones participativas traen consigo consecuencias y asumirlas implican responsabilidades individuales y colectivas
5064572 dispuso que ante futuras p rdidas de d as de clase los mismos se recuperar n los s bados o se extender el ciclo lectivo hasta diciembre pr ximo seg n lo decida cada instituci n

5064582 no s si se va a meter en pol tica porque los temas agropecuarios no est n resueltos hoy por hoy lo queremos en el mbito gremial
5064583 me parece que si se lanza va a estar m s cerca del peronismo disidente que de otro espacio
5064584 de angeli es un cuadro s que no quiere ser legislador hay dudas de si no quiere ser candidato a gobernador

5064598 decir que se ha avanzado un 50 por ciento en la reconstrucci n es una gran mentira del gobierno no se ha avanzado ni el 15 por ciento
5064599 el claramente quiere asegurase que va a durar quiere crear condiciones m nimas de gobernabilidad para superar las crisis que seguramente vendr n muy r pido no es poca cosa cambiar de gobierno despu s de 60 a os poner gente nueva en todos los ministerios son demasiadas cosas juntas adem s con la inexperiencia de no haber estado nunca en el poder primero quiere afirmarse con los dos pies sobre la tierra acaba de asegurarse una ligera mayor a parlamentaria haciendo un complejo malabarismo con el oviedismo y los liberales pero no tiene parlamentarios de izquierda hay nada m s que cuatro y en el congreso hay 80 diputados y 45 senadores
5064600 la cosa es tirar para m s adelante todo lo que huela a conflicto ideol gico como la reforma agraria pero en los nombramientos en las reas mas lgidas que son agricultura industria y comercio y econom a que ac llamamos hacienda eligi gente previsible y conservadora como si quisiera mandar mensajes tranquilizadores a los que m s temen un giro a la izquierda como los agroexportadores los industriales los militares etc tera claramente busca postergar problemas de fondo
5064601 a l le encanta salir en la foto con ch vez y con evo
5064602 pero internamente no tiene mucha trascendencia nadie tiene miedo en este momento a una radicalizaci n ideol gica no puede depende demasiado de los liberales en el parlamento y los liberales son reacios a abandonar su conservadurismo
5064603 si lo pudiera hacer ser a claramente m s socialista l nea radical
5064604 ah van a empezar sus problemas va a tener que definirse ante los conflictos ideol gicos de fondo hasta ahora lo nico que ha decidido es patear todo para adelante por lo menos cien d as si tuviera la intenci n de polarizar la lucha por la tierra hubiera nombrado a un ministro de agricultura socialista pero nombr a un ex diputado liberal de san pedro los liberales est n felices llegan al semi poder despu s de 60 a os disfrutan de los cargos ministeriales el ambiente est tranquilo tienen la ventaja de que el partido colorado sigue en un estado de soponcio como un boxeador groggy
5064605 no han podido reaccionar est n sumidos en conflictos internos bastante graves cambiaron el presidente del partido tres veces en unas horas con derivaciones judiciales de saparecieron de la tapa de los diarios y de la escena pol tica pero se van a reciclar son los peronistas paraguayos van a defender sus intereses est n creando sindicatos de empleados p blicos a todo vapor negociando contratos colectivos para mantener sus privilegios va a haber un destape de casos de corrupci n muy grandes que van a crear conflictos judiciales que se van a transformar en conflictos pol ticos
5064606 y la justicia es colorada pero hasta ahora lugo viene haciendo equilibrio y por la reacci n que han tenido hasta ahora sus nombramientos y como se repartieron las cr ticas entre la izquierda y la derecha da la pauta de que marcha m s o menos por el centro
5064607 ese tema nunca se hab a tocado ac en una campa a prosigue el analista y no s por qu se ha silenciado es un gran m rito de lugo haber colocado en la agenda el debate sobre la soberan a energ tica pero tambi n aqu va a ser prudente no va a haber medidas radicales te das cuenta por el director de itaip que ha elegido que es m s bien conservador
5064608 es que no tiene margen para una estrategia m s radical la v a paraguaya va a ser una v a progresista pero muy lejos de venezuela o bolivia y l va a apuntar a ser como tabar v zquez el gran problema va a ser c mo mejora las vidas de dos millones y medio de pobres sobre una poblaci n de seis millones
5064609 un aporte importante que puede hacer lugo es cerrar los circuitos subterr neos que unen al partido colorado con el estado se trata de un estado muy patrimonialista donde no queda muy claro qu pertenece al estado y qu pertenece al partido lugo tendr un margen de acci n porque lo nico bueno que hered de nicanor duarte frutos es un crecimiento del 6 5 el m s alto de los ltimos 40 a os y la estabilidad macroecon mica paraguay es el quinto exportador mundial de soja y el a o pasado hubo buen clima y este a o tambi n se espera una buena cosecha
5064610 lugo no va a poder ignorar el conflicto principal que es la estructura feudal de la distribuci n de la tierra hay soja por todos lados que genera muchos ingresos que no se redistribuyen porque los agroexportadores generan muy poco empleo y por lo tanto sus ganancias no gotean a la poblaci n para gran parte de la izquierda el gran enemigo es el latifundista sojero que en gran parte es oriundo de brasil habla portugu s y mantiene su cultura ocupan grandes extensiones de tierra cerca de la frontera con brasil y ac los llaman los brasiguayos si lugo pretende revertir esta situaci n no s c mo lo har ni a cambio de qu
5064611 lugo siempre ha sido un defensor de la toma de tierras y hasta lo reafirm siendo presidente electo lo cual caus un gran revuelo pero nadie conoce su plan de reforma agraria no lo ha anunciado tampoco se sabe bien de qui n son las tierras porque se han vendido tantas veces y hay tanta corrupci n por de pronto anunci un catastro rural y con eso va a ganar unos meses
5064612 lugo habla poco es un obispo es bastante inescrutable en un mismo d a le da una palmadita en la espalda al empresario liberal y un gui o al compa ero de izquierda tiene aliados que est n en los ant podas de poder pero no se fue nadie de su alianza es un equilibrista impresionante y es muy carism tico aparece en ponchos y ojotas pero sin ser tan ex tico como evo morales comunica de una manera muy rara nombra a un ministro cada cinco o seis d as y despu s desaparece tiene un entorno peque simo de dos sacerdotes y un asesor pol tico y pasa d as sin hablar con la prensa ni con sus aliados nadie sabe d nde va a dormir estilo fidel castro para en distintas casas y ya avis que no va a vivir en la residencia presidencial vuelve locos a los pol ticos es dif cil de definir
5064613 si no se vuelve loco lugo va a hacer cambios important simos vamos a entrar en el siglo xxi salte ndonos el siglo xx hay optimismo la gente m s que votarlo vot por hartazgo en contra del partido colorado m s que optimismo hay una expectativa grande mucha ansiedad y esa ansiedad le puede jugar en contra todo es posible va a ser divertido
5064614 los campesinos los sin tierra los ni os que se merecen lo mejor de nuestro trabajo por ellos da gusto conversar con la gente d a y noche y dormir pocas horas queremos mirar el futuro y que lo hagamos todos juntos

5064637 its a mystery to us how you can have the number of inspectors that were practically living in that building and have that level of disaster
5064638 it exposed an area that the city had never looked at this comprehensively when we looked at it we found a lot of areas that could be improved

5064660 the volunteer is usually the top level of our data
5064661 things changed things so extensively between versions that it didnt pay to convert
5064662 most organizations dont have a high powered techie to implement a crm for them and finding a sophisticated volunteer is not possible for most organizations
5064663 nearly the entire crm would need to be rewritten to upgrade thats why the web is so attractive
5064664 software as a service removes you from the software upgrade game
5064665 crm made the most sense because it can adapt to many uses
5064666 training on how to use the crm has been very important
5064667 there are those who use it and those who dont training closes the gap and encourages staff to use it
5064668 its not directly keyed to what we do or how we look at information
5064669 really take a hard look at what you want crm for
5064670 there will be things you cant do in it so you have to figure out whats important to your staff and your organization
5064671 if your organization wants to have a good record of the people who support you and how they support you you have to have it all in one place also if you want an organizational memory you have to have a crm
5064672 crm is ultimately a huge help for the organization youre losing value if you dont track this stuff
5064673 backups were a big problem we lost tons of information during a crash before we moved to salesforce
5064674 the risk in investing in crm is that it is not necessarily easier to use than your old system
5064675 in many ways it is more difficult because it demands so much more information
5064676 some of our most valuable contacts arent in our crm because folks are too busy to record what they do and who they interact with leadership must be brought in and push people to do it if youre not going to commit to fully tracking things you should scale your database to what is realistic if youre not using it dont build it
5064677 it would have been better to wait until the new person came on and understood what was needed so that they could drive the process
5064678 we saw that we werent raising as much money online
5064679 its easier to break through the clutter of other organizations
5064680 you need to motivate an event manager to care about whether a constituent that comes to their event stays with the organization
5064681 traditionally they dont care because all they are responsible for is how much money they raise from the event
5064682 the database providers today dont have data integration as a core competency they can customize products but they cant tell you the best ways to manage your data and what fields are important
5064683 estamos cerca de la clasificaci n sabemos que no tenemos techo
5064684 when it comes to voting unemployment doesnt matter inequality doesnt matter in the united states growth of real after tax income does matter the stock market does matter
5064685 people that think that the fed is some kind of political creature are mistaken they do a disservice to assume that and its very unfortunate that some people assume that
5064686 there wont be any reason to change anything at this meeting
5064687 i doubt a second stimulus package is going to happen but its rarely prudent to overestimate the wisdom or fiscal prudence of politicians during an election year
5064688 if its going to happen it must happen in september
5064689 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites

5064710 vamos aproveitar nosso tempo para avaliar que conseq ncias ter o as a es da r ssia em nossas rela es com este pa s
5064711 desta vez espero que digam de verdade o presidente russo deve demonstrar que pode cumprir sua palavra ou de outra maneira o povo se perguntar se pode confiar na r ssia
5064712 no meu ponto de vista os russos provavelmente ficar o na defensiva e tomar o mais tempo do que gostar amos acho que devemos continuar mantendo a press o e nos assegurar que cumprem com o acordo assinado no tempo previsto

5064714 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog

5064734 russia was clearly emboldened by our obvious weakness we are hobbled in the world and divided at home dependent on others for our energy much of our food manufacturing and even for our financing we are going deeper into debt with each passing day our future mortgaged with commitments we cannot possibly keep and yet the solutions our leaders offer are no match for the scale of the problems we dont even demand that obama and mccain offer honest ideas that would halt our alarming decline let alone put us on the path to security and prosperity
5064735 the law is not the survival of the better or the stronger it is the survival of those which are constitutionally fittest to thrive under the conditions in which they are placed and very often that which humanly speaking is inferiority causes the survival
5064736 people are talking about runs they havent seen for a decade or more
5064737 what were seeing this year is an increase in marine survival we dont know why theres a whole new international research program gearing up to try and find answers about whats happening to the fish in the ocean but whatever has changed the grilse are back this year the numbers of salmon are consistent with other years and what we should see is a big increase in large salmon next year
5064738 theres usually a good relationship between grilse returns one year and salmon returns the following year
5064739 this year salmon runs are average but if grilse have good survival we hope that salmon will also have good survival and wed see more of those next year

5064749 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
5064750 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
5064751 the heroes didnt rationalize cheating the way others did they didnt come up with excuses and say it was ok because lots of other students were doing it
5064752 these 29 percent are like undecided voters they would be an especially good focus for intervention

5064762 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5064763 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission

5064776 theres been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading
5064777 steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister and recent weeks now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion speak more of putin having his hand on the
5064778 i think the president has been as disturbed as anyone by the actions that russia has taken and by the aggressiveness that theyve shown
5064779 i think that weve seen a hard side to putin over the years after all the speech that he gave at the conference a year ago february was very tough and very aggressive
5064780 and yet we have seen other actions where he has been willing to work with the west and work with the president on various issues
5064781 we thought that they were headed in that positive direction despite some negative signals that we received over time we now have to re evaluate all of that
5064782 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some assurance

5064805 with like minded and compliant subordinates who did not grasp the importance of the principles of war the complexities of iraq or the human dimension of warfare
5064806 tied the hands of commanders while our troops were in contact with the enemy
5064807 the most significant transformation in the american conduct of war since world war ii and the invention of the atomic bomb was not technological but cultural social and political the removal of the american people from the conduct of war

5064829 voy a ser un se or y no criticar a michelin
5064830 hasta final de temporada voy a ser un se or y no voy a criticar a michelin no ha sabido encontrar el neum tico ideal pero no puedo criticar no puedo morder la mano de mi due o yamaha no trabajo para ellos ellos prometieron que iban a invertir tantos millones y no s si lo han hecho quiz s pero no han sabido alcanzar los resultados lo que es verdad es que los neum ticos son diferentes al a o pasado y parece que van peor
5064831 michelin nos dijo que habr a problemas porque el neum tico de delante no durar a casi nada confi bamos que ese problema no existir a este fin de semana parece ser que es el asfalto el que causa estos problemas pero llevamos dos carreras malas quiz en misano estaremos mejor no me voy a desanimar
5064832 estoy contento y tranquilo en la moto he demostrado que tengo un buen ritmo de carrera y cuando las circunstancias est n de nuestro lado estaremos luchando por la victoria
5064833 es para estar decepcionado con esta posici n tenemos material y calidad para estar m s delante viendo c mo ha ido todo el fin de semana y viendo el rendimiento del neum tico delantero que nos ha ofrecido michelin es lo m ximo que pod amos hacer
5064834 me he equivocado en la salida he salido mal y no he querido arriesgar mucho en las frenadas para adelantar a los que me estaban molestando y no me dejaban ir m s r pido pero no he pasado miedo lo bueno que tengo es que soy como un diesel y voy cada vez mejor
5064835 und das ergebnis ist sicherlich nicht das was ich haben will ich m chte nicht am hinteren ende der top 15 k mpfen m ssen genauso wenig wie yamaha oder mein team das ist einfach entt uschend ich kann lediglich hinausgehen und das maximum geben egal was ich unter mir habe genau das habe ich gemacht dieses team und yamaha verdienen eine bessere platzierung das war heute einfach nicht genug
5064836 es w re leicht jetzt den kopf h ngen zu lassen aber ich war noch nie so ein fahrertyp
5064837 es w re leicht jetzt den kopf h ngen zu lassen aber ich war noch nie so ein fahrertyp damit fange ich auch jetzt nicht an ich war recht zufrieden mit meinem start hatte aber in den ersten runden meine liebe not mit dem vorderrad und merkte recht schnell dass ich nicht mehr leisten konnte sehr entt uschend denn so bin ich aus den top 10 gerutscht und das war vor der saison mein gro es ziel
5064838 wir m ssen als team weiterhin hart schuften und darauf hoffen dass michelin den hebel f r den rest der saison noch einmal umlegen kann sodass wir wieder in die top 10 zur ckkehren und die moral im team anheben k nnen colin hatte sogar noch mehr schwierigkeiten als ich es muss echt bel f r ihn gewesen sein aber so ist die lage nun einmal wir geben einfach weiter gas und sehen dann wohin uns das f hrt
5064839 ich konnte direkt hinter james ganz deutlich sehen dass er probleme mit dem vorderrad hatte genau wie wir erwartet hatten ich dachte dennoch dass ich eine ganz gute pace zusammenkriegen w rde aber das ist leider nicht passiert ich hatte einfach nicht das n tige vertrauen in die reifen um eine h rtere gangart einzulegen ich gab zwar reichlich gas wurde aber nicht schneller
5064840 james konnte mich recht leicht stehen lassen und meine probleme wurden gr er ich wollte aber drau en bleiben und f r meine tech 3 jungs und yamaha alles geben sie arbeiten immer wie verr ckt um mir zu helfen ich konnte aber leider nichts ausrichten gegen rennende habe ich mich dann entschieden mehr auf risiko zu gehen und war dann etwas schneller konnte aber niemanden mehr erreichen
5064841 ich hatte zuletzt eine schlechte serie k mpfe aber noch immer um den vierten platz in der weltmeisterschaft und ich werde weiter k mpfen wir brauchen aber dringend gro e fortschritte von michelin der gute saisonstart scheint schon ganz sch n weit zur ckzuliegen wir haben mit michelin eine menge arbeit vor uns um diese schwierigkeiten zu l sen das heute hat mir n mlich gar nicht gefallen
5064842 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days

5064852 fires in the borjomi forests are still continuing there was unfortunately no progress in the fight against the fires

5064860 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5064861 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5064862 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5064863 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5064864 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5064865 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5064866 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5064867 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

5064870 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5064871 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5064872 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5064878 gordon made a huge error initially by going for the humanitarian angle this is a stratightforward act of aggression by russia not an international development issue cameron sussed that and saw that john mccain was right about where the story was going this trip by cameron just makes us look wet and dithering

5065023 neither of them wants to be too close to the u s nor too distant from iran
5065024 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5065025 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the prime minister that is the stumbling block

5065028 from here it is a continuation with my goal of raising the sport of swimming as high as i can in the us 70 000 fans will be watching the relay at the nfl ravens game tonight the team based in his home town of baltimore and it has been shown at sports events across the country
5065029 i have heard people say its crazy they are out to dinner and swimming is on the television
5065030 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination that is something i have learned
5065031 after the 200 im i started to think we could get there that was when i allowed myself to believe a little bit it was pretty exciting

5065040 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
5065041 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special
5065042 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the project it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us
5065043 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
5065044 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumour but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumour which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
5065045 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic

5065048 this year the smell is so nauseating we cannot keep our resort open
5065049 most often we cannot confirm the odor presence part of that problem i believe is that sometimes the odor is somewhat transient it tends to be a working case odor if a particular load of waste may come in
5065050 close it up or they are trying to reach out and sell it right now and do whatever they can do to rob peter to pay paul then youre going to get a conglomerate like waste management the big guys who are going to come in and if you think you dont like the rules now wait till you get their rules
5065051 i think most doggy parents tend to be a bit overprotective about their furry children and i am by far no exception

5065063 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5065064 history is often made in remote and far off places
5065065 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5065066 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5065067 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5065068 democrats should take a deep breath and realize that there are a group of voters who wont make up their mind about a candidate until deep in the fall
5065069 and there are 18 states that are battlegrounds for a reason and theyll be decided by 2 to 4 points i dont care about national polls
5065070 i think senator obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had
5065071 florida has not yet been locked down by either candidate or all but won by either candidate but i think obamas inability to prove his experience or prove that he owns a political issue far more than mccain is a real problem for him
5065072 the one area he still needs credibility in is experience and picking an evan bayh or a joe biden as vice president would help a lot with that
5065073 it wouldnt be bad if he came out early and said who his secretary of defense and secretary of state would be that would address and stabilize the concerns about his experience
5065074 in rural parts of georgia and the south there is still some fear about people who look different from themselves
5065075 and theres also healing left to do among women who wanted to see the day that a woman was elected president
5065076 i would really like to see him do things in tennessee that would help in other working class and blue collar places like ohio
5065077 job security and health care are huge here he needs to come to the aisle of home depot and show them that a harvard graduate which i am as well knows how to help them
5065078 his message is the right one but he needs to turn up the volume and sharpen it a bit because these are voters who care a great great deal about the future of the economy
5065079 he has to convince them he is ready for that huge task
5065080 why the hell did it have to end this way god what are you doing
5065081 you have the option of staying in the home with windows closed or find somewhere else to be for the day

5065101 saya telah membanding hasil hasil kajian saya tentang hadis dengan yang telah saya kemukakan dalam bahagian mengenai quran dan sains moden hasil hasil perbandingan ini berdiri sendiri sebagai bukti pernbezaannya sungguh menakjubkan di antara ketepatan maklumat yang terkandung dalam quran bila dibandingkan dengan pengetahuan moden sains dan kesangsian yang amat ketara pada setengah kenyataan hadis berhubung dengan perkara perkara saintifik pernbandingan ini menonjolkan perbezaan yang amat ketara di antara karangan karangan zaman ini iaitu hadis yang bertaburan dengan kenyataan kenyataan yang tidak tepat dari segi sains dan quran kitab wahyu bertulis yang bersih dari kesilapan kesilapan ini

5065108 should be based on the criteria of proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench some of the worst damage has been done by legislating from the bench and by the way justices alito and roberts are two of my most recent favorites
5065109 one of the most important jobs of the supreme court is to guard against the encroachment of the executive branch on the power of the other branches i think he has been a little bit too willing or eager to give an administration whether mine or george bushs more power than the constitution originally intended

5065142 we the people in order to form a more perfect union
5065143 two hundred and twenty one years ago in a hall that still stands across the street a group of men gathered and with these simple words launched americas improbable experiment in democracy
5065144 the document they produced was eventually signed but ultimately unfinished
5065145 of course the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our constitution a constitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law a constitution that promised its people liberty and justice and a union that could be and should be perfected over time
5065146 and yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the united states
5065147 this was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this campaign to continue the long march of those who came before us a march for a more just more equal more free more caring and more prosperous america
5065148 in hindsight we probably didnt have to give him up to get pau

5065151 i think the other team knows the other one very well and knows what the other players want to do
5065152 who knows maybe there will be surprises tomorrow but i dont believe it
5065153 the good thing is that we are defending with the whole team that we have a good midfield pressure but yes our defense is standing up very well they win many balls and when they dont goalkeeper nadine angerer is there
5065154 we want to attack more and play forward and i think that the brazilian team is the same
5065155 i dont think im the best forward in the world im just here to do a job for the team
5065156 especially because we had to go 120 minutes brazil only needed to play 90
5065157 but its not going to be an easy match no matter what
5065158 its going to come down to details which ever team is able to perform better at the time will come away with the victory
5065159 its a weakness that we have so many goal scorers its also a strength now we can get a goal from anyone
5065160 abbys one of a kind she brings something different than i bring
5065161 because we dont have abby others of us have had to step up and i think theres proof of that in recent games
5065162 were playing more as a team since we havent had abbys presence
5065163 we dont look back on years past we have a 1 0 victory and we have to learn from that
5065164 they needed a must win game against norway with a lot of goals and they did it then they had a must win game against china where the entire crowd was cheering for china and did it
5065165 each game weve gotten better weve been adjusting without abby
5065166 its all about the journey and abbys a big part of the journey

5065192 if anybody had asked us a couple of months ago whether or not we would like to be where we are today which from what we can tell is a pretty even race we would have been pretty thrilled
5065193 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
5065194 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
5065195 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
5065196 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated

5065245 i have traditionally played golf on fear of failure i believe i need to move to a level where i can use confidence as a way to play better
5065246 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me earlier in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill

5065261 in terms of car set up we need to remember that like monaco the track will be both green and dusty on the opening day of practice
5065262 that sometimes tempts you into playing with set up more than you would like so you need to resist that temptation and let the track come to the car
5065263 finally anybody whos studied any onboard footage of the circuit will be mindful of the proximity of the concrete barriers in certain areas clearly well be packing plenty of spares but hoping we wont need to use them

5065275 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5065276 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time

5065351 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5065352 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
5065353 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5065354 there are ups and downs with a slight advantage to obama
5065355 if anybody had asked us a couple of months ago whether or not we would like to be where we are today which from what we can tell is a pretty even race we would have been pretty thrilled
5065356 you know all the jonas brothers is there one that you are closer to than the other
5065357 no i mean i think kevin is like another brother to me so he is pretty awesome

5065362 our business continues to expand rapidly in europe which is now icebreakers largest market our european outdoor customer is highly discerning when it comes to his or her apparel and also looking for companies that care about social and environmental ethics and animal welfare
5065363 there had been no major innovation in outdoor clothing since synthetics took over from traditional wool
5065364 icebreakers merino product worked the brand had style and the swiss love new zealand and nature and are innovative enough to give a good proposition a chance
5065365 icebreaker is a company with a product and a set of beliefs that i completely identify with awe of nature creativity integrity work hard play hard ethic the importance of people and having fun and that cheeky kiwi sense of humor the company oozes integrity from the simple but incredible fabric that nature provided to the talented group of people who throw their hearts into their work life and finally to the imagery and story telling of the brand thats why this company rocks and why the brand is going places makes me proud to be a kiwi

5065379 bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than defuse them
5065380 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
5065381 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
5065382 more or less on the same page in decrying the aggression
5065383 the new john mccain has embraced those kind of tactics
5065384 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed be in a state of war and clearly thats not what we want
5065385 please mr putin leave the little country alone pretty please pretty please with a waffle on top

5065393 there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
5065394 without the help of my team mates this isnt possible
5065395 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5065396 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had
5065397 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5065398 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
5065399 its a beautiful thing i am so proud to be a part of this relay team
5065400 it wasnt like we were doing this for michael but its an honour to be part of it it would have been something if we hadnt done it

5065405 wir n hern uns der entscheidung den stecker zu ziehen f r das webcasting ist es eine art show down
5065406 unsere k nstler und rechteinhaber verdienen es f r das blut und den schwei den sie bei der herstellung der kernprodukte dieser gesch fte vergossen haben angemessen bezahlt zu werden
5065407 no entiendes realmente algo a menos que seas capaz de explicarselo a tu abuela
5065408 hey i got this oh wait no i dont wait argh screw it
5065409 i think i can convince people on the other side of the table that we do not need tax
5065410 there was a brief five year period when we could get away with treating russia like jamaica thats over now we have to deal with them like grown ups who have more nuclear weapons than anybody except us
5065411 its too early to be overly confident about the economy
5065412 i still think inflation is the greatest risk to the economy
5065413 inflation is starting to spill over into other goods and services
5065414 a year from today well still be talking about financial problems its not going away
5065415 if mr phelps can handle eight gold medals he can handle anything
5065416 we would as part of our ongoing crackdown on hoon driving consider this
5065417 anything that protects the community from the scourge of hoon drivers the liberal party would support
5065418 the evidentiary value of it may be negligible unless its integrity can be assured
5065419 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
5065420 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
5065421 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
5065422 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
5065423 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
5065424 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
5065425 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits
5065426 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
5065427 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
5065428 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
5065429 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
5065430 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
5065431 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward
5065432 but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety
5065433 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led
5065434 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5065435 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5065436 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5065437 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5065438 just like a mass on a spring the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins of singlets and triplets in the organic led
5065439 we need to design nanorectifiers that go with our nanoantennas
5065440 our results indicate that needle free nasal immunization using a combination of nanoemulsion and hepatitis b antigen could be a safe and effective hepatitis b vaccine and also provide an alternative booster method for existing vaccines
5065441 our studies however indicate no inflammation and no evidence of the vaccine in the olfactory bulb
5065442 o governo russo tem a inten o de enviar uma frota naval pelo caribe caso venham pelo caribe os receberemos ser bem vinda a frota russa que queira vir por aqui em visita de amizade e de trabalho
5065443 estamos avaliando a compra de submarinos russos para custodiar nossas guas territoriais assim como a poss vel aquisi o de avi es de carga
5065444 why are we doing this i dont want to go out into this again i think ill take a zero day and recoup
5065445 n o queremos agredir outros pa ses mas nos defenderemos em caso de agress o

5065447 yeah we just had a tornado with 105 mph winds back home
5065448 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5065449 people are playing in their head considering what happened the last time
5065450 rumores de que uno de los jonas brother es gay
5065451 eigenlijk is vroeg spelen een voordeel want dan kan je nog indruk maken op mensen in de loop van de avond zijn ze vaak al helemaal murw van alles wat ze hebben gezien
5065452 ik dronk toen ook nog veel of in elk geval genoeg dus dat kan het zijn geweest nu ben ik nuchter dus misschien dat ik het nu wel onthoud
5065453 misschien moet het publiek gaan zitten of een slang vormen
5065454 het is goed om te spelen voor etenstijd want door de honger zit je op een ander energieniveau na het eten is het beest in je getemd
5065455 ik wilde geen lange naam zoals the end of silence en jim vond ik cool klinken
5065456 jim zou je ergens kunnen zien als een alter ego maar ik noem het liever een gemoedstoestand ik heb veel schizofrene kanten en als ik die allemaal een naam zou moeten geven ben ik wel even bezig
5065457 een festival afsluiten klinkt mooi maar in de praktijk is het niet ideaal

5065462 should and will if we have anything to do with it have political implications for the awls position as part of the workers movement
5065463 matgamnas filthy apologia should have no place in the workers movement
5065464 they seem to have harnessed all their instruments of national power military diplomatic information in a very disciplined way
5065465 it appears this was well thought out and planned in advance and suggests a level of coordination in the russian government between the military and the other civilian agencies and departments that we are striving for today
5065466 this exercise was exactly what they executed in georgia just a few weeks later

5065483 if nobody expects us in nato why should we be happy about the expansion of nato and its movement toward our borders
5065484 to act in a 21st century way to fully integrate into the international institutions
5065485 russia is considering arming its baltic fleet with nuclear warheads for the first time since the cold war
5065486 according to the report under the russian plans nuclear warheads could be supplied to submarines cruisers and fighter bombers of the baltic fleet based in kaliningrad a russian enclave between poland and lithuania
5065487 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
5065488 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
5065489 the sense of alarm may be greatest here in ukraine
5065490 since the orange revolution began in 2004 bringing the pro western viktor yushchenko to power after widespread protests ukraine has been a thorn in moscows side though perhaps not as sharp as the outspoken georgian president mikheil saakashvili
5065491 seen from moscow eyes the attempt of nato to take ukraine or kievan rus the historic heart of slavic russia for almost one thousand years along with russia and belarus was not only militarily a grave threat it was also culturally and economically potentially catastrophic given the distribution of industry and infrastructure between ukraine and russia dating back to the 1930s
5065492 however the proverbial straw that broke the russian camels back was the decision by washington to pursue nuclear missile defense installations in nato members poland and the czech republic
5065493 russia must adequately react to the agreement signed between washington and warsaw on us missile defense shield in polands territory
5065494 using lead scoring to identify high potential opportunities for sales
5065495 specific b2b marketing initiatives to use during a challenging economy
5065496 withdrawal without delay of all the that entered georgia since aug 7
5065497 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5065498 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5065499 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbor was a brutal and excessive response
5065500 i was speechless yesterday for a while today i cried
5065501 little jamaica our country is blessed with some of the best if not the best talent you can find

5065530 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5065531 it was approximately three kilometres from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft
5065532 yet again the russian president has given his word and i hope this time he will honor it
5065533 any notion that russia was the kind of responsible state that is ready to integrate into international institutions of the political diplomatic security economic kind this forward leaning modern russia that reputation is frankly in tatters
5065534 we clearly have seen a side of russia that we had hoped was a thing of the past and we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward
5065535 and that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5065536 you cant restrict people from going in there but its irresponsible if there are warnings out there especially given the recent weather
5065537 its not only putting yourself at risk its the rescue people involved who are also put at risk
5065538 i bet he hasnt got a smile on his face like that any more
5065539 its almost like weve got two things to worry about the media trial and the police they actually impact on each other hugely which is scary and its not fair on tony
5065540 theres pressure on the hospital but we are managing the best we can
5065541 we will remove the restrictions as soon as the situation is under control
5065542 for too long cleaning has been viewed as a cost to be minimised and a substantial investment in the cleaning sector is urgently needed
5065543 is he trying to determine if im a u s citizen
5065544 we have deployed a search squad and security has been tightened in the vicinity and in kathmandu
5065545 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5065546 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block
5065547 while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on the 29th of march 2008
5065548 it wont last unless its a common product that is owned by this entire collective of the leadership of zimbabwe
5065549 an isaf unit on a mission to deny an insurgent safe haven has accidentally killed four civilians and wounded three others who were located inside a compound
5065550 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5065551 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5065552 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they militants would have known women and children were present
5065553 we have succeeded in upgrading the capabilities of our planes and have increased the range of these planes to 3 000km without refuelling
5065554 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5065555 i think there are a lot more people who have done a lot more good than i have
5065556 his volunteerism is the single greatest force that has caused the growth and the success of first step and the number of children served through the state in 26 counties
5065557 i think without him that would not have been possible
5065558 when i go in there with a new box of caps and give them all a new baseball cap you just see their faces light up
5065559 hes not looking for anything he does it without being seen
5065560 i just do it because i like to do it and i like to help others
5065561 the object of the project is to build self esteem in the girls for these new babies theyre raising
5065562 we talked about what our parents did that we didnt like and what we want to do with our babies

5065564 we have six percent recall and we are too lazy to test ourselves

5065575 its better for everyone if they forget we ever met
5065576 oh good youre just in time for dinner im glad i made extra
5065577 harry youve got to do something about that wand who knows how many nutters there are out there looking for the chance to do you in
5065578 well i cant exactly post an advert in the prophet telling would be assassins that im putting the wand in dumbledores tomb so you might as well bugger off
5065579 i dont know whats got into you lot but if you cant do me the favour of being good company at the table you can very well clean it off
5065580 when is it going to end harry when are you going to have peace in your life
5065581 what if we pull another polyjuice harry operation to put them off the trail
5065582 you need to head out of the country for a while maybe a year or so while youre gone just for the first month or two mind you we pose as you and are seen around britain that way no one knows youve left but us and we get some time to work out how to thrown them off the scent
5065583 theres only one way im going to go along with this
5065584 harry and i are going to have a gap year
5065585 its when you take a year off before you decide what job to take were going to canada
5065586 yes we are you wanted to see where your family is buried and im coming with you to keep you company
5065587 its highly improper for a young witch and wizard to go gallivanting across the world together
5065588 we wont be gallivanting or anything like that were just taking a break together
5065589 havent we raised you better than that and what about your education arent you going to finish hogwarts
5065590 harrys not going back and i dont think i will either we already have four n e w t s
5065591 i could support the idea if you were chaperoned or
5065592 if you were married of course i couldnt say anything about it if you were married
5065593 i know we havent exactly talked about this and i havent really even thought about this but sometimes you just have to do something and this is what i want to do
5065594 i want you to come with me ginny and theres never going to be any one else so we might as well
5065595 ive got a question for you would you mind stepping outside for a minute
5065596 id like to think of you as a son if youd allow me the privilege youve certainly earned a place in the hearts of my family
5065597 oh i daresay you can think of something happier than an old wizard like me
5065598 i want to marry ginny arthur and id like to have your approval
5065599 do you feel the two of you are old enough to be making this decision have you had enough time together
5065600 i dont know if theres a certain age where the world starts making sense but im starting to realise that ginny isnt going to have anyone else very easily shes determined and patient and wonderful
5065601 now have you given any thought to where you are going to live do you have somewhere picked out have you talked about finances together you should have a budget and stick to it regardless of your income are you prepared to think about having kids take it from me family planning is extremely important to iron out before marriage
5065602 well i daresay therell be time to consider such things you have all the time in the world
5065603 itll always be ginny for me im going to marry her

5065610 maybe its for the best you asked now mum probably thinks im a scarlet woman as it is what with you dean and michael in the space of two years
5065611 oh harry you do know how to make a witch happy

5065616 if she says yes but were probably going to get married soon so we can get off to canada
5065617 a bit of advice you might want to talk about marriage with her before you propose you know ask her what she thinks of the idea just get her talking you know how she is
5065618 well just have family but youd better get those invitations out if the wedding will be in two weeks
5065619 you know therell be all kinds of suspicion with a rushed wedding like this witch weekly will have their tongues wagging about you getting pregnant or something
5065620 no mum im not pregnant harry and i havent even talked about
5065621 weve been engaged for a whole ten hours its not like weve been putting it off
5065622 well all have to get fitted for robes of course
5065623 cant we just use the ones from bill and fleurs wedding
5065624 i envisioned a more green and gold motif for your wedding and besides you cant wear a bridesmaid dress to your own wedding
5065625 im pure and virginal i havent been shagging every boy thats come my way why cant you believe that i saved myself for harry
5065626 its my fault and ill be the one to mend it
5065627 youll find that your life will revolve more and more around her and less and less around yourself ah the post
5065628 i dont want to get another set of robes cant we just
5065629 now get off your backside and get to diagon alley
5065630 thank you for attending this momentous event today marks the first of many measures which will grant our world greater security and peace by sealing the doors to the muggle world permanently not only will we prevent further contamination of our culture and heritage from their divisive influence but we will preserve a tradition steeped in a greater understanding of life and prosperity
5065631 hes using the war to advance his short sighted narrow minded backwards view that magical people are somehow better than muggles because of their magic
5065632 right now i want to think about ginnys wedding dress
5065633 i just want to go home and be with harry
5065634 youve only been gone from him for a couple of hours
5065635 why in the world would you be jealous of me
5065636 im pale spotted and plain youve no reason to be jealous of that
5065637 rons thick and stupid in the head when it comes to love that you know but hes also very much in love with you
5065638 yes hermione he does love you you just have to be patient

5065642 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5065643 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision

5065650 there is no such notion anymore in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5065651 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5065652 russia overreached used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price
5065653 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5065654 serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union

5065658 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5065659 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
5065660 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5065661 there are ups and downs with a slight advantage to obama
5065662 if anybody had asked us a couple of months ago whether or not we would like to be where we are today which from what we can tell is a pretty even race we would have been pretty thrilled
5065663 obama cannot announce during the denver convention and it makes no sense in terms of the news cycle to announce during a weekend
5065664 so i would be very surprised if he left it later than thursday
5065665 fires in the borjomi forests are still continuing there was unfortunately no progress in the fight against the fires
5065666 nothing to do with the forest fire in borjomi if the georgians come to us we are ready to help them extinguish it
5065667 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5065668 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
5065669 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5065670 there are ups and downs with a slight advantage to obama
5065671 if anybody had asked us a couple of months ago whether or not we would like to be where we are today which from what we can tell is a pretty even race we would have been pretty thrilled
5065672 i walked in there and i fell it was dark and i didnt know when i was going to stop

5065676 right now the country is rich and people are strong and we chinese are really standing up twenty years ago no matter where we chinese stood people looked down on us but now no one dares to invade us anymore
5065677 i have to compliment the team for a fantastic time over the last 45 days
5065678 we have had a lot of fun and enjoyed it but we were very ambitious and dealt with people with respect in and out of the team of course the players are disappointed now but reaching the final is something special
5065679 i wouldnt like to comment on individual performances but it was good to have him there he was a leader for our team he represents the team and germany very well
5065680 it was most likely my last euro these are my thoughts what could we have done better bad displays were followed by good ones but unfortunately we could not keep that rhythm going into the final

5065683 is mahatma the ghandi of the musical world and here is the sigmund freud
5065684 back then we played with all sorts of different people
5065685 so we basically have to shape our repertoire around the abilities and interests of the musicians as opposed to the luxury of having a musical vision and then finding the right people for the job
5065686 club owners will not risk guaranteeing paying anyone if not enough people show up the musicians get screwed over this has happened to me time and time again
5065687 the problem with playing at new places is that you have to fight for basic rights such as a decent fee that does not depend on whether you can bring a crowd

5065693 when he started he said he would turn the economy around within a short time of six months now 20 months on the economy has shown very little sign of progress
5065694 ah you know hes got a lot longer track record than that
5065695 hes been doing ah hes a legendary entrepreneur and you know one of the things that i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy
5065696 i particularly hope he obama strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5065697 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5065698 pickens should support obama why what energy plan had obama put forth to deserve anyones confidence the day obama runs on anything other than a liberal cnn talking point i might consider not changing the station when he comes on is it his one term in congress that makes him so qualified or is it his lack of overseas diplomacy or could it be his complete lack of understanding of conflict and how to deal with the enemy does everyone get a pony if this guy wins what the heck am i missing

5065727 because of the overwhelming size of the collection we decided the best and expeditious course of action was to publicize the art work to the general public
5065728 the way i look at it if you get something from a doctor you dont like you find a doctor that gives you better options i found another doctor who said id live seven to 20 years so i like that doctor better
5065729 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity
5065730 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive
5065731 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life
5065732 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
5065733 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line
5065734 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
5065735 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
5065736 its important for our family as much as it is for the team
5065737 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going
5065738 im just a dad whos kind of sick whos looking forward to watching his son play
5065739 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5065740 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5065741 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5065742 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
5065743 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
5065744 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5065745 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
5065746 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
5065747 too many people grow up thats the real trouble with the world too many people grow up
5065748 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5065749 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5065750 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5065751 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5065752 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5065753 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5065754 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5065755 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5065756 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5065757 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5065758 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5065759 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5065760 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5065761 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5065762 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5065763 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5065764 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5065765 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5065766 youre talking about a guy whos a surefire hall of famer in his sport
5065767 theres been a lot of great players but hes the only one of the real superstars that has played with an organization at that kind level and for that long
5065768 you have to win a championship to be even considered
5065769 for someone like me who likes both sports baseball and basketball its pretty difficult to pick one thats actually better
5065770 theyre pretty equal to be honest with you with what theyve done

5065782 my oldest daughter once said dad how come you dont hang around with women your own age and i said listen women my age are usually a lot older than me part of the secret to staying young is dont hang around with people your own age because youll get old with them hang out with the young people and youll stay young i discovered that life begins at 60 the reason is by the time you get to be 60 you just dont care what happens youve done it all and you suddenly feel free about everything
5065783 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
5065784 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
5065785 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5065786 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5065787 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5065788 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5065789 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5065790 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5065791 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5065792 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
5065793 hi my name is kristen thats my mom right there
5065794 that was some fire and brimstone hissed golda derisively as the opposition leader walked by
5065795 so how does that square with rogers cease fire initiative which is tantamount to appeasing the russians and the arabs
5065796 because all along nixon and kissinger have known that in the war of attrition the soviets and the egyptians were putting us both america and israel to a test they know the soviets are feeding and manipulating the entire egyptian war effort thats why i was the one to advocate deep penetration raids into the heart of egyptian territory to prove to the americans that we have what it takes to stand up to the soviets those raids not only changed the balance of power along the fighting front they tipped the scales of the superpower confrontation in americas favor and thanks to that it ensures our american arms supplies but nixon nevertheless has to strike a balance
5065797 if it were just a question of israel against the egyptians and the syrians id say
5065798 damn the oil america can get it from other sources we have to stand by decent nations in the middle east we will back you militarily but the military escalation cant go on endlessly we must do something politically and that
5065799 i personally dont think any american president has ever uttered such a pro israel statement before add to that in return for our accepting the rogers cease fire package nixon has promised me we will not be expected to withdraw a single soldier from the cease fire lines except in the context of a contractual peace agreement which we would regard satisfactory to our security needs moreover had we not accepted the rogers initiative we would not be getting any more american arms surely you understand that

5065805 as i have been writing for iwpr my articles could have upset the warlords and they might have taken this step to choke us
5065806 i have been writing about warlords and their criminal activities in the north of afghanistan as they did not find any proof they could not threaten me but they wanted to take it out on my brother
5065807 i dont know who could be behind this kambakhsh told eurasianet from prison through his brother in response to questions
5065808 as i have not committed any crimes i am very hopeful to be exonerated from the next court freedom of media is very important in a society and it actually reflects the peoples voice
5065809 strongly criticises those domestic and international organisations which are pressurising afghanistans government and legal authorities when pursuing such people
5065810 if it is illegal to read and write something then this is not a democracy its a dictatorship
5065811 the shows are not all that raunchy but they critics are not happy with the way they portray strong women
5065812 as afghanistan gears up for presidential and parliamentary elections it is more important than ever to promote a professional media industry free from the threat of reprisal and content restrictions on religious or any other grounds
5065813 since my brothers detention i have not written any articles
5065814 it will of course scare the other journalists now many journalists are awaiting the next verdict many do not dare to report controversial stuff trackback

5065836 rep ayala made a great case on behalf of aspira and why their good work deserves this commitment from the state to help fund some of their programming

5065853 people are talking about runs they havent seen for a decade or more
5065854 what were seeing this year is an increase in marine survival we dont know why theres a whole new international research program gearing up to try and find answers about whats happening to the fish in the ocean but whatever has changed the grilse are back this year the numbers of salmon are consistent with other years and what we should see is a big increase in large salmon next year
5065855 theres usually a good relationship between grilse returns one year and salmon returns the following year
5065856 this year salmon runs are average but if grilse have good survival we hope that salmon will also have good survival and wed see more of those next year
5065857 where the freshwater habitat is good and where the stocks have been holding their own they seem to be able to rebound when conditions are good but there are still some pretty desperate situations in the southern areas of distribution
5065858 the fact is that russia has broken all its promises for the last several days
5065859 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5065860 i think that one of the consequences of what russia has done frankly is to make all of their neighbors very apprehensive
5065861 those in the near abroad those in eastern europe and others who had experience with the soviet union in the bad old days theyve seen some familiar behavior here and they dont like it
5065862 yet again the russian president has given his word this time i hope hell honor it

5065867 there was no comfort here the air conditioner spit musty air the pine green flocked walls and furniture made to look like dark wood the ineffective television set the leprous mirror the trickle of eggy water from the crusted shower spout the scrapey bedclothes the too thick curtains the room clung around dampish and dark
5065868 todays subforties have very different horrors prominent among which are anomie and solipsism and a peculiarly american loneliness the prospect of having died without once having loved something more than yourself
5065869 give as much of yourself as you understand to as much of jesus as you understand
5065870 by believing that god sent his son jesus christ to die on the cross for my sins
5065871 what what did he just say i cant understand him
5065872 it means that those sins that i have on a fairly regular basis hopefully will be washed away
5065873 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5065874 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one but point number two i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and come to that conclusion not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually they wrestle with these things in profound ways in consultation with their pastors or spouses or their doctors and their family members and so for me the goal right now should be and this is where i think we can find common ground and by the way i have now inserted this into the democrat party platform is how do we reduce the number of abortions because the fact is that although weve had a president who is opposed to abortions over the last eight years abortions have not gone down
5065875 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies thats my commitment thats my commitment to you
5065876 you know i remember what my mother used to tell me i was talking to somebody a while back and i said the one time that shed get really angry with me is if she ever thought that i was being mean to somebody or unfair to somebody she said imagine standing in their shoes imagine looking through their eyes that basic idea of empathy and that i think is whats made america special is that notion that everybodys got a shot if we see somebody down and out if we see a kid whos who cant afford college that we care for them too and i want to be president because thats the america i believe in and i feel like that american dream is slipping away i think we are at a critical juncture economically i think we are at a critical juncture internationally weve got to make some big decisions not just for us but for the next generation and we keep on putting it off and unfortunately our politics is so broken and washington is so broken that we cant seem to bring together people of goodwill to solve these common problems i think i have the ability to build bridges across partisan lines racial regional lines to get people to work on some common sense solution to critical issues and i hope that i have the opportunity
5065877 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than their self interest i believe that americas best days are ahead of us but i also believe that we face enormous challenges both national security and domestic as we have found out in the last few days in the case of georgia and i want to be make sure that everybody understands that this is a time for us to come together throughout my life from the time i was 17 and raised my hand and was sworn in as a midshipman at the united states naval academy ive always put my country first i put my country first when i had the honor of serving in the military and i had the honor of putting my country first as a member of the house of representatives and in the united states senate america wants hope america wants optimism america wants us to sit down together i have a record of reaching across the aisle and working with the other party and i want to do that and i believe as i said that americans feel its time for us to put our country first and we may disagree on a specific issue and i wont review them now but i want every american to know that when i go to gees bend alabama and meet the african american woman there who are so wonderful and lovely an experience ill never forget and i go to places where i know they probably wont vote for me i know that my job is to tell them that ill be the president of every american and ill always put my country first
5065878 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5065879 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
5065880 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5065881 there are ups and downs with a slight advantage to obama
5065882 fires in the borjomi forests are still continuing there was unfortunately no progress in the fight against the fires
5065883 we have succeeded in upgrading the capabilities of our planes and have increased the range of these planes to 3000km without refuelling
5065884 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5065885 i think part of the problem in terms of canadians perception of stephane dion has been these attack ads by the conservative government perhaps they have had somewhat of an impact
5065886 the polls seem to indicate a neck and neck race and i think the campaign is going to make a difference i dont think for a second that people have given up on stephane dion
5065887 i do think its fair to say that in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well anymore its becoming increasingly dysfunctional
5065888 i dont think voters appreciate bairds abrasive style his caustic approach to politics i think they see him as almost a hyper partisan someone who puts partisanship ahead of good government
5065889 theres a sense that certainly elements of youth crime arent being dealt with properly that there arent the proper sanctions
5065890 were not looking at this in a punitive way if people are going to be in jail for a number of years lets get them into a training program an apprentice program
5065891 were staying on our economic plan looking for solid economic fundamentals solid growth for the canadian economy none of the bubbles that weve seen in the u s particularly in the housing sector
5065892 the first one tipped one tipped and the other one was right behind its amazing how the girl went straight down
5065893 the fungal bracket is fan shaped and appears annually during the summer
5065894 as it is show week over here needless to say the weather has broken down but going by the weather forecast tonight we may be lucky and have a better day on thursday fingers crossed

5065897 people still dont know about our work at hemal kasa
5065898 it had to be an open hospital because the tribals were not comfortable inside buildings we had to do all our examinations and even surgeries out in the open recalls prakash as he cleans up a gangrene ridden leg
5065899 the only time before marriage i had been in a forest area was on a picnic the next time it became home today i dont think i can separate my personal and work life with prakash
5065900 we have tremendous respect for manda vahini because she was the only woman in the camp at the time
5065901 we started with the idea of providing medicines but soon realised it was not enough they had no access to education and hence social change explains prakash
5065902 the locals must have convinced the naxals not to hurt us
5065903 i already own three and now im here to buy for my japanese friend
5065904 this mix of eastern and western content and execution is really neat i hope they dont mix the big flaws of each though the annoying western tendency to do quick and silly happy ends and the complete inability of the east to do a proper ending at all
5065905 before you go you mind digging up my evil plan
5065906 the worst youve got to fear is your evil plan exploding
5065907 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim
5065908 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5065909 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5065910 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5065911 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5065912 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5065913 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5065914 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5065915 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5065916 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5065917 i dont want to hear his rev wright explanation i dont know if anyone wants them there are no explanations
5065918 america has been the best country on earth for black folks it was here that 600 000 black people brought from africa in slave ships grew into a community of 40 million were introduced to christian salvation and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known
5065919 and besides all that what we need is a decentralized distributed system of depositing electronic files to local libraries willing to host them
5065920 that overhand right that shocked the hell out of me
5065921 i didnt see it coming and i got caught with it that definitely had an effect on the outcome of the fight
5065922 i wasnt able to see right at the beginning of the fight youre blind how much does that affect you i dont know its not good
5065923 but i think were going to be ok were still seeing with the doctors what the final results going to be on that
5065924 thats the worst part about the fight i felt in great shape
5065925 you get caught early on and theres nothing you can do about it you make do with the cards youre dealt sometimes we got dealt some pretty bad ones early on we tried to stay in the fight and do what we could do
5065926 what do you expect thats kind of his shtick its what he does i figure thats what everybody expected from him
5065927 i didnt really have any words with him before the bout ive never even really met the guy
5065928 ive been around this sport for years ive never really done any trash talking or anything like that before a match i dont know where that came from
5065929 i never even had a discussion with the ufc about anything
5065930 ill be honest you bringing that up is the first ive heard of it
5065931 ive got some other stuff kind of working on the backburner right now were going to go do some of that stuff and just see how everything pans out
5065932 ive got some acting possibilities im going to try to do some acting a little bit
5065933 im trying to get back to training and do some other things with training
5065934 its just disappointing when you kind of feel like youve done everything right and you get some bad luck early on ive got to clean that out a little bit and get refocused well be back to business before too long i imagine
5065935 we took the best lesnar could give us for 15 minutes and he couldnt finish it
5065936 i dont know what else hes going to bring to the table to finish me off
5065937 we took his best shot and went on from there id love for him to take one of mine and well see how it goes
5065938 damn woman what do you want catch it get it dont kill it which is it catch it or dont kill it because i cant do both
5065939 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5065940 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge
5065941 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them
5065942 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5065943 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision
5065944 in an irony sure to set blogger hearts beating giddily the film graces the cover of ews new fall preview issue
5065945 ew and warner bros share a parent company but they clearly do not share you know important information
5065946 and i would say i hope it is sensational when we work a story well probably take the most sensational angle and put it in the headline and blast it to catch your attention
5065947 a big news event with accompanying photograph a major celebrity doing something that they said they werent doing
5065948 because she went on a diet talked about the diet recently and these pics indicate it was not too successful
5065949 his face looks sunken now where it did not before
5065950 the first time we named rielle hunter as lover and revealed she was 6 months pregnant and got the exclusive photo of her
5065951 ok so its 2 40 in the morning and theres a basement lobby i approached him and i said mr edwards alexander hitchen from the national enquirer would you like to explain why you were with your mistress rielle hunter and your love child tonight
5065952 at that point he went white and ran into a restroom i tried to open the door and hes pushing and pulling
5065953 that is the sixty four thousand million dollar question isnt it
5065954 the national enquirer gives the story cooties for all the times and boston globes the washington posts of the world that is partly because thirty years forty fifty years ago the national enquirer was very different than today it is this low brow celebrity scandal mongering thing
5065955 but you know we do pretty well thats not to say we get everything right we dont but you show the newspaper that does ill start subscribing to it right now
5065956 it left the bloody footprints at the murder scene he said he never owned those ugly ass shoes that was his famous quote and nobody could find a photograph of him wearing them we found the photograph
5065957 i think this john edwards case will be a moment well look back in three five ten years hence and say that was one of the moments when the main street media realized that they cant make assumptions about the truth of a story based on where it popped up
5065958 i think well send a reporter or two over there and nose around and see what we find out
5065959 stop stop i dont want to go there i do not like it
5065960 and theres some places i dont want to go and in this case we really have tried to stay away from that aspect of the story
5065961 i want to hit the news element of the story i want to hit the fact that a man running for president had an affair and then lied about it to the american public and you know darn near blew up his own political party while doing it
5065962 you hardly need to know any history to pass the history exam
5065963 watering down the regents has really done damage to the kids
5065964 youre not testing to distinguish the genius from the nongenius

5065979 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5065980 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5065981 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5065982 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5065983 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5065984 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5065985 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5065986 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5065987 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5065988 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5065989 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5065990 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5065991 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person
5065992 this is clearly an intentional opportunity to lead somebody astray
5065993 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5065994 we will also investigate internally how this incident took place and who was involved and make whatever decisions are necessary to ensure that this kind of situation never happens again
5065995 the expectations we set for everyone at joe gibbs racing begins with me and i personally apologize to nascar our partners and our fans for the negative light this situation has cast upon all of us
5065996 the blame starts with ownership and falls on our shoulders
5065997 when youve got management in place and crew chiefs in place i think everyone has a level of responsibility and it starts with us thats the frustrating part of it they know how we operate and this isnt it
5065998 the crew chief yeah they are responsible for what happens with that car on the track and if something happens that they dont know about they should know about it
5065999 no matter what nascar does were going to address this issue in house figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5066000 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint wanting to show that we have less horsepower than we had before and wanted it to look like were handicapped more than we actually were
5066001 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners and to toyota
5066002 a couple of guys chose to make a decision here that really impacts all of us to me the frustrating part is why for us in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you
5066003 for us to get 1 2 3 jamaicas saying something stewart said
5066004 they are its safe to assume shes referring to the americans three of whom qualified for the womens 100 final but left the track in frustration and disgrace

5066013 racist treatment and brutal human rights abuses of migrants and refugees
5066014 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5066015 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5066016 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about

5066033 every morning people wake up looking through the window and they notice that there is something different out there no matter its tangible or intangible
5066034 were the witnesses of these rapid changes in the urban landscape of the city as the charming lifestyle of macau has been replaced by a busy one
5066035 i cant criticise too much about the city as im not a local thats why i designed my wall relief according to local places or scenes that attracted me the most
5066036 i like wandering around in old districts such as taipas old town and the inner harbour areas to see the houses windows and tiles on the grounds
5066037 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5066038 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5066039 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5066040 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5066041 i do not know where my children are and you can imagine how i feel about it
5066042 we are deploying innovative and modern construction technology for faster and cost efficient construction
5066043 execution would be the key to success and the flats would be cheaper by more than 50 per cent of the existing prices
5066044 most large developers have now woken up to the fact that affordable housing projects have the fastest absorption rates and are focusing on this
5066045 however we are staying put with our existing stores in the us and western europe where recession has already set in
5066046 there are already some autoshows organised by local organisations but they are not as well managed the intention is to bridge this discrepancy
5066047 chemolutions would help us move up the value chain our expertise is to provide clients with certain products this is the natural way forward as the chinese are getting better at supplying api in large volumes

5066052 by not filing a flight plan nobody knows what path you chose to take with that airplane and its occupants
5066053 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5066054 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5066055 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5066056 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5066057 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5066058 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5066059 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5066060 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee
5066061 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5066062 i carried ten wounded people to the hospital in my car
5066063 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge
5066064 people used to be taught sequentially that notion has shifted because of things like the internet where you really dont need to know prerequisite information to search out whats useful for you that makes it difficult for some museums that rely on things like chronology the challenge for institutions is to find ways to have different points of contact for the visitor
5066065 the shift was that it was not so much about understanding the airplane but the human achievement of lindbergh sitting in that cramped cockpit for 23 hours
5066066 you have to read a lot on the boards and the kids get bored this is an excellent way to keep them occupied and then they will want to come back
5066067 the february break was one of the best weeks weve ever had
5066068 in talking to many of the families that were here many said they normally go away they go skiing or to florida but not this year so they came to the museum the flip side is that were very concerned about our endowment and the rising costs of fuel and electricity is impacting our budget tremendously
5066069 museums do well in a slow economy because they are a form of family entertainment that is relatively affordable
5066070 the average admission cost at a museum is six dollars and many museums are free
5066071 we expect to see less giving this year because of tighter budgets
5066072 we cut budgets that we had raised at the end of last year after everything started to fall apart
5066073 its difficult to find stuff that will both serve your mission and be alluring to people
5066074 kids today are so steeped in things that are interactive and electronic so museums are looking a lot more at how they can be more hands on
5066075 so every weekend there were things for families to do when they get here whether they are crafts or guided tours and building events around milestones
5066076 it was mainly his physical talent and real competitiveness that stood out
5066077 a number of things make him the swimmer he is but i think it is largely psychological he can relax and focus on what he is doing when under pressure and actually this sort of environment makes him perform better

5066085 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
5066086 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
5066087 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
5066088 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
5066089 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
5066090 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
5066091 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff

5066097 why do you say that they have done good service to your country in terms of health and so forth i dont understand
5066098 i said damn the english because they think they are better than i am
5066099 to be an afro american or an american black is to be in the situation intolerably exaggerated of all those who have ever found themselves part of a civilization which they could in no wise honorably defend which they were compelled indeed endlessly to attack and condemn and who yet spoke out of the most passionate love hoping to make the kingdom new to make it honorable and worthy of life
5066100 the disinherited man has a sense of gross injury he finds it well nigh impossible to forgive because his injury is often gratuitous it is not for something that he has done an action resulting from a deliberate violation of another he is penalized for what he is in the eyes and the standards of another somehow he must free himself of the will to retaliation that keeps alive his hatred
5066101 let justice roll on like a river righteousness like a never failing stream amos 5 24
5066102 barack says we need to have a conversation about race in america fair enough but this time it has to be a two way conversation white america needs to be heard from not just lectured to this time the silent majority needs to have its convictions grievances and demands heard and among them are these first america has been the best country on earth for black folks it was here that 600 000 black people brought from africa in slave ships grew into a community of 40 million were introduced to christian salvation and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known
5066103 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
5066104 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5066105 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5066106 we will also have to determine if russias intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response

5066113 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5066114 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5066115 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
5066116 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage

5066126 for folks that havent gone the converter box route we encourage them to request coupons now and when they come in three weeks redeem them immediately to make sure the coupon doesnt expire

5066206 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5066209 i highly recommend lectio divina a way of being with god and life while many books laud the value of integrating lectio into our lives and some may provide the briefest of explanations this is the only source that i am aware of that provides both the tradition and development of lectio divina along with contemporary expressions of lectio in practice this book has grown out of years of practice and in mentoring others to cultivate ways of lectio divina that deepen the contemplative stance toward life lectio has been the heart and gut of monastic practice for centuries the spirit invites all of gods people to partake of this ancient way with god
5066210 lectio divina a way of being with god and life is above all a practical book it is rooted in the authors own practice and the experience of those for whom they provide spiritual direction it gives practical advice for readers who wish to deepen their life with god on the basis prayerful reading of the bible or the other ways in which gods word reaches us those who listen with their hearts to these authors words will be deepened in their spiritual practice
5066211 with the rising interest in the art of lectio divina christine valters paintner and lucy wynkoop have created a work of great promise in this superb resource the ancient wisdom and the poetry of the lectio process shines forth this is a praiseworthy offering
5066212 christine valters paintner and lucy wynkoop offer a way of practicing lectio divina that is inviting accessible and practical their deep confidence in this way of prayer and the clarity and wisdom with which they beckon the reader spring from their own lived experience with its singular combination of insights for daily life and prayer and suggestions for practice this book will prove helpful to both the novice and to those who teach this way of prayer
5066213 wynkoop and paintners lectio divina is a lovely book with a gentle lyrical style that reveals lectios aim in the authors tone as well as words in their hands lectio takes shape as a transforming power combining the great aspiration to love and be loved by god with full acceptance of ourselves as we are i especially enjoy the way wynkoop and paintner integrate the prayer of lectio with the senses describing its wisdom as basking and luxuriating in gods presence and offering specific suggestions for integrating art poetry images music and the body into a lectio practice lectio divina is an act of consecration the lifting up of our lives and souls to god
5066214 if a college student practicing a secular adaptation of lectio divina hears the

5066236 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
5066237 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
5066238 the cost of having an army contingent provide the same services as blackwater appears to be roughly the same as the cost of the contract itself
5066239 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5066240 our enemies who had once dropped bombs on us were now bringing us food and coal to heat our homes with

5066262 i walked in there and i fell it was dark and i didnt know when i was going to stop
5066263 i dont happen to agree with everything either of the candidates teach or believe but they both care deeply about america theyre both patriots and they have very different views on how our nation can be strengthened weve got to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and we need to restore civility in our civil discourse and thats the goal of the saddleback civil forum
5066264 obama gave a very long answer to the question and did so by not saying anything hes also got the abortion numbers wrong within that as well as using old numbers you know that hillary clinton had debunked a year ago
5066265 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
5066266 i am pro choice because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually rather they wrestle with these things in profound ways
5066267 at the moment of conception i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5066268 john mccain without hesitation bang life begins at conception he gets it the judges that he would appoint he made it very very clear i think he also resonated with beyond the base to those who are pro life even within the democratic party i think it was exactly what needed to be done he said it exactly the way it needed to be said
5066269 senator mccain helped himself he just will not shake loose of his beliefs that hes held for a long time on favoring research on embryonic stem cells but as soon as tonight he hastened to the safer ground of the promise of adult stem cells as producing progress and disease research so he knows that hes on thin ice with that but on the larger pro life issue hes certainly presented himself quite properly as strongly pro life so that was a good step for him
5066270 i think that senator mccain closed the deal i think he made a clear contract between himself and barack obama many evangelicals will vote for him
5066271 i think the distinction that we heard tonight was clear was decisive was effective that would be muddied if he mixes the ticket in some way and gets somebody who could become the president in the event that something terrible would happen to mccain who would go contrary to the clarity the focus and the energy with which mccain came forth tonight
5066272 obama says he supports marriage between a man and a woman but of course he says he opposed the marriage amendment in california do you see some conflict there
5066273 you cannot square the circle as he is trying to do either you support marriage or you do not he says one thing by his actions he indicates another thing and that answer shows up the hypocrisy in his position on that issue
5066274 i think it would be more refreshing for him if he would just be honest about it and say he favors gay marriage
5066275 he cannot do that because the american people do not favor gay marriage and so he needs to keep twisting and turning diving on that issue and it is hypocritical
5066276 he said that he would not only support he would support states definitions of marriage the defense in his own state of arizona for example where he has been stalwart leader for marriage as a union between one man and one woman but he also made it very clear heres the distinction what john mccain said tonight is his position that he says that the supreme court of california was wrong
5066277 what barack obama left out tonight is that he actually publicly praised the supreme court of california
5066278 answers were sharp i think he has thought a whole lot more about leadership i was particularly impressed by his answer on people he admired he went right to general petraeus who did one of the most remarkable military campaigns in recent memory and i contrast that to senator obama who when asked who influences him the most he mentioned his wife he mentioned his grandmother those are safe nominations
5066279 he got energy he got obviously many more applauses from the people in the room but i say this with a caveat i think he won if he can continue with the kind of fervor and integration of issues and faith i think that he may be on to a new high in his campaign if he retreats to a place of not wanting to talk anymore about these kinds of things i think it will not help him so tremendous win tonight i think its a new chapter i hope it continues

5066338 an organizational meeting including old cadres representatives of the masses individuals from industry and commerce middle school students teachers and other eyewitnesses who were participating in a conference of the masses
5066339 der spiegel stirs up trouble never takes into account the feelings of others and takes things that originally should have been concealed and announces them publicly to the masses therefore give the oversight of power to der spiegel as it is in exact accordance with the masses expectations
5066340 the reason the der spiegel weekly won such immense fame is the investigative reporting that has pervaded this publication over the decades
5066341 as a news publication with its corresponding influence in germany and even europe and the world what amazed us was its correspondingly low error rate
5066342 in addition to providing full and accurate background data for reports every manuscript that will be published goes through a detailed inspection by a data collection expert to ensure that the report is as accurate as possible
5066343 the coloring is bold and vigorous hard for readers to forget the images have a definite form full of connotation the use of simplicity and complexity the cover design has a feeling of rhythm the closely followed issues and viewpoints could arouse the insensible
5066344 when i was young i thought der spiegel was something good but now i know its just prejudiced anti china garbage
5066345 i never knew of der spiegel but now it often shows up before my eyes i can only say you are well known but only because you are notorious
5066346 the communist party wants to use the handling of the crisis caused by this natural disaster to end the international isolation that followed the 3 14 tibet incident never shooting at random the official chinese media allowed the use of this earthquake and the accustomed use of political slogans to unite the people around the party
5066347 when creditability cannot be ascertained we would rather abandon a piece of news than risk the danger of publishing false news
5066348 curious and diligent with wide interests these are the characteristics of the thousands of chinese in german universities and research institutions maybe they are perfect researchers or maybe they are perfect spies or maybe they are both
5066349 look at how the chinese government suppresses people and betrays the olympics
5066350 upon seeing this issue of der spiegel i suddenly thought back to something written for a blog in 2003 that severely attacked americas time magazine that time time had combined images of the chinese flag and a sars patients lung it was unbearably disgusting
5066351 i have been to china and prices are relatively cheap if you take this into account are the workers salaries still low dont you think these reports are misleading
5066352 however the welfare of chinese workers is clearly not as good as german workers
5066353 these reporters misled german readers in the most typical way they didnt specifically explain certain relative elements they used some simple figures in isolation and they then turned them into absolutes for example they criticized the government on human rights by giving the example that chinas annual number of executions is the most in the world however they didnt mention how many people are in china the total population of china the per capita rate how many criminals america executes or the american per capita rate the reporters didnt mention this kind of content
5066354 when choosing sources these reporters had an obvious attitude of mistrust towards official news however when they werent able to find any conclusive evidence to overturn the chinese governments news they introduced a large element of conjecture
5066355 with the merkel administration changing its policy towards a country as important as china of course it would lead to a series of reactions thus it was necessary to use the media to change the circumstances of public opinion regarding the policy
5066356 with der spiegel reporters having been stationed in china this long in reality they are very familiar with chinas situation if they wrote about china in a practical and realistic way their reports would not be like this after meeting them my feeling is that it is not ignorant people doing ignorant things but is people who understand what is going on intentionally doing ignorant things in order to achieve their objectives

5066358 p3 is very pleased to have been awarded this important contract by the nhs supply chain especially in view of the rapid development to standardize wristbands making patient safety the highest priority
5066359 in the uk pdcs write on wristbands are already being used by more hospitals than any other and around the world their automatic positive patient id systems have been the cornerstone of the most successful patient safety initiatives at hospitals for over 50 years we certainly join the nhs in helping to drive this patient safety initiative to improve patient outcomes and help protect lives
5066360 hospitals prefer the pdc systems for their ability to meet patient safety needs
5066361 they meet the nhssc contract needs for both human readable handwritten and more advanced bar code amp rfid wristbands no other company offers the quality breadth and scope of patient wristband solutions like pdc
5066362 hospitals prefer sentry superband for its versatility and ease of use in providing patient identification
5066363 we saw a really good game today because gladbach also played offensively
5066364 what was important for us was that we had a very good goalkeeper otherwise we would have conceded a goal in the first half
5066365 at 3 0 a game is normally tied up but when your opponent scores a goal it can get a little tight we made it difficult because we lacked a certain bite on our counter attacks
5066366 we are very happy with the win in our first games and also played well in parts but its clear that we are still not 100
5066367 at the end of the day we won the game and that is what is important in the second half we came under pressure but its normal to take your foot off the gas a little when you are leading 3 0
5066368 we had good chances to take the lead in the first half but through individual mistakes we lost the ball unnecessarily and stuttgart punished us

5066487 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
5066488 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
5066489 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
5066490 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
5066491 president medvedev agreed but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks
5066492 assured that georgians will not continue to use military force
5066493 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5066494 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5066495 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5066496 i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not
5066497 however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it

5066538 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5066539 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5066540 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

5066551 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5066552 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5066553 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5066554 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5066555 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5066556 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5066557 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5066558 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5066559 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5066560 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5066561 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5066562 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5066563 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5066564 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5066565 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5066566 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5066567 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5066568 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5066569 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5066570 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5066571 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5066572 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5066573 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5066574 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5066575 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5066576 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5066577 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5066578 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5066579 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5066580 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5066581 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5066582 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5066583 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5066584 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5066585 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar

5066588 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5066589 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias

5066644 it was a very pointed message saying look we know theres a connection not just with haqqani but also with other bad guys and isi and we think you could do more and we want you to do more about it
5066645 the chairman desires to keep these meetings private and therefore it would be inappropriate to discuss any details
5066646 genuine and longstanding concerns about pakistans ties to the haqqani network which of course has links to al qaeda
5066647 with no one really at the steering and the bus lurching from one side to the other
5066648 well you know im more interested in listening than doing a lot of talking
5066649 and i think it is very important to recognize that im going over there as a u s senator we have one president at a time so its the presidents job to deliver those messages
5066650 well im looking forward to seeing what the situation on the ground is
5066651 i want to obviously talk to the commanders and get a sense both in afghanistan and in baghdad of you know what the most ah their biggest concerns are and i want to thank our troops for the heroic work that theyve been doing
5066652 hes going to go to the american people and say i want to be commander in chief
5066653 and yet he has been the chairman of the subcommittee that oversights
5066654 im glad he is going to iraq i am glad he is going to afghanistan its long long overdue if you want to lead this nation
5066655 the trip is not at all a campaign trip a rally of any sort
5066656 a series of substantive meetings with our friends and our allies to talk about the common challenges that we face and the national security dangers for the 21st century
5066657 opium cultivation in afghanistan is no longer associated with poverty quite the opposite
5066658 poverty does not appear to have been the main driving factor in the expansion of opium poppy cultivation in recent years
5066659 i know what you say is right poverty is not the main reason people are growing poppy but this is what the president of afghanistan tells me to tell others
5066660 we have a lot of poor people in the drug trade in the u s a people mixing meth in their trailers in rural areas and people selling crack in the inner cities and we put them in jail
5066661 if there is no poppy there is nothing to traffic
5066662 if we are already bombing taliban positions why wont we spray their fields with a harmless herbicide and cut off their money
5066663 it is obvious that the afghan government is more than kind to poppy growers it opposes the american proposal for political reasons the administration believes that it will lose popularity in the southern provinces where the majority of opium is cultivated theyre afraid of losing votes more than 95 percent of the residents of the poppy growing provinces voted for president karzai
5066664 millions of pounds have been committed in provinces including helmand province for irrigation projects and road building to help farmers get their produce to market but for now this has simply made it easier for them to grow and transport opium deep rooted corruption exists in our state institutions
5066665 we must switch from ground based eradication to aerial spraying

5066673 in presidential elections you have between 4 and 11 percent of each party regularly defecting to the other side think of it the other way that means 90 percent or more of partisans vote for the candidate of their party

5066688 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5066689 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5066690 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5066691 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5066692 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5066693 i do not know where my children are and you can imagine how i feel about it

5066712 she served really well she kept it deep and i was always under pressure my serve wasnt that good and she has one of the best on the tour so there was a huge gap
5066713 i knew i had to do something i just couldnt
5066714 to be honest i expected a much more difficult match
5066715 i felt like i was so well prepared and i was ready to stay on the court for a long time

5066723 die dirk meier show ist nicht meine show es ist die show von dirk meier
5066724 in den zeitungen kann man lesen es sei ihre show sie h tten ihr die form gegeben sie schrieben die gags
5066725 das ist leicht bertrieben wenn ich da jeden abend vor der kamera st nde dann w re es meine show ich stehe aber nicht jeden abend vor der kamera wie sie gerade sehen oder sehen sie mich auf ihrem bildschirm dann rate ich ihnen ihr bier unausgetrunken zu lassen und ins bett zu gehen
5066726 ach kommen sie sie wissen was ich meine sie sind der spiritus rector dieser show oder wie sagt man der gag schreiber der ober gag schreiber sie sagen wos lang geht
5066727 er gibt der show ihren stil er sagt was er will wir machen es er ist der boss er h lt die f den in der hand ich bin die marionette
5066728 heute zum beispiel ich wei nicht ein paar der nummern haben beinahe eine literarische qualit t beinahe es ist nicht wirklich literatur aber es zeigt doch talent einen gewissen sinn f r formulierungen aber dann sind da auch wieder sachen dabei das ist der reine m ll also wirklich da m ssen sie besser aufpassen
5066729 nein ich bin nicht an der falschen adresse gelandet ich will mich auch gar nicht beschweren wir kennen uns
5066730 bedaure aber da m ssen sie sich irren soweit ich wei habe ich nie einen lektor gehabt
5066731 ja das ist der titel einer kurzgeschichte die ich mal geschrieben habe als ich das ist einige jahre her oder spielen sie auf etwas anderes an spiele der macht d rfte sch tzungsweise jedes f nfzehnte produkt unserer sogenannten kultur hei en einschlie lich reizw sche
5066732 nein nein ich meine schon ihre geschichte sie haben sie mir mal zugeschickt dem litteron verlag
5066733 es geht um einen alten schriftsteller oder so alt ist der gar nicht aber er f hlt sich alt sehr alt er ist verbittert niemand f hlt sich lter als der verbitterte er sp rt dass er seine ideale verraten hat was wollte er damals als er anfing zu schreiben viel geld verdienen wars das doch nicht oder da war doch noch etwas anderes er hats vergessen er hat sich korrumpieren lassen er schreibt bestseller thriller in denen die welt gerettet wird war es nicht so
5066734 oder l sst er sogar f r sich schreiben besch ftigt er nicht sogar ghostwriter
5066735 warum erz hlen sie mir das alles meine alten geschichten
5066736 dieser schriftsteller wohnt in einer villa am bodensee er ist mit einer frau zusammen die ein kulturjournal im fernsehen moderiert so eine mediendiva die immerzu fremdgeht und essgest rt ist ich erinnere mich daran dass sie essgest rt ist sie wird immer d nner und er wird immer dicker daran erinnere ich mich er sitzt auf seiner terrasse im sonnenlicht das er nicht sp rt wird dicker und dicker und schreibt seine romane w hrend er dar ber nachdenkt mit wem ihn seine frau jetzt wohl gerade betr gt die gefahr die darin liegt wenn man das gleichgewicht verliert er kann eigentlich nicht mehr er ist innerlich tot er f hlt sich als h tten sie ihn mit beton ausgef llt
5066737 seine frau kommt mit ihrem liebhaber vorbei ein junger schauspieler vom theater seine frau geht ins haus um etwas zu holen das sie f r sp ter f r das fernsehen braucht und der schriftsteller macht smalltalk mit dem schauspieler sie sprechen ber die sch nheit des bodensees seine frau kommt zur ck der schauspieler steht auf sie verabschieden sich von dem schriftsteller der schriftsteller sieht im gesicht des schauspielers dass dieser mitleid mit ihm empfindet
5066738 ja und er sagt sie sollten ihn bitte nicht allzu sehr darum beneiden dass er hier sitzen bleiben und weiterhin die sch nheit des bodensees genie en darf er l chelt dazu
5066739 dann bekommt er einen anruf irgendwelche typen kennt er nicht diese typen sagen sie h tten eine ex von ihm entf hrt seine jugendliebe von der er sich getrennt hat weil sie nicht zu diesem ganzen literaten biz gepasst hat weil sie ein bisschen zu na ja sie war sehr geradeheraus nahm kein blatt vor den mund hielt nichts von diesem ganzen kulturgeschw tz ein m dchen vom lande auf eine art sehr einfach stimmts
5066740 sie wissen das besser als ich aber ich glaube so im gro en und ganzen haben sies ganz gut getroffen ja
5066741 diese leute sagen ihm sie w rden seiner gro en liebe etwas antun wenn er nicht pers nlich vorbeik me um sie abzuholen er soll kommen pers nlich darauf bestehen sie er soll kommen aber er kommt nicht
5066742 nein er k mmert sich nicht drum er denkt diese typen bluffen nur und selbst wenn nicht er legt auf und trinkt noch ein bisschen sekt sp ter geht er zu einem empfang den sein verleger f r ihn gibt und vergisst die ganze sache
5066743 was passiert mit dem m dchen mit der frau meine ich
5066744 sie haben sich f r diese frau nie interessiert stimmts genauso wenig wie der alte schriftsteller mit seinen bestsellern in denen die welt gerettet wird ihm ist diese frau auch schei egal gewesen
5066745 ja das ist das tr be ende diese typen wollen dem schriftsteller einen denkzettel verpassen ihm eine lektion erteilen sie schlitzen der armen frau die kehle durch und lassen sie elend verbluten aber dem alten schriftsteller wird der denkzettel nie zugestellt das ist die pointe die polizei stellt keine verbindung zu ihm her und er fragt nie nach
5066746 das sagten sie bereits sie sehen die dirk meier show
5066747 ich wei manches gef llt ihnen anderes nicht so sie waren bereits so freundlich mir das mitzuteilen
5066748 verzeihen sie eine d formation professionelle manchmal f hre ich sogar ironische selbstgespr che sto e ironisch auf
5066749 nein das war nicht der grund durchaus nicht ich fand sie nicht schlecht sie waren nicht brillant das nicht aber was wir sonst so herausgebracht haben nein das war nicht der grund
5066750 sie hatten talent das war der grund es war nicht zu verkennen dass sie wirkliches talent hatten
5066751 vielen dank sie haben mich also abgelehnt weil ich talent hatte arbeiten alle verlage gem dieser logik und gibt es da nicht diese krise im verlagsgewerbe
5066752 kein grund ironisch zu werden ich zum beispiel habe kein talent keinen funken ich k nnte nie etwas schreiben das w re f r niemanden eine freude aber ich habe einen sehr gut entwickelten sinn f r wirkliche literarische qualit t ich meine f r dinge die wirklich tiefe haben die wirklich etwas bedeuten f r dieses gewisse etwas das dinge leben l sst obwohl sie nur aus papier und druckerschw rze bestehen
5066753 hat nichts mit ihnen zu tun warum sollte es ihnen leid tun wissen sie bei ihnen hat mich etwas genervt ich habe mich ber sie ge rgert ich dachte warum macht der es sich so einfach das ist alles so gef llig
5066754 es war alles man konnte das gut lesen wirklich sie konnten damals schon gut schreiben gut mit w rtern umgehen aber man merkte man sp rte einfach dass es da etwas gab vor dem sie sich dr ckten das sie ihren lesern vorenthielten
5066755 ja wie sie vorhin sagten ihre geschichten waren selbstironische selbstgespr che man merkte dass sie sich selbst aus dem weg gingen dass sie sich nicht gern mit sich selbst in einem raum aufhielten und das lag in ihren texten wenn man sie las es fehlte etwas wenn dieses etwas dabei w re dachte ich dann k nnten diese geschichten brillant sein dann k nnte dieser typ einer der ganz gro en werden
5066756 doch es war dabei das war ja das verr ckte deswegen habe ich mich so ber sie ge rgert es war dabei aber sie haben es herausgestrichen da waren diese leerstellen narben man f hlte dass sie etwas heraus geschnitten hatten das machte die sache so rgerlich wie sie sagen sie gingen nicht aufs ganze man sah wie sie auf die bremse traten sie drosselten sich sowohl in sthetischer als auch in menschlicher hinsicht vor allem aber menschlich sie dr ckten sich sie hatten angst
5066757 sie sch mten sich sie sch mten sich f r sich selbst f r ihre gef hle f r diese spezielle form von menschsein die sie darstellten ich hatte den eindruck sie wollten nicht sie selbst sein sie wollten jemand sein den es schon gab oder jemand der jeder sein konnte jemand den man mit jedem anderen verwechseln konnte nur nichts besonderes niemand der auff llt und zugleich sehnten sie sich so ungeheuer danach endlich einmal jemandem aufzufallen
5066758 das haben sie gesp rt als sie meine geschichten lasen dass ich auffallen wollte
5066759 warum h tten sie mir sonst diese geschichten geschickt man schickt nicht seine geschichten an einen verlag damit der sie bequem entsorgt oder sie durch den rei wolf schickt man m chte ver ffentlicht werden man m chte eine stimme bekommen einen namen ein gesicht man m chte jemand werden
5066760 eine ffentliche person eine private person was spielt das f r eine rolle sie wollten jemand werden
5066761 es ist eine schande sie haben soviel talent georg selbst diese fernsehshow nicht bel diese gags nicht ganz und gar misslungen das meiste was die so zeigen ist ja unertr glich aber diese show ist okay stellenweise ist sie okay ich schau sie ganz gerne
5066762 gut das hatten wir schon h ren sie es wird sp t also was kann ich f r sie tun
5066763 ich dachte wenn der junge kapiert dass es nicht darum geht es geschafft zu haben ein bekannter schriftsteller zu sein und dann zu scheitern oder sich eine kugel in den kopf zu jagen dieser romantische schwachsinn dass es nicht darum geht f r ein bisschen verg nglichen ruhm seine w rde und seinen charakter zu verschachern wenn er begriffen hat dass man das eigentliche nicht auslassen darf dass man sich nicht dr cken darf dann kann er ein gro er werden
5066764 worauf sie hinauswollen aber man sollte das nicht berstrapazieren ich schreibe keine beststeller meine freundin moderiert keine show im fernsehen
5066765 finden sie auch ja sie sind viel zu intelligent um anderer ansicht zu sein
5066766 ach kommen sie sie sind immer noch auf der flucht das ist alles
5066767 das ist nichts was ich ihnen bers telefon beibringen k nnte sie werden sich schon hierher bequemen m ssen zu mir pers nlich
5066768 warum sollte ich zu ihnen kommen wie hei en sie eigentlich sie haben mir nicht mal gesagt wie sie hei en
5066769 sie haben den litteron verlag erw hnt ich kriege ihren namen raus ein ehemaliger lektor der gefeuert wurde warum sagen sie mir nicht einfach wie sie hei en
5066770 das m ssen sie kapieren dann k nnte aus ihnen noch was werden
5066771 vielleicht sollte ihnen das lieber amanda sagen hm was meinen sie sie ist hier m chten sie sie sprechen

5066800 its a fine job youve had here for a long time
5066801 i need some cash could you please lend me a cent
5066802 it s coming soon they are not the only one s sinning and denying god many have gone the way of satan and sinning as to everything under the sun so dont be surprised to see christ coming in the eastern sky anytime
5066803 right you are god created human s and he made the animal s thats not evolution atheist do not know what to believe they just hopped on the big lie and riding the waves to hell
5066804 because they have let satan decieve them just as the bible says they would
5066805 im a christian and i believe in god but obviously they say
5066806 evolution was always nothing more than a theory creationism is proven through fossils and history
5066807 that tattoos was another way satan was trying to insult god by marking his people
5066808 there was no room on the ark for the dinosaurs so they drowned
5066809 it never rained before the flood that is why no one believed noah
5066810 god grew my nail back despite the surgeons education surgical expertise and his protest
5066811 yes god created all animals but he knew that they dinosaurs would hurt people and allowed them to die during the flood
5066812 science has yet to disprove anything that god has said in his word if science says anything different youd best question the scientist that said it gods word is truth scientists lie
5066813 satan caused adam and eve to sin therefore corrupting paradise thus decay began disease is a direct result of that original sin
5066814 no even if you were a human vegetable strapped to your hospital bed for your entire existence you would still have original sin
5066815 this age of the earth thing is pointless our god can create things aged
5066816 as a christian believer i do think the earth is between 6 000 10 000 years old and i also believe that the dinosaurs did exist but at the times of adam and eve to noah and they all died during the great flood of the earth
5066817 nope personaly i dont believe dinosaurs exzisted its just some freaking scientistss business make believe thing read your bible
5066818 yes they dinosaurs were in the garden with adam and eve they are described in job 40
5066819 seashells on mt everest proving the flood is true proving the bible is true proving creation is true proving that you are wrong if you are going to hang your eternal destiny on how old the world looks you are in big trouble me thinks you should investigate a bit more
5066820 for all you people who say it is plate tectonics who do you think controls them duh i agree with the asker and think that california is first in line for a one way ticket to hell
5066821 its obvious and science does nothing but continue to prove the existence of god
5066822 hell no youre going straight to hell be proud of that
5066823 what would you do if you found yourself burning for eternity in a pit of fire and then realize god does exist only it will be to late to save yourself would you regret not saving yourself sooner
5066824 when the rapture happens yall will be talking about this same subject while youre being burned and beaten by satan for eternity while christians will be having the time of the rest of their lives in heaven i guess thats what you hoped for
5066825 it obviously was made for humans more specifically for jesus to live and die on
5066826 if the earth is here by accident or some boom process why is everything on earth to human scale
5066827 can science remove the sin debt from before the eyes of god the blood of jesus did this
5066828 can scientist heal broken bones in 3 minutes can scientist create something out of nothing
5066829 r u guys planning on burning in hell for eternity cuz thats wuts gonna happen
5066830 the evidence for the existence of dinosaurs in the bible is so absolutely phenomenal but the bible says that they were not tame able nice try
5066831 atheist are sad and bitter people most of them have problems from childhood like abuse or neglect just love them and pray that they will turn loose of the hate before its too late
5066832 in answer to your question atheists simply do not want to believe in god
5066833 it means the atheists believe and worship satan they dont believe in god or jesus or even heaven agnostic dont believe in anything they dont know what they believe in
5066834 that just mean you are vulnerable to the tricks of satan
5066835 better to be an idiot in heaven than a genius in hell i always say
5066836 the question is do you support what they do or do you just stand up for them if you support what they do gods punishment for them will be your punishment also not my words but his
5066837 because they like their sins and dont like the thought of being accountable to god
5066838 the new testament is the very words of christ himself
5066839 oh that nice little pregnant girl can murder her baby it doesnt affect me
5066840 true christians know you dont have to believe in satan to follow him
5066841 because atheists like to lie about the bible and christians in order to try to advance the atheist religion
5066842 sin is sin is being bigoted and racist and hateful worse than being homosexual i dont think so
5066843 yes but a lot of science is proven through facts in the bible scientists are just too stupid to admit it amp amp the reason he lets horrible things happen is because were free willed we cause our own wars sounds dumb but makes sense if you actually read the bible
5066844 i think its because the people without god in their lives are under satans control and listen to satans lies we should pray for these lost souls
5066845 because if there is a god and he is the god of scripture then that means they have someone who they are accountable to this is so whether you are an atheists or pantheists while some may say it is not hate as compared to a perfect and holy god it is god says it is hate romans chapter 1 covers this
5066846 the bible says that the cross is an offense to those who are perishing
5066847 the bible tells us we will be persecuted in the name of jesus christ people are afraid and intimidated by his name the bible says every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that jesus is lord bd
5066848 im not going to say i havent second guessed my decision but when i stepped on the field i knew i made the right decision
5066849 its very tough i had some great moments some bad moments too
5066850 the man understands dance i doh let anybody else photograph my shows
5066851 when we first came in here we didnt get along with nobody
5066852 i have to say i wasnt thinking that when the video was on tv more
5066853 got drunk swore broke a tree now ashamed to look people in the face
5066854 das land hat sich von den brutalismen des nationalsozialismus und von der fr mmelnden unnachgiebigen heuchelei der revolution re ob rot ob braun nie erholt

5066859 the one on one counseling will scale because we already have a network of ex ncaa coaches in place across all sports that are recruiting experts and are ready to set up time with athletes
5066860 weve talked to a potential partner at company x and they said they were interested and would be a beta site
5066861 weve held some 3rd party focus groups of our target audience and the feedback was
5066862 our top three nearest competitors are x y and z although all of them are trying to be destination sites and the teams behind them dont have a history in the target market we on the other hand are multimodal being a website mobile application and social web application and weve been living and breathing this space for the past 3 years
5066863 our plan calls for 3mm which gets us from beta product through a 1 0 launch and an early partner business model over the coming 12 months

5066878 weve tried to replace light bulbs we can probably encourage more recyclable materials with our vendors
5066879 because were a fair we like things bright and shiny lights running and colorful
5066880 a lot of them used to just leave them running all night because it looks nice
5066881 the rides that come in when youre talking about the types and sizes of exhibit buildings that we have it is a massive undertaking
5066882 we still had to use regular electricity to work the fans the misters to keep all the animals cool
5066883 its hard to go completely green but thats not to say that little things cant be done here or there
5066884 we found that to work better because the public doesnt necessarily know the different bins
5066885 the most important element is if theyre really taking it seriously or if theyre just paying lip service
5066886 its very tough i had some great moments some bad moments too

5066890 to stand for the line of knights in the image it accompanies assuming the viewer would read the line of soldiers left to right
5066891 the first 20 minutes were really impressive you could see the stuff that we were working on in the preseason developing on the field i thought we hit a little bit of fatigue at the end of the first half a new group in the second half put it back together and we finished the game strong
5066892 she was our leading scorer in the spring she can do a lot of things she can hit the ball with power and head the ball shes a matchup problem for our opponents what a great start for her im really happy for her
5066893 se esta cl usula do acordo de cessar fogo n o for aplicada rapidamente e totalmente teria que ser convocado um conselho europeu extraordin rio para decidir sobre as conseq ncias a serem tomadas

5066895 muito a fazer para estabilizar a situa o de forma duradoura
5066896 tamb m deveremos determinar se a interven o da r ssia contra seu vizinho georgiano foi uma resposta brutal e excessiva neste caso singular ou se inaugura um novo endurecimento de moscou em rela o aos seus vizinhos e toda comunidade internacional o que inevitavelmente teria conseq ncias em sua rela o com a ue
5066897 wir n hern uns der entscheidung den stecker zu ziehen f r das webcasting ist es eine art show down

5066899 what nice fails to mention is that the medicines in question are in common use elsewhere in europe where prices are typically higher than they are here in the uk
5066900 nice has an important job to do but they need to adapt their approach for cancer medicines rather than lay the blame on the process and economics of pharmaceutical innovation
5066901 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
5066902 the share price is very important to a pharmaceutical company pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
5066903 in some parts the water had reached waist level and we wanted to ensure that nobody was stranded in their homes

5066917 dass in der deutschen kultur der tod oft kitsch ist nicht ein einbruch des schicksals von au en unerw nscht und fatal sondern die erf llung der tiefsten sehnsucht der protagonisten und was also anderes als ein happy end nur eben auf deutsch das meinte ich mir w re ein amerikanisches happy end lieber alle umarmen sich und reiten in den sonnenuntergang
5066918 sejak dahulu allah telah ada dan tak ada satu pun bersama nya
5066919 allah memiliki dua malaikat yang dekat kepada nya yang berdoa setiap pagi tuhanku tambahkanlah rahmat kepada orang orang yang memberi dan enyahkanlah apa yang mereka miliki dari orang orang yang menahannya
5066920 perbedaan antara kamu berdua adalah sesuai dengan jawabanmu atas pertanyaanku
5066921 beribadah dan bertasbih kepada allah seolah olah kamu berada dalam kehadiran nya seolah olah kamu melihat nya
5066922 wahai jasmani yang sementara kau benci mendengar perundingan tapi dengarlah apakah kau yakin saat kau menghirup udara itu bukanlah nafasmu yang terakhir allah mahatahu tapi nafas berikutnya mungkin merupakan nafas yang terakhir di dunia ini yang kepadanya kamu begitu terikat kematian akan menyergapmu melalui tenggorokan namun kau bertahan menimbun kesalahan demi kesalahan dosa demi dosa sang hakim terakhir memperingatkan orang orang yang terus menerus berbuat dosa dengan siksa yang gunung batu sekalipun tidak akan mampu menanggungnya bagaimana mungkin kau yang sangat kecil bak sebatang jerami akan menanggung siksa yang mengerikan seperti itu jangan palingkan punggungmu pada yang satu yang menciptakan kamu menghadaplah kepada nya dan bertobatlah lakukan ini sekarang jangan tunda karena kamu tidak tahu kapan kematian akan memisahkanmu menjadi dua
5066923 sungguh setelah aura kematian membuatmu bertekuk lutut dan kehidupan tengah memudar lantas kamu sepenuhnya mengingat dan menyesal penyesalan itu tidak akan diterima oleh allah nabi yang dia utus sebagai rahmat untuk semesta bersabda bahwa sekalipun allah menerima tobatmu hingga saat ketika nafasmu sedang ditarik darimu pada saat sekarat tapi itu sudah sangat terlambat kematian datang tanpa memberi peringatan pada sebagian orang selama makan pada sebagian orang selama minum pada yang lain selama tidur dengan istrinya pada yang lain lagi saat tidur nyenyak yang kemudian tidak pernah bangun lagi siapa pun sebelum itu yang tidak beralih dari kesalahan menuju kebenaran tidak menyesal melainkan tekun berbuat dosa akan jatuh ke jurang kematian
5066924 aku berlindung dalam rahmat mu dalam keindahan mu dalam kelembutan mu dari murka mu dan dari kekuatan mu aku berlindung dalam kasih dan sayang mu dari siksa mu aku berlindung kepada mu dari mu
5066925 jika bukan karena dosa dosamu dan perlawanan perlawananmu bagaimana allah akan mengejawantahkan kasih sayang dan kedermawanan nya yang tak terbatas
5066926 kamu tidak punya harapan mencapai tingkatan kebaikan mereka yang terlahir dengan akhlak terpuji dan penuh ketaatan mereka telah lahir ke dunia ini dan menunjukkan ketaatannya pada kehendak allah mengumpulkan rahmat dan karunia tuhannya di dunia ini dan meninggalkannya rahmat kedermawanan dan kelembutan allah yang sebenarnya akan mengejawantah di akhirat pada hari pengadilan ketika dia memutuskan para hamba nya yang tidak taat membutuhkan rahmat nya
5066927 apa yang kau katakan tentang kesabaran dan kedermawanan allah yang tak terbatas pada para hamba nya adalah benar
5066928 jika aku tahu pasti bahwa tidak ada hari perhitungan atas dosa dosaku bahwa tidak ada hukuman dan jika aku yakin bahwa aku akan menerima ampunan ilahi aku bisa mempertimbangkan alasanmu yang berbelit belit
5066929 pada sisi lain bahkan sekalipun aku yakin bahwa aku akan menerima hukuman ilahi aku pantas merasa malu dan bersyukur atas penundaan hukuman nya dan mengerahkan semua upayaku untuk mematuhi perintah perintah tuhan ku
5066930 aku tidak pernah mendengar kata baik bahwa semua dosa akan diampuni sebaliknya seseorang dibiarkan bebas memilih antara yang benar dan yang salah dan sang hakim terakhir bebas untuk memaafkan atau menghukumnya dalam hal kamu tentu wahai jiwa yang selalu memerintahkan keburukan tidak ada pilihan kamu terus menerus berada dalam keinginanmu melakukan kesalahan dan larangan
5066931 siapapun yang lebih menyukai dunia daripada akhirat menganggung derita tiga hal beban tak tertahankan yang tidak pernah diringankan keadaan miskin yang tidak pernah jadi lebih kaya dan ambisi rasa lapar yang tidak pernah terpuaskan
5066932 kami adalah orang yang menyerahkan segala urusannya di kedua tangan allah dan kami beriman kepada nya
5066933 kamu hanyalah beban bagi orang lain parasit di atas usaha usaha orang lain karena orang yang betul betul beriman kepada allah pertama tama menanam benih di perut bumi ini kemudian berharap memperkirakan dan menyerahkan urusan urusannya di tangan sang maha pemberi rezeki
5066934 jadilah anak anak akhirat bukan anak anak fana bumi yang akan kembali ke tanah
5066935 buatlah perhitunganmu sebelum perhitungan dibuat untukmu timbanglah dosa dosamu sebelum ia ditimbang untukmu
5066936 jika anda tidak datang ke tempat si anu dan anu saya akan pergi
5066937 maka duduklah di mana kamu berada dan biarkan dia memberimu makan
5066938 itu adalah allah yang telah membuatnya menemukan kebutuhan kebutuhanmu dan menempatkan kedermawanan itu di dalam hatinya
5066939 aku adalah kekayaan tersembunyi aku cinta untuk dikenal dan dengan cinta inilah aku ciptakan makhluk
5066940 wahai manusia kamu bersekutu dengan binatang dalam dirimu dan kamu bersekutu dengan malaikat dalam dirimu tinggalkan watak binatangmu di belakang agar kamu bisa naik melampaui malaikat
5066941 lihatlah seluruh makhluk di bawah cahaya tunggal sehingga kamu akan melihat kebenaran hanya ada satu cahaya tapi di bawah cahaya itu terlihat semua yang berbeda cahaya itu menyatukan semuanya inilah makna ketunggalan wujud
5066942 tidak ada pahala yang dapat diterima seorang manusia karena prestasi prestasinya yang sepadan dengan kebahagiaan yang dihadiahkan kepada siapapun yang menunjukkan kasih sayang pada umat manusia
5066943 allah telah mengamanahkan binatang binatang kepada manusia untuk dirawat perlakukanlah ia dengan baik ketika kamu menggunakannya untuk membawa barang barang jangan terlalu memberatkannya ketika menunggangnya jangan kau duduk di punggungnya dengan pongah
5066944 semoga allah yang menatap segala sesuatu membuka mata batinmu agar kamu bisa melihat dan mengingat apa yang kamu lakukan dan pikirkan apa yang kamu rasakan dan katakan dalam hidupmu sehari hari
5066945 buatlah perhitunganmu sendiri sebelum ia dibuat untukmu timbang dosa dosamu sebelum ia ditimbang untukmu
5066946 selama kamu hidup kamu bagaikan seorang pengumpul banyak keuntungan dari karunia allah yang sampai kepadamu dari begitu banyak tangan
5066947 bukankah aku telah mengirimkan para utusan kepadamu bukankah aku telah menunjukkan jalan yang benar kepadamu
5066948 bacalah semua catatan milikmu sendiri cukuplah dirimu hari ini untuk menyelesaikan sebuah perhitungan terhadapmu qs al isra 17 14
5066949 jika kamu menunggu hingga saat saat terakhir kamu tidak akan menerima kebaikan apapun dari penyesalanmu
5066950 ada tiga bahaya yang bisa menahanmu dari memeriksa dirimu pertama ketaksadaran berikutnya lamunan kenikmatan akibat tipu daya hawa nafsumu ketiga menjadi seorang budak kebiasaan kebiasaanmu
5066951 dalam keadaan apapun kenalilah dirimu bahkan sekalipun kamu lebih baik daripada siapapun yang lain mohonlah kepada allah dan bekerjalah untuk keadaan yang lebih baik dalam segala hal yang kamu kerjakan jangan pernah melupakan allah
5066952 perlakukanlah setiap orang secara sama apakah mereka raja atau fakir miskin tua atau muda
5066953 perlakukanlah dengan baik mereka yang menjadi tanggung jawabmu istri dan suamimu anak anakmu orang orang yang bekerja untukmu binatang binatang dalam piaraanmu tetanaman di kebunmu
5066954 seluruh makhluk adalah tanggung jawab allah allah telah meninggalkan sedikit tanggung jawab nya di kedua tanganmu tunjukkan cinta kasih sayang kelembutan kedermawanan dan perlindungan kepada mereka yang tergantung kepadamu dan sebetulnya pada setiap orang
5066955 ajari anak anakmu tingkah laku yang baik dengan kata kata allah dalam kitab suci nya
5066956 dalam semua kebaikan yang kamu lakukan jangan mengharapkan balas jasa atau rasa terima kasih ketika seseorang membuatmu sedih jangan balas dengan membuat mereka sedih allah memandang tanggapan seperti itu sebagai dosa dan dia memuji orang yang membalas mereka yang telah menyakiti hatinya dengan kebaikan
5066957 perhatikanlah perintah allah dan takutlah kepada keadilan nya dalam hal apapun yang kamu lakukan dalam apapun yang kamu katakan
5066958 aku bersaksi bahwa tidak ada tuhan kecuali allah dan aku bersaksi bahwa muhammad adalah hamba nya dan utusan nya
5066959 aku tidak tertampung di langit dan bumi ciptaan ku tapi aku tertampung dalam hati hamba ku yang beriman
5066960 segala puji milik allah tuhan seluruh alam sang mahakasih sang mahasayang
5066961 hamba ku mengenalku dan dia memuji ku karena aku mencintainya dan aku mengampuni kesalahan kesalahannya
5066962 hamba ku mengenal ku bahwa dia akan kembali kepada ku dan membutuhkan pada keadilan dan ampunan ku
5066963 di mana seluruh wujud sadar atas tindakan tindakan dan pernyataan pernyataan lahirnya serta pemikiran pemikiran dan perasaan batinnya berjanji untuk tunduk kepada kehendak tuhannya dan mohon pertolongan nya dengan menyatakan bahwa tidak ada satu tempat pun untuk pergi kecuali kepada nya tidak ada seorang pun untuk dimintai pertolongan kecuali kepada nya
5066964 wahai lidah kau bilang bahwa kamu tunduk kepada ku dan minta pertolongan dari ku semata tapi seluruh organ tubuh itu yang telah mewakilkan kamu untuk menuturkan kepada ku kedua matamu pikiranmu hatimu telah melupakan ku maka apa yang kamu katakan betul betul sebuah kebohongan belaka
5066965 jalan mereka yang telah engkau anugerahi kenikmatan bukan mereka yang engkau murkai dan mereka yang tersesat
5066966 ketika tuhanku menyuruhku mengumandangkan azan aku melihat bahwa setiap kata yang keluar dari mulutku membentang hingga jarak sejauh mata memandang
5066967 seluruh amal dan ibadah manusia adalah untuk mereka sendiri dan milik mereka hanya puasalah untuk ku dan balasannya adalah dari ku
5066968 orang yang memberikan sebagian kekayaannya akan menerima lebih banyak dari allah dibandingkan apa yang dia berikan itu orang kikir selain dosa kekikirannya bersalah karena tidak mempercayai sang maha pemberi rezeki ia lebih bergantung pada harta kekayaannya yang hina ketimbang pada kedermawanan tuhannya karena itu nafkahkanlah sebagian dari apa yang telah allah berikan kepadamu dan jangan takut miskin allah akan memberimu apa yang telah ditakdirkan untukmu baik kamu memintanya atau tidak tak pernah ada dermawan binasa dalam kemiskinan
5066969 tidak ini seorang wali bukan seorang kafir dia adalah ungkapan keadilan ilahi bukan seorang yang melanggar agama
5066970 dia bersabda lindungilah dirimu dari kemurkaan allah dan hukuman nya dengan memberi orang yang membutuhkan bahkan sekalipun dengan setengah butir kurma
5066971 ya tuhan aku datang aku disini dalam ketaatan siap menerima perintah mu tidak ada apapun selain engkau seluruh puji adalah milik mu semua milik mu tiada sekutu bagi mu
5066972 vivir con prisa es una peligrosa costumbre porque nos hace dogm ticos al mismo tiempo que nos impide ser due os de nuestras opiniones el dogmatismo es la prisa de las ideas el acomodo a discursos establecidos por encima de nuestra conciencia el sacrificio de la responsabilidad propia en el altar de una verdad nacionalista religiosa partidista o medi tica quien vive con prisa dice lo primero que se le ocurre lo que corre al lado de l as que anda de cabeza y piensa con los pies si tuvi ramos tiempo de pensar dos veces lo que decimos y sobre todo lo que nos dicen otro gallo cantar a en el mundo sin caer en la caricatura de la pereza por supuesto conviene reivindicar la lentitud del sur como un mbito de responsabilidad propia el nico mbito que permite los paseos largos y las buenas decisiones en el sur no deben tener prisa ni los pensamientos ni los coches ni los desnudos la sensualidad y la belleza requieren su tiempo

5067069 babies were not washed as they emerged from the womb but sometimes licked by the mother
5067070 the most convincing clue we have comes from sir charles bell bell wrote that he once visited a spot on the tibet bhutan border where he saw a stupa called bang kar bi tse cho ten that contained the bodies of an eight year old boy and girl who had been slain for the purpose of some religious ritual
5067071 scenting the corpses and blood a demon took possession of the ch ten
5067072 the slavery in the chumbi valley was of a very mild type
5067073 more people were executed in china in the last three months than in the rest of the world for the last three years
5067074 told the government that they were only able to do it because their parents had told them how it was done
5067075 toil and trouble slavery is on the rise in china as number of poor migrants increases beijing appears unwilling and unable to prevent it
5067076 the two races differ strongly in many qualities which have their roots deep down in the characters of the two nations firstly the tibetans are deeply religious the tibetan government is truthful it can be slow obstinate and secretive in dealing with foreigners but it has a strong regard for truth but the chinese authorities from time to time made statements which were deliberately untrue the chinese are far more cruel than the tibetans are when they tried to conquer areas in tibet they used to put to death what prisoners of war they captured although the only offence of these was fighting in defence of their homeland the tibetans when they captured chinese prisoners of war used simply to send them back to china the chinese treat the granting of a favour merely as a step towards asking for another the tibetans do not treat favours in this way they have a national memory of things for which they are grateful many other examples of the differences dividing these two nations could be given for instance the status of women in tibet is higher than china the kinder treatment of animals and the more orderly government

5067079 a survey made in 1940 in eastern tibet came to a somewhat different conclusion it found that 38 percent of the households never got any tea but either collected herbs that grew wild or drank white tea boiled water it found that 51 percent could not afford to use butter and that 75 percent of the households were forced at times to resort to eating grass cooked with cow bones and mixed with oat or pea flower
5067080 there is no method of torture known that is not practised in here on these tibetans slicing boiling tearing asunder and all to sum up what china is doing here in eastern tibet the main things are collecting taxes robbing oppressing confiscating and allowing her representatives to burn and loot and steal
5067081 is credited with having introduced into tibet the use of butter tea cheese barley beer medical knowledge and astrology
5067082 all researchers reach a point of diminishing returns where to continue without publishing only postpones the inevitable
5067083 chinese tibetan and nepali sources are not very plentiful on the whole and not readily accessible even if one has the necessary language skills
5067084 who on the face of it had neither the qualification nor any business to write on india
5067085 we in india are accustomed to interested publication patronized patronized is accepted as an elegant synonym for subsidized by the government i hope miss mayo will not take offence if she comes under the shadow of such suspicion
5067086 they used to write that everything in china was wrong now they write that everything in china is right
5067087 this must surely rank as one of the wonders of the global village beijings master image makers giving lessons in balance and objectivity to american journalists
5067088 tibetan historian tom grunfeld a longtime friend and fellow ccas committee of concerned asian scholars activist from the 1970s with good access to senior chinese officials responsible for the territory was allowed to visit lhasa where he lobbied on our behalf two months later we were thrilled to receive a telex from the lhasa waiban inviting cnn to tibet
5067089 a decade earlier mutual aid teams were formed then agricultural cooperatives and finally in 1965 66 peoples communes mechanization has begun and experimental agricultural stations have developed more resilient higher yield grains as well as strains of tobacco tea sugar beets and a dozen vegetables which can grow readily in the climate of the roof of the world innovations such as insecticides chemical fertilizers irrigation and veterinary medicine have been introduced into a land that hardly even know of their existence in short the lot of the tibetan people has improved immeasurably
5067090 there were between three to four thousand villages and towns each having between three to four thousand families with four to five thousand people from each town and village about 800 to 1 000 people were imprisoned out of this at least 300 to 400 people of them died in prison
5067091 if there was a film made on all the atrocities perpetrated in qinghai province it would shock the viewers in golok area many people were killed and their dead bodies were rolled down the hill into a big ditch the soldiers told the family members and relatives of the dead people that they should all celebrate since the rebels had been wiped out they were even forced to dance on the dead bodies soon after they were also massacred with machine guns they were all buried there

5067118 the writing on this film is so human so rich and fun a lot of humor in the movie
5067119 there are so many moments in this movie that i think hard core fans are just going to love
5067120 if it is done the way i think it will be done i think hearts will be in stomachs it is this idea of seeing these characters in a different light i have seen some of the movie i have seen very rough sequences that j j showed me the one where you first sort of see enterprise and you first sort of see the convergence of the crew of the enterprise is a pretty profound moment for me

5067168 along comes mccain who not only has he doesnt like to talk about his religion very much and then he talks about it openly but he has a very powerful story thats emotionally connected to the audience
5067169 its the candidate who can connect emotionally to middle america who will have the big advantage going down the stretch

5067176 john mccains going to be a much tougher opponent for barack obama in the debates than anybody ever might have imagined just a few weeks ago
5067177 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5067178 hes a man of few words but when he tells stories he connects
5067179 i thought barack obamas answer tonight was helpful to him and addressed a couple of things because theres been a lot of doubt about his christian faith
5067180 i think he also helped to dispel the myth that hes such an elitist and hes arrogant he was quite humble in that answer and many others
5067181 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5067182 those are the judges that the evangelicals that social conservative voters want to hear from john mccains own lips that he opposes and that he would not support because the issue of judges is perhaps one of the most if not the most important issue for many social conservatives
5067183 the voters out there who went out in large numbers for george w bush that is one of the things that they want to hear from john mccain because that is something that gives them a lot more faith in john mccain

5067197 i always find the people i see in the middle of the day are better than the people in the morning
5067198 what we are not looking for is the people who are trying to be bad because anyone who is trying to be bad really isnt that interesting

5067207 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data

5067209 its important not to let them have a good start they are the sort of batsmen who will take chances
5067210 when the question of jayasuriyas importance was put to jayawardene he spontaneously drew the comparison between jayasuriya and sehwag
5067211 sanath in form is always a great thing because both with the bat and as well as with the ball he can contribute
5067212 and the start he gets makes a huge difference if he stays for 10 or 15 overs you are guaranteed a good start
5067213 but jayawardene did not put the onus of run getting solely on jayasuriya
5067214 generally batting plays a big role in one day cricket
5067215 after the world cup we lacked a bit of consistency we didnt consistently maintain our standards the asia cup is where we turned it around where we maintained consistency with bat ball and in the field thats the toughest thing to consistently be in that competitive level
5067216 i dont think its just the wicket the wind is a factor the wicket seems to have a bit in it for both fast bowlers and spinners a bit of bounce and spin
5067217 thats a contributing factor for low scores it looks a good fresh hard wicket so you dont know
5067218 we havent been at our best bowling wise we can probably do a bit better on placid tracks and were working on that
5067219 youre talking about a guy whos a surefire hall of famer in his sport
5067220 theres been a lot of great players but hes the only one of the real superstars that has played with an organization at that kind level and for that long
5067221 you have to win a championship to be even considered
5067222 for someone like me who likes both sports baseball and basketball its pretty difficult to pick one thats actually better
5067223 theyre pretty equal to be honest with you with what theyve done
5067224 at the end of the day im not upset i put my heart on the track it wasnt a stellar time for me either but i did well today

5067232 like many of our employees i was a customer using our technology in the lab i saw that it was cool technology and i started enjoying the technology itself more than what i was doing with it i came as a customer and moved from the east coast to join as a research and development tech that was 12 years ago
5067233 we have the feeling of a startup when we go into new market areas using dna and forensic analysis like what you see on csi for the work we do in bio security and anthrax detection the culture of taking new technology into real life applications makes work unique here

5067236 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5067237 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5067238 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5067239 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5067240 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5067241 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5067265 i grew up on the he man cartoon and watched he man six days a week the notion that i think we most took from the cartoon are the characters and trying to find a way that is true to them
5067266 now at the same time we had to come up with why that is the way it is i mean youre talking about sword and sandal meets science fiction meets fantasy meets everything and how does that all kind of blend into the same world and so we had to come up with very specific rules that explained why trapjaw looks the way he looks and why cyclops who is awesome looks the way he looks
5067267 the script is very true to the characters were not talking about putting nipples on the trapjaw suit but we had to come up with a reason again why trapjaw would actually not just be something thats totally absurd but why he would need those bionic parts added to him
5067268 which gives a sort of sense of where the movie is going in some way
5067269 that was one of the things director zack snyder said to me from the start i really want this to be incredibly brutal its not a turn on kind of story its bad its important that we did that i think hopefully it will be really powerful

5067273 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5067274 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5067275 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5067276 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5067277 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5067278 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5067279 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

5067315 one of the goals of transition towns is for people to relearn the skills used before we had this huge amount of cheap oil to produce all the plastics and components that go into all the electronics we now depend on
5067316 at the moment people are really focusing on the price of petrol and food which is driving a lot of the urgency they are feeling around peak oil and climate change and transition towns offer them a way to take positive action
5067317 oil is a finite resource and its going to start to diminish
5067318 the more we plan for the changes this will necessitate the easier it will be
5067319 enjoyable exciting and a transition to a future we would all want to live in

5067330 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
5067331 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
5067332 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening

5067355 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5067356 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5067357 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5067358 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5067359 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5067360 i do not know where my children are and you can imagine how i feel about it
5067361 georgia is a sovereign state and the territorial integrity of the state must be provided for
5067362 our enemies who had once dropped bombs on us were now bringing us food and coal to heat our homes with

5067386 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5067387 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5067388 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5067389 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5067390 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5067391 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5067392 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5067393 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5067394 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5067395 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5067396 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5067397 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5067398 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5067399 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5067400 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit

5067402 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
5067403 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
5067404 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
5067405 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
5067406 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia

5067408 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5067409 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5067410 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5067411 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5067412 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5067413 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
5067414 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
5067415 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5067416 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5067417 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5067418 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5067419 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
5067420 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson
5067421 if god exists why is there evil if god is all powerful why doesnt he stop bad things from happening
5067422 for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
5067423 where is the opposite reaction to the force entering this dimension where is the opposing force to gods presence
5067424 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
5067425 if we try hard enough well be able to save the world
5067426 and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bare ishmael to abram
5067427 verily i say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
5067428 lo allah is with those who keep their duty unto him and restrain themselves and those who are doers of good
5067429 the inspiration for pursuing this job came from me looking for a change out of the financial world
5067430 most of my career has been on the financial end at freehold i got to get more involved in the management end of things my jobs at freehold were about 50 percent financial in nature and 50 percent operational so i wanted to go into that side of the business
5067431 i can understand people feeling that way but heres the other side of the coin
5067432 the bottom line here is that this is a business not only a business for njsea but it is a business for horse owners and for someone to actually appreciate what they have to go through what their financial involvement is that should be a plus
5067433 when youre in finance youre pretty much bottom line driven
5067434 now you have to pay attention to smaller details sometimes there is a sacrifice on the financial end to put on a quality race and you have to be aware of that
5067435 a bunch of guys five of us would pile into this small vw and go to liberty bell outside philadelphia and id do my 2 across the board that was the only bet i knew it was a lot of fun
5067436 i say that because the public has said that we dont want to travel 20 miles to the track we want to go 15 minutes and enjoy racing at otws off track wagering facilities
5067437 other people want to go on the internet place bets and watch it on tv or streaming video
5067438 to me the solutions are that we have to put the product close to where people are
5067439 otws are the way to do it we have to make facility improvements its going to take an investment in the facilities to bring people back to the track
5067440 my interest in horse racing is that ive been working in it 20 years just on a different side of the conference table
5067441 if youre around this business you cant help but like it
5067442 from my standpoint i need to spend some time to get to know the people
5067443 njsea has people that are still here from when i worked here theyre pretty much dedicated to the sport its reconnecting with them getting their feelings on what has happened over the last few years understanding their view point im a hands on kind of guy
5067444 as i get deeper into the job here and peel some of the layers off ill get a better picture
5067445 its premature for me to speak to the financial health of the tracks
5067446 whats encouraging is that betting state wide over the last five years is only down three percent per year
5067447 but when you look at the track theyre down much more than that there is not a dying interest in the sport its just that we need to put it in a different venue to accommodate people
5067448 come korah we have one more to find then moira will be able to rest in peace

5067480 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years

5067483 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
5067484 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would

5067490 pharmaceutical companies invest an average of more than 500 million over more than a decade to bring new medicines to patients
5067491 what nice fails to mention is that the medicines in question are in common use elsewhere in europe where prices are typically higher than they are here in the uk
5067492 nice has an important job to do but they need to adapt their approach for cancer medicines rather than lay the blame on the process and economics of pharmaceutical innovation
5067493 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
5067494 the share price is very important to a pharmaceutical company pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
5067495 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5067496 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5067497 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5067498 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5067499 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5067500 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5067501 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5067502 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5067503 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5067504 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5067505 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5067506 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5067507 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person
5067508 hes definitely much more relaxed than you would think he was
5067509 he has been in this offense for what a week as fast as he has been getting everything its ridiculous

5067516 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5067517 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5067518 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5067519 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5067520 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5067521 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5067522 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5067523 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5067524 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5067525 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first
5067526 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
5067527 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
5067528 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
5067529 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work

5067533 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5067534 effectively would be wiped out and their preferred shares left bereft of dividends
5067535 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
5067536 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
5067537 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
5067538 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
5067539 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
5067540 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
5067541 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
5067542 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
5067543 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
5067544 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
5067545 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
5067546 unless they bring some comprehensive changes in the security this deployment will not affect peoples confidence
5067547 people are afraid to leave their house after 7 p m
5067548 in saying that as a person of faith obama believes that things will work out and that we will get the president we need he may be picking up on the sovereignty of god whose ways are perfect but one hopes he understands that god in his sovereignty can visit catastrophe on a wayward people if we are spiritually unwise in our choice of leaders we may well get a spanking we need
5067549 mccain answers questions by telling stories obama answers like an academic i think people like storytellers better than professors they will like mccains simple yes and no responses obama tries to show he would be a good leader by recognizing nuance and complexity mccain tries to show he would be a good leader by being decisive
5067550 to grant that abortion is a moral issue but to duck when human life begins is at best inconsistent one would think it is vital no pun intended to think though exactly that question obamas unguarded line about not punishing a daughter of his with a child really hurt him in the pro life movement
5067551 obama has correctly refocused the abortion question on how women experience pregnancy and abortion for far too long the discussion has focused solely on fetuses as if they exist somehow independent of the women in whose bodies they reside
5067552 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5067553 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5067554 obama will be hammered by the religious right for that pay grade answer
5067555 specious obama has made that very determination in opening the law wide to the killing of the unborn
5067556 specifically says that neither biologists nor doctors nor theologians can agree upon the moral status of the fetus
5067557 absolute certainty that the woman herself does have moral status then the conservative thing to do is to protect the womans interests first
5067558 still does not answer the question of what to do when there is a conflict with the rights of the woman
5067559 if he believes in human rights at the moment of conception then he ought to be against embryonic stem cell research ivf and even the so called rhythm method
5067560 which has the effect of timing intercourse not only to prevent conception but also to allow conception at a time when the fertilized egg will drop into a uterus that is not at the right time of month for implantation
5067561 evaded the question of whether he will or will not continue to support embryonic stem cell research as long as the scientists say it is necessary
5067562 odd not to ask it after all if you are going to talk to someone about religion youd be interested to know their thoughts about the central figure in their religion
5067563 is why there were not representatives from other faith communities who are also voting this is a multi religious nation
5067564 personal testimony and scripture citation are both treasured by evangelicals
5067565 mccains knowledge and strong stance for what is just and right he also expressed a sense of humor that i have not seen before
5067566 the big western debate is whether this is about georgia or russia
5067567 those who want to contain the damage say that georgia is a little country partly to blame and not worth the confrontation with moscow then there are those who say this is really about russia and the rules of the game for europe writ large for the caspian energy corridor and the right of small countries to choose their own path
5067568 how do they square their increasing energy dependence on russia with their increasing political discomfort with putin its a very hard circle to square
5067569 will only be reinforced in its view that georgia and ukraine are not ready for nato
5067570 there is little disagreement now in europe about the nature of the new russia
5067571 europe is torn between old and new europe but i dont see europe prepared to go to war with itself over georgia the european foreign ministers sense this is too big for them and they will in the end align themselves with the united states while trying to affect policy
5067572 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5067573 in an irony sure to set blogger hearts beating giddily the film graces the cover of ews new fall preview issue
5067574 ew and warner bros share a parent company but they clearly do not share you know important information

5067576 its almost like weve got two things to worry about the media trial and the police they actually impact on each other hugely which is scary and its not fair on tony

5067580 the players came in with a great attitude and they definitely worked hard over the summer
5067581 they have a burning desire and passion to reestablish bulldog football in the 08 season they know that the trail and path we want to go is very rough but they are really excited about the journey
5067582 there have been a lot of kids working hard to be a part of this team in any capacity
5067583 i am looking to put young guys on the field against veteran guys and see how they hold up that is what we are going to see at rutgers
5067584 it just shows that our peers and our business respect our program
5067585 now we have to win we have great tests early we have to see if we can maintain that momentum
5067586 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
5067587 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
5067588 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5067589 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5067590 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5067591 the more you smoke the more likely you are to have a stroke
5067592 certainly quitting is the best thing you could do but cutting back does offer some benefit
5067593 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
5067594 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
5067595 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
5067596 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
5067597 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
5067598 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
5067599 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
5067600 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
5067601 what do you want your look to say to people
5067602 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
5067603 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
5067604 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
5067605 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
5067606 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
5067607 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
5067608 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5067609 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5067610 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5067611 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5067612 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5067613 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5067614 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5067615 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
5067616 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
5067617 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
5067618 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
5067619 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
5067620 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
5067621 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
5067622 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5067623 its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career ill never forget it
5067624 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
5067625 to serve you have to push yourself up to jump up and when the legs are a little bit slow it just doesnt go
5067626 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5067627 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
5067628 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
5067629 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
5067630 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
5067631 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5067632 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5067633 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5067634 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5067635 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5067636 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5067637 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5067638 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5067639 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5067640 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5067641 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5067642 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5067643 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5067644 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5067645 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5067646 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5067647 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5067648 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5067649 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5067650 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5067651 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5067652 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5067653 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5067654 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5067655 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5067656 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5067657 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5067658 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5067659 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5067660 well that isnt fair my sponser doesnt get anything out of this
5067661 it puts us within around a point and a half of our 1999 election result and that shows a party very strongly keeping its base
5067662 i dont believe 51 percent can be held at all i think you get into a campaign environment things close up
5067663 so i think its game on im looking forward to the time when we down tools in parliament and get into full blooded campaign
5067664 the small parties get more publicity during a campaign as well i would be extremely surprised if the greens polled under 5 percent
5067665 you dont have to be a card carrying member of the social register to dine here but if you are not you will most likely be in the minority
5067666 oh just another asian convenience store dried eel is cool
5067667 woah yamamoto you work here let me help your uncles awesome store
5067668 this mexican joint went far beyond some customize able homemade gaucamole and a good margarita the food was exceptional

5067673 oh the long sleeve is a big thing and of course its a gorgeous day which i mean how many of them have we had so far this meet almost none and its supposed to be a good race day
5067674 this really is nice but im looking forward to the coolers that are coming up at the end of the month
5067675 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5067676 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5067677 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5067678 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5067679 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5067680 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5067681 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5067682 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5067683 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5067684 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5067685 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5067686 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5067687 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5067688 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5067689 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5067690 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5067691 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5067692 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5067693 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5067694 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5067695 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5067696 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5067697 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5067698 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5067699 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5067700 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5067701 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5067702 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5067703 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5067704 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5067705 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5067706 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5067707 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5067708 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5067709 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5067710 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5067711 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5067712 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5067713 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5067714 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5067715 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5067716 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5067717 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
5067718 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
5067719 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
5067720 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
5067721 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
5067722 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5067723 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5067724 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5067725 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5067726 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago

5067732 what is needed is for these small scale efforts to be implemented more broadly and scaled up dramatically
5067733 only through tackling the state of the environment on all fronts and with a variety of approaches will we be able to call a halt to environmental degradation global climate disruption and the ongoing mass extinction of species if we fail we will have a world of dirtier air scarce or undrinkable water and inadequate supplies of food
5067734 animals not only eat more food than they produce as edible meat but it takes 200 times the amount off water to produce one kg of meat as it does to grow one kg of soya which is another form of protein
5067735 it is a fitting coincidence because homo sapiens is now behaving in ways reminiscent of a spoiled teenager mistreating its life support systems mindless of the consequences
5067736 the study bursts a lot of myths and reiterates that efficiency in any field is not dependent on a persons gender
5067737 in our experience there is no major difference in the learning capabilities of men and women and there is nothing to suggest women are bad drivers

5067750 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5067751 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5067752 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
5067753 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
5067754 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
5067755 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
5067756 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
5067757 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble

5067764 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5067765 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5067766 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5067767 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5067768 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

5067773 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5067774 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5067779 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5067780 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis

5067782 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5067783 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
5067784 i will have to leave this behind and work hard for the next olympics in 2012
5067785 i am not worried about him i am more worried myself
5067786 i dont want to take anything for granted i would like to take it as just another fight
5067787 akhil has been on a roll since his recovery from a career threatening wrist injury he has been a revelation
5067788 i dont know whether i am a revelation or not but one thing that i know is i am trying to win here
5067789 we have to keep them in the best frame of mind
5067790 the boxers cant bet too emotional or too charged up there has to be a blance in their approach
5067791 we liked that ubuntu met all our development needs and that we could just download it and get to work
5067792 we didnt have to engage in any commercial relationship or even register the software this makes ubuntu very attractive for developers looking to innovate quickly and cost effectively it also combined the right amount of reliability with an unprecedented ease of use for linux it was a turnkey solution that was inherently secure something that made the microsoft users in my group relax
5067793 yeah but you know that woman has given me a lot of fine years

5067797 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5067798 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5067799 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5067800 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5067801 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5067802 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5067803 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5067804 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border

5067807 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5067808 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5067809 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5067810 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5067811 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5067812 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5067813 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5067814 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5067815 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5067816 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5067817 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5067818 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5067819 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5067820 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5067821 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5067822 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5067823 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5067824 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5067825 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5067826 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5067827 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5067828 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5067829 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5067830 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5067831 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5067832 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5067833 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5067834 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5067835 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5067836 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5067837 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5067838 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5067839 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5067840 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5067841 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5067842 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5067843 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5067844 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5067845 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5067846 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5067847 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5067848 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5067849 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5067850 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5067851 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5067852 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5067853 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5067854 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5067855 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5067856 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5067857 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5067858 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5067859 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5067860 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5067861 boxing is in our blood this is the best way we can earn name and fame
5067862 boxing was always popular in the city and with the coming of some big names in the recent times the sport has fanned the imagination of many a youngster

5067865 while his talent and hard work are well documented phelps owes his success largely to his amazing physique which boasts of some unique features that leads to the belief that he was born only to swim
5067866 his unique constitution also produces less lactic acid than others which means phelps takes less time to recover and if he looks indefatigable at times its because of the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder which he was diagnosed with at the tender age of nine his daily routine is equally mindboggling
5067867 the quality of the box matters little success depends upon the person who sits in it
5067868 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money

5067871 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5067872 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5067873 much to our mutual disappointment i wont be appearing in qts forthcoming inglorious bastards due to insurmountable scheduling difficulties we really tried to make it work but in the end it just was not possible without severe ramifications elsewhere
5067874 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5067875 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5067876 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5067877 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5067878 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5067879 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5067880 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5067881 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5067882 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5067883 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5067884 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5067885 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5067886 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5067887 ik heb daarover deze week een positief bericht gekregen van miek goossens de adjunct van de directeur van de dienst
5067888 er staan in totaal zes gebouwen in die lijst ook nog een in koksijde een in oostende een in ieper en twee in kortrijk en het zwembad in de keizer karelstraat is er dus ook een van
5067889 alle kleedhokjes komen nog uit op het zwembad zoals vroeger
5067890 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5067891 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5067892 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5067893 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5067894 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5067895 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5067896 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5067897 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5067898 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5067899 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5067900 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5067901 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5067902 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5067903 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5067904 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5067905 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5067906 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5067907 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

5067916 tim wore his catholicism proudly he talked about it all the time
5067917 in fact russerts faith was not an elephant in the room it was the room it was the room he was raised in it was one of his great charms as was how he dealt with it in life and in our public discourse
5067918 catholicism was his base it was never his bias i think thats absolutely crucial and i will debate anyone who contends to the contrary
5067919 learnings from the political process for common ground in the catholic church
5067920 understood that the stakes were high he knew that better than most of us
5067921 he knew that the civility of our dialogue was under attack he knew that diversity in the public square takes work every day and he knew that our standards of journalism were being attacked
5067922 he understood what it meant to be called to be catholic and i think thats very important he took the call
5067923 currently the 20000 displaced families are being accommodated in 11 schools more schools are being designated as shelters the government agents and international agencies have assured us that there is enough food and medicines stock for now
5067924 we cant say that there is no humanitarian crisis in the north
5067925 theological concepts do not limp after reality they illuminate reality by displaying its future
5067926 theology is to penetrate the present reality the movement of history that which is driving history toward the future to reflect on the basis of the historical praxis of liberation is to reflect in the light of the future which is believed in and hoped for it is to reflect with a view to action which transforms the present but it does not mean doing this from an armchair rather it means sinking roots where the pulse of history is beating at this moment and illuminating history with the word of the lord of history who irreversibly committed himself to the present moment of humankind to carry it to its fulfillment
5067927 freedom is not something man has for himself but something he has for others it is not a possession a presence an object but a relationship between two persons being free means being free for the other because the other has bound me to him only in relationship with the other am i free
5067928 an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all
5067929 solidarity is for me to do well i have to be concerned with others doing well and vice versa the economy causes me to seek benefits in ways that benefit others too
5067930 only the concept of the mediation of human self creation in history can lead us to an accurate and fruitful understanding of the relationship between creation and redemption
5067931 the human work the transformation of nature continues creation only if it is a human act that is to say if it is not alienated by unjust socio economic structures

5067940 finland won their first five games and are in a great position
5067941 to finish top we need them to drop points but theres still a lot to play for and the important thing is for us to win our next game we have to positive and win all our remaining matches
5067942 its a blow not to have those two strikers but we are happy to see fletch progress
5067943 if we can produce another two or three to make the step up then thats not a bad return mark reynolds could make that move while the likes of paul caddis scott arfield and ross mccormack are also gaining first team experience ive no doubt that those lads can handle the step up given time
5067944 he is a young centre half and that is a position where experience is a big big thing
5067945 but he is a main player for motherwell and if you were being pushed into a corner to name the ones who can become full internationals thats the type who have a chance of coming through
5067946 paul has had an experience like playing against barcelona in the champions league so you would hope that he would comfortably handle an under 21 game with a lot riding on it at our level

5067948 an isaf unit on a mission to deny an insurgent safe haven has accidentally killed four civilians and wounded three others who were located inside a compound
5067949 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5067950 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5067951 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they militants would have known women and children were present

5067960 it was weird at first not seeing my leg there
5067961 but it didnt really faze me too much i woke up and just rubbed the end of my leg and realized this must be how all the other guys felt it was kind of hard to adjust
5067962 for that moment while theyre holding a card or picture of their loved one in one hand a loved one who was killed with their other hand theyre touching the warm face of tomas young
5067963 for a moment theyre allowing themselves to believe theyre touching the loved one theyll never touch again
5067964 all i knew was i met a man at walter reed hospital and i wanted everybody to meet him i wanted every american to meet him
5067965 we have succeeded in upgrading the capabilities of our planes and have increased the range of these planes to 3000km without refuelling
5067966 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5067967 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5067968 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
5067969 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5067970 there are ups and downs with a slight advantage to obama
5067971 if i dump this guy theyre going to say wait a minute weve got a horse here
5067972 i know that money cant buy votes but it does help in getting the word out
5067973 people in this district really like to see someone whos worked hard and getting out there and being accessible to them and thats pretty much in a nutshell what congressman walz has done
5067974 theyre making sure that they have heat and that they have you know its the staples the things you need you dont have to have jewelry
5067975 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5067976 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5067977 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5067978 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5067979 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5067980 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5067981 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5067982 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5067983 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5067984 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5067985 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5067986 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5067987 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5067988 we have several witnesses including the people that were in the pool a lifeguard maybe theyll be able to tell us exactly what happened
5067989 it appears at this point were dealing with an accident
5067990 the hotel pool industry the tourism industry has said for many years that nothing happens inside their pools so we have reduce the standards we have to reduce the training programs
5067991 this case will confirm we have to maintain the regulations and maintain the training programs
5067992 is it the public safety pool regulations component we have to work on is it the ratio of the number of lifeguards to patrons is it life guarding programs we have to revise
5067993 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5067994 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5067995 sometimes guys just have off years hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5067996 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5067997 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5067998 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5067999 we attempted to do so by the non waiver trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5068000 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5068001 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5068002 i was speechless yesterday for a while today i cried
5068003 little jamaica our country is blessed with some of the best if not the best talent you can find
5068004 were getting a pretty good taste of what its like to be at the bottom
5068005 when i was thinking about it i was getting ahead of myself
5068006 to win the champions league the premier league we need more than this
5068007 i said to anelka today you have three or four chances and you have to make one or two goals for me and for the people because i want the people to believe in you
5068008 today they played very well its important but more important is that the fans of chelsea saw a beautiful game
5068009 i bought two strikers and maybe i made a rod for my own back because you cant play 4 4 2 here
5068010 unless you play 4 5 1 you get overloaded theyre just too good
5068011 in the context of the season we can come from behind theres no question about that
5068012 there are 37 games left and its not a disaster we lacked real width and penetration to make a make a difference to that game and that was a real problem

5068023 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5068024 serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union

5068030 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5068031 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5068032 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5068033 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5068034 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5068035 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5068036 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5068037 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5068038 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5068039 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5068040 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles

5068046 no sounds like the girls are the ones getting screwed with the stupid dolls
5068047 ok if you tip it up on its end it sort of looks like an egg right now slice all the way around it but it wont go through as theres a pit inside
5068048 now once the cut is all the way around put one half in each hand and give it a twist
5068049 one side will have the pit in it take this side in your palm and give it a gentle squeeze the pit will just kinda pop out these is were some people lose fingers trying to cut it out with a knife
5068050 alright cut strips into it lengthwise and then do the same widthwise
5068051 wow thats pretty good that you go all that over the phone
5068052 fires in the borjomi forests are still continuing there was unfortunately no progress in the fight against the fires
5068053 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
5068054 we will be presenting the list as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5068055 he should tender his resignation pack up his bags and go
5068056 whatever little moral authority was left has now been completely eroded
5068057 this thing must be clear to everyone that president musharraf is not going to resign period
5068058 this is an issue that is not on the table
5068059 we want stability in the country we want political stability
5068060 we want to concentrate on winning and the best news for our supporters is to win games
5068061 in the first half they were attacking the second half we were on top and attacking and continued until the end
5068062 we had chances torres is a key player and he can change games for the team its really important to have these sorts of players
5068063 we tired in the last 15 to 20 minutes which is something i should take responsibility for we should have had some tougher games in pre season
5068064 for all the hard work the number of goals scored in the last 15 minutes is huge and the other 75 minutes goes out of the window
5068065 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5068066 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5068067 we just wanted to play as well as we can we wanted to start all guns blazing
5068068 last year we had a difficult start and the football we played in the first half today was top drawer
5068069 we can build on that the first half was as good as we can play
5068070 having not won anything last year we go in to this season with a real determination and i think we showed that
5068071 its not easy to come to a different country and settle in as quickly as he has his touch is fantastic and hes obviously going to be a great signing for us
5068072 its a first game of the season and we had a physical match on the wednesday night and i was a little bit worried before that we would not be very sharp but we started well and were in control and we just couldnt finish them off
5068073 you have that old story that you feel you probably deserved to be punished in the end but i am pleased we did not let in a goal
5068074 when everybody is here we can create more clear cut chances because today the final ball was not good enough
5068075 but overall it has been a good week for us
5068076 is a trophy to finish 12 and win the carling cup not for me
5068077 but you have no quality and are not there at the end of the championship
5068078 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title
5068079 if you dont win it of course you are frustrated
5068080 after you can say it is not good enough to win it okay but you have to accept levels are very high possibly the highest in the world and in the end two or three points is not a big gap
5068081 we were very close to doing it last season and were the most unlucky team with so many bad injuries
5068082 we finished with 83 points last season lost only three games and we have stability in our club which allows us to feel we will be better this year
5068083 i know we are not making the headlines with big names but what is important is what we produce on the pitch
5068084 nasri has shown that he is an intelligent player with a good technique who can integrate well with the rest of the team
5068085 he has shown also that he can add goals to his game which is what he started to do last season
5068086 we could have had a good hiding and after four minutes that was always going to be a possibility
5068087 but we worked very hard all over the pitch and as the game wore on we started posing a real threat and looked as if we could have scored a goal
5068088 if the goalkeeper hadnt pulled off some good saves and for a clearance off the line we might have been sitting here at 1 1
5068089 there are positives although we dont take much solace out of losing
5068090 but we came with a game plan trying to counter their slick passing play and although they created chances so did we
5068091 we played well in the first half and their goalkeeper made several good saves to keep them in the match
5068092 our attacking play in the first half was good but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle which is swollen up badly hell be out for two to three weeks we lost a bit of our experience in midfield
5068093 we ended up having to push patrice evra out to the left side of midfield and he is obviously not our best attacking player being a left back
5068094 newcastle were good on the counter attack and in goalscorer obafemi martins and damien duff they have players with quality in these positions if you dont stop them they can be dangerous
5068095 we had possession of the ball but didnt make it count at times but in light of the people we had missing it was a creditable result for us
5068096 right now everything looks good for the first two days
5068097 the concern is once the storm goes over water it can pick up steam well wait and see what city and state officials say as far as evacuating
5068098 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5068099 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5068100 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5068101 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy

5068150 the russians were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity
5068151 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
5068152 i think that they had an opportunity to make some very broad points to these nations and i think the russians seized that opportunity
5068153 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
5068154 i think russias got some serious work to do to try and work its way back into the family of nations that are trying to work together and build democracy and build their economies working together
5068155 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia

5068160 she wrote three guides for members who wanted to teach others about islam on the groups website siddiqui explained how to run a dawah table an informational booth used at school events to educate people about and persuade them to convert to islam
5068161 imagine our humble but sincere dawah effort turning into a major dawah movement in this country just imagine it and us reaping the reward of everyone who accepts islam through this movement through years to come think and plan big may allah give this strength and sincerity to us so that our humble effort continue and expands until america becomes a muslim land
5068162 not going out of her way to be noticed by anybody or to be anyones friend she just came out here to teach us about allah and english wasnt even her first language

5068168 there remains only one obstacle from which the enemy calls him from and this is an obstacle that he must face if anyone were to be saved from this obstacle it would have been the messengers and prophets of allah and the noblest of his creation this is the obstacle of satan unleashing his troops upon the believer with various types of harm by way of the hand the tongue and the heart this occurs in accordance with the degree of goodness that exists within the believer so the higher he is in degree the more the enemy unleashes his troops and helps them against him and overwhelms him with his followers and allies in various ways there is no way around this obstacle because the firmer he is in calling to allah and fulfilling his commands the more the enemy becomes intent upon deceiving him with foolish people so he has essentially put on his body armor in this obstacle and has taken it upon himself to confront the enemy for allahs sake and in his name and his worship in doing so is the worship of the best of worshippers

5068188 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
5068189 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
5068190 finding the olive backed forest robin strongly underscores the importance of our research this helps us show the conservation importance of the area

5068200 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5068201 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5068202 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5068203 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

5068249 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5068250 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5068251 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5068252 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5068253 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5068254 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5068255 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5068256 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5068257 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5068258 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5068259 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5068260 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5068261 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5068262 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5068263 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5068264 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5068265 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5068266 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5068267 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5068268 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5068269 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5068270 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5068271 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5068272 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5068273 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5068274 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5068275 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5068276 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5068277 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5068278 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5068279 we all had powerpc code that got rewritten and its not that hard its just time consuming rogue amoeba has six people and we managed to port from one platform to another adobe has almost 6 000 people and they cant pull it off
5068280 developers of new software started after the intel announcement at wwdc 2005 already know the deal use xcode and don t make assumptions about the underlying processor architecture the way apple has set things up with xcode once you re compiling a universal binary it s not that much more work to keep producing universal binaries than it would be to produce binaries for a single architecture
5068281 if soundbooth is written entirely in standard c or c and they re using gcc no extra writing is necessary the same c code can be compiled for both architectures those are two big ifs though
5068282 designed from the ground up to deliver high quality sound to web and video workflows
5068283 by porting a previously pc only piece of software to the mactels is doing all mac users a favor because it strengthens apples media production options
5068284 i just dont think were in a position to know whether these were right policies or wrong policies yet
5068285 but if adobe after researching the matter carefully chooses to save itself an unspecified amount of time and expense by not porting a new version of an existing program to a platform that it was never designed for this is not betrayal arrogance or stupidity
5068286 for example none of the adobe statements seemed to me to be arrogant but you obviously feel differently
5068287 mac users should be happy because adobe brought this software to the mac platform and that alone was enough
5068288 and for that matter why cant a jet turbine be made as quickly and cheaply as a two stroke weed eater

5068294 we have succeeded in upgrading the capabilities of our planes and have increased the range of these planes to 3 000km without refuelling

5068301 its a business thats pretty resilient in a downturn the result wont have any major surprises
5068302 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5068303 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5068304 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5068305 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5068306 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5068307 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5068308 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5068309 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5068310 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5068311 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5068312 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5068313 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5068314 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5068315 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5068316 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5068317 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5068318 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5068319 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5068320 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5068321 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5068322 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5068323 i heard screams the lamppole went down im shaking its terrible there are no words for this especially the screaming i hope everybody is ok
5068324 the cab coming down broadway was speeding like hell and ran the red light

5068330 the new hampshire grants a country unpeopled and almost unknown in the last war the french and indian war now abounds in the most active and rebellious race on the continent and hangs like a gathering storm on my left

5068335 he remembered verushka talking about some people seemingly being forever in search of the east pole she meant that they had simply misunderstood how things worked it was as though having heard of the south pole and the north pole they assumed there must be a west pole and an east pole too and so set off confidently expecting to find one or other of them never knowing they were inevitably destined to fail some hopes and amibitions were manifest only as a direction not a destination maybe the trick was to realise you were involved in a process not aiming at a completely achievable end result and accept that but travel hopefully anyway
5068336 i was poised to spend my life working those fields creating great wines and living the life my parents had enjoyed before me
5068337 then in my sophomore year at stanford glassy here changed everything
5068338 within a few months this little bugger had left the family vineyards barren from something called pierces disease heard of it
5068339 so i went down to one of my biology professors who gave me a complete briefing pierces will wipe out a vineyard crop faster than you can express your revulsion nothings left but twigs and dust
5068340 my dad died from the stress of that year my mother followed soon thereafter i sold the land and enrolled in law school now i owe my life to glassy

5068343 so im almost afraid to ask but where did you learn so much about explosives
5068344 you see im actually a secret agent assigned to ferret out seniors who would take advantage of poor innocent little freshmen like me
5068345 so what are the orders from secret agent headquarters when you locate such a miscreant
5068346 i must formally inform you that you are hereby charged with a violation of code 23 subsection 17 punishable by up to a year in prison or a 10 000 fine
5068347 since we all live in the town of sleepy hollow we thought it would be cool to call it holloween
5068348 the school board is likely to cut the stipend i get for teaching english in addition to molding young men to become gridiron warriors
5068349 i will not allow this mis spelling to embarrass what this school stands for
5068350 uh ms putterman did you see this mis spelling in the banner this young man has produced
5068351 i personally approved this project including the spelling which as you must know is a play on words do we have a problem here or do we need to go see mr slerper
5068352 uh well if you say its okay its okay with me just make sure everyone knows ive taught these kids how to spell correctly

5068365 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5068366 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5068367 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5068368 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5068510 the white population is older and very much centred around the ageing baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
5068511 the future of america is epitomised by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
5068512 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5068513 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5068514 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5068515 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5068516 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5068517 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5068518 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5068519 who are open to doing something on the production side
5068520 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5068521 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5068522 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5068523 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5068524 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5068525 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5068526 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5068527 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5068528 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5068529 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5068530 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5068531 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5068532 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5068533 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5068534 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5068535 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5068536 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5068537 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5068538 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5068539 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5068540 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5068541 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5068542 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5068543 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5068544 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5068545 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5068546 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5068547 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5068548 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5068549 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5068550 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5068551 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5068552 listen and understand it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles
5068553 do you know that the pharisees took offense when they heard what you said

5068572 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5068574 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5068575 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5068576 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5068577 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5068578 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5068581 if you value thinness and a large screen and keyboard in a subnotebook and dont watch dvds on planes or require spare batteries the macbook air might be just the ticket but if you rely on spare batteries expect the usual array of ports or like to play dvds on planes this isnt the computer to buy
5068582 still simply using the macbook air as im doing right now in writing this review is rather copasetic though i can quibble with a few of apples choices of what to take off the products dimensions and design make the case that the losses were not in vain the things that apple left on were the ingredients for a quality computer and did i mention how thin it is
5068583 given the compromises i dont expect anyone to use air as their only computer but it is a yummy machine for people who spend a lot of time traveling

5068592 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5068593 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5068594 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5068595 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5068599 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5068600 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5068601 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5068602 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5068603 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5068604 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5068605 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5068606 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5068607 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5068608 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5068609 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5068610 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet

5068615 the university authorities have now made clear that possession of this material is not required for the purpose of your course of study nor do they consider it legitimate for you to possess it for research purposes
5068616 there is no right to access and research terrorist materials those who do so run the risk of being investigated and prosecuted on terrorism charges equally there is no prohibition on accessing terrorist materials for the purpose of research those who do so are likely to be able to offer a defence to charges although they may be held in custody for some time while the matter is investigated this is the law and applies to all universities
5068617 the university of nottingham has always fully embraced this principle and continues to do so claims to the contrary are careless entirely false and bear little relation to the facts

5068623 i asked amar singh whether you had come here to sleep or listen to our grievances
5068624 this is an issue that is not on the table
5068625 president musharraf has been a good ally and everyone knows that we disagreed with his decision in terms of the state of emergency that he declared but he was just to his word he took off his uniform it is now a democratic government in pakistan
5068626 i want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5068627 we have been supportive of their new democratic government as witnessed by the presidents meetings with prime minister gilani so this is a matter for pakistan to determine
5068628 because these terrorists are not just after the united states and after afghanistan they are also after pakistan as demonstrated by the fact that they killed mrs bhutto
5068629 that is what we are concentrating on and helping pakistan to sustain its economy to build its schools its health we have a broad pakistan policy
5068630 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5068631 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5068632 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5068633 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5068634 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5068635 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5068636 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5068637 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5068638 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5068639 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5068640 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5068641 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5068642 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5068643 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5068644 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5068645 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5068646 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5068649 but do you remember the day you first came here
5068650 and every time you come in we have this same conversation
5068651 the first time you came here you made it clear that no matter what you ordered you wanted it served as a pizza you order sausage and egg you want sausage and egg pizza you order fish and chips you want fish and chips pizza and you tell me that no matter what you say in the future how much you scream and shout and protest this is what you want us to serve you so today you order chocolate sundae and chocolate sundae pizza is what we bring you
5068652 there was an incorrect map displayed on the rt website last night of georgia the problem was identified as a human error and occurred online it was rectified within the hour

5068673 nee en dat heeft harm ook al gezegd het klinkt afgezaagd maar de dood van stan is het gevolg van grote pech in gori de stad in georgi waar het incident plaatsvond leek het helemaal niet gevaarlijk er was geen sprake van een extreem gevaarlijke situatie of onverantwoord gedrag
5068674 iedere medaille op de spelen levert de publieke omroep extra kijkers op ik kijk uit naar het najaar toch hebben we niet stilgezeten voor het eerst hebben we s zomers nieuwe programmas ge ntroduceerd wie is de chef is zon succes dat het aan het buitenland wordt verkocht rtl ging niet meer op slot in de zomer
5068675 dat is mijn belangrijkste opdracht wij hebben een tijdje minder bewust gewerkt aan de zenderprofielen onder meer door de overname van talpa wij moeten nu weer heldere zenders neerzetten waar de kijker zich thuis voelt dat wil de adverteerder ook graag rtl 4 is de familiezender met shows in het weekeinde en thema avonden doordeweeks rtl 5 is jong en eigenzinnig voor kijkers tot 35 jaar rtl 7 wil de ultieme mannenzender zijn en rtl 8 wordt een zender voor vrouwen tussen 20 en 49
5068676 ja we hebben echt een slag gemaakt de profielen staan heel stevig targets ga ik niet noemen onze ambitie is om in het najaar weer lekker marktleider te zijn maar goed the proof of the pudding is in the eating
5068677 er is meer sprake van evolutie dan revolutie in je moet proberen te innoveren binnen het genre het programma uitstel van executie vind ik zon vernieuwing wij renoveren en verkopen een huis dat anders bij executie zou worden geveild omdat de bewoners in financi le problemen zijn geraakt dat is een mooi voorbeeld hoe een commerci le omroep aandacht kan besteden aan een maatschappelijk probleem
5068678 onze belangrijkste aanwinst is radio 538 wij zijn marktleider in radio verder hebben we een vierde zender aan onze
5068679 de mol mag formats uitproberen op de zenders die afspraak stond in onze deal met talpa dat gaat in goed overleg met onze programmadirectie het levert veel creatieve buzz op in het programmabedrijf ik hou van holland is een ander voorbeeld en er komen nog meer programmas aan
5068680 het is makkelijker om een familiezender te vullen zonder voetbal naar de samenvattingen op zondag keken heel veel mensen maar ze maakten het profiel van rtl 4 onduidelijk
5068681 ik wil daarin een flinke stap zetten we moeten sneller inspelen op nieuwe ontwikkelingen dan vroeger niet alleen als verlengstuk van programmas maar ook als zelfstandige initiatieven naast massamedia geloof ik in een op eencommunicatie wat we doen rond de formule 1 is een goed voorbeeld e mailnieuwsbrieven een tijdschrift tickets voor races de inkomsten komen uit advertenties maar meer uit transacties als rtlvideo nl kijkers betalen een paar euro om een film te zien we zitten nu op 40 000 downloads per maand

5068688 its not like black conservatives have nothing to say here hoover institution scholar shelby steele wrote a book about obama tom sowell has regularly written about him as have i
5068689 the relevant question is not if obama means the end of black politics the issue is will black politics black uniform support for liberals ever change things wont change until blacks begin to see that these same liberal politics and attitudes are at the root of their problems today

5068711 that this augurs the beginning of a new round of attacks on vladimir putins russia and not only by chechen separatists and other al qaeda affiliated terrorist groups is a prediction hardly fraught with risk a lot of people have it in for holy mother russia as alexander solzhenitsyn pointed out the other day in a rare television interview and the chechens are the least of it

5068724 wij hebben een redelijk goede dekking maar elke klacht wordt serieus bekeken
5068725 soms gaan er maanden overheen voordat een ontvangstprobleem wordt opgelost
5068726 maar over het algemeen vertoont ons netwerk maar weinig gaten

5068731 voor mij was de storing enorm stressvol los van het feit dat ik zelf geen e mail meer had moest ik ook verantwoorden waarom anderen dat niet hadden we moesten voortdurend testen om te zien of het systeem alweer in de lucht was en het ergste was misschien nog wel de stress die werd veroorzaakt door de vraag of ik heb geblunderd door iedereen over te laten stappen op google apps dat is wat me het meest zorgen baarde sta ik door google nu te boek as een idioot
5068732 dat ik ze nu 20 procent lager inschaal komt door de angst voor herhaling maar dan op grotere schaal met meer schade zoiets is nog niet gebeurd maar deze crash heeft aangetoond dat het op ieder moment kan gebeuren zonder enige waarschuwing en als dat gebeurt heb ik geen enkel middel waarmee ik de service weer kan laten draaien

5068761 the uk is totally committed to meeting international obligations and goes further than requirements in many area
5068762 after being chucked into a crazy situation playing a serial killer being recognised with a nomination at such prestigious awards is the icing on the cake
5068763 the nomination is enough but at the end of the day if i took it out of course id be thrilled i am a real fan of the others work so i wont be practising my acceptance speech yet
5068764 it was a great storyline to be a part of it was fun to work with johnny but the crew are the people who should be really recognised at the end of the day
5068765 the shooting crew in the studio and on location were the hardest workers out of all of us
5068766 the fact michael galvin has been recognised finally for all his hard work and fantastic performances over the years is far more important than my nomination in saying that my mum is stoked
5068767 obviously im very delighted but i am wondering what i did this year that i didnt do the other 12
5068768 i love antony starr and erik thompson i think theyre both brilliant actors
5068769 ive known eric since university which is longer ago than either of us would want to admit im honoured to be in their company
5068770 players are ready to go at 3pm and then have to start all over again an hour later it took a while for both teams to get going but the first goal gave us a platform to build on and when kevin lisbie scored the second it gave us some breathing space
5068771 weve been ahead at burnley before and been pegged back so it was important we made ourselves difficult to beat and that is something we have to do for another 22 away games
5068772 we dug in had moments of good play as well and everyone worked their socks off alex bruce was fantastic for us ben thatcher did well on his debut and the two lads in the middle at the back were very solid
5068773 it was a terrific win and it sets us up for wolves next week which will be a big test for us
5068774 i have told the lads if they want to go away and feel sorry for themselves then they are no good to me
5068775 if they are prepared to come in on monday and roll heir sleeves up and do some hard work thats the type we need if they are not up for that then tap on my door because they will not be here we are here to make sure players on that pitch are representative of what i would expect
5068776 again there was plenty of effort but you cannot continue to give goals away like that because it just takes the wind out of everyones sails
5068777 we had total control of that game and in the early part of the match we had several chances to go and win the game as it was we never took them and paid a heavy price by conceding some soft goals we shot ourselves right in the foot and theres no getting away from that
5068778 that had nothing to do with it and at half time if we had come in at 0 0 we would have been pleased because wed been creating opportunities ipswich had two shots at goal if it was two shots and we found ourselves two goals down
5068779 i was looking for that spark in the second half to get the goal but we never got it and their third goal probably summed up the day

5068785 well we used to have insert generic american light lager i cant remember if it was bud light or coors light or maybe miller light but we just ran out

5068789 the wicket seems to have a bit in it for both fast bowlers and spinners a bit of bounce and spin
5068790 who those five bowlers are we havent decided yet we are looking at two spinners harbhajan singh and pragyan ojha you rarely play four fast bowlers in this situation
5068791 you have to take chances against mendis in the sense that you make sure when he bowls a loose delivery you get the most out of it so you put pressure on the bowler as well
5068792 the inputs of sehwag and gambhir will be crucial to the rest who havent played too many deliveries of mendis but it is finally up to the individual

5068798 as an ex league player im loving it and i think all the guys are
5068799 the good thing about south african and new zealand rugby is that kids grow up picking up a ball and running with it i thought today was a great advertisement for the way the games played
5068800 at my age i never dreamed a few years ago that i would still be playing the game for my country
5068801 to me its just a thorough enjoyment i ran out today and the crowd sung the south african anthem and we did the haka it was awesome this is what you dream about
5068802 especially in the second half i thought our tactical kicking really stepped up and we just kept making them come out of their own 22 which is tough
5068803 theres a big improvement there and its become a big part of our game and one of the reasons that got us home
5068804 weve been working on guys looking for space and communicating it the champion that dan is you cant rely on him to make all the calls and i think hes now got good help around him
5068805 they showed tremendous courage and i think thats what won the game their courage and their fitness in the last 20 minutes
5068806 as a coach you feel very proud they had that togetherness
5068807 defence really set the attitude for us and when you make gang tackles it makes it a lot easier to get turnovers at the breakdown
5068808 with 15 to go you could feel we were getting on top of them we were playing in the right part of the field and putting them under pressure in their own half so you could feel the momentum swing our way
5068809 it the aircraft had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5068810 it was approximately two miles from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft
5068811 we believe the light aircraft was also hoping to land at coventry

5068814 records are always made to be broken no matter what they are
5068815 anyone can do anything they want if they really want to
5068816 ive said all along i want to be the first michael phelps not the second mark spitz
5068817 never once will i downplay his accomplishments by any means what he did is still an amazing feat and will always be an amazing feat in the swimming world and the olympics
5068818 to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when you were tired and wanted to go home and sleep and not train it made those days easier and say i want to do this
5068819 its something i wanted to do and im thankful to him spitz for doing what he did
5068820 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5068821 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge
5068822 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them
5068823 church officials said theyd hoped to have some tickets available for the public but ran out when they couldnt satisfy demand among church members who got the first crack at tickets that sold for 500 to 2 000

5068827 regrettably in many cases the emphasis has changed from the desire to provide a needy child with a home to that of providing a needy parent with a child as a result a whole industry has grown generating millions of dollars of revenue each year

5068841 the coroner has been informed but we can give no further details at the moment other than to say he is male and we believe he is local
5068842 he was a loveable lad who was never really in trouble
5068843 someone told me that conor was thought to have said something to someone which he denied
5068844 it all then got out of hand and there was a commotion and he ended up getting stabbed

5068849 the series of interacting ecosystems that compose a single huge ecosystem at the earths surface period
5068850 the surface of the planet behaves as a physiological system in certain limited ways
5068851 auntie evolution has purposefully caused us to be so and so
5068852 the earth is not flat its a ball that spins around itself and were not falling off because of something we call gravity for lack of a better term since we have no clue what the bloody hell it is
5068853 grandmother gaia is angry at you for driving around in a greenhouse gas machine
5068854 you know stassa transsexuality is hereditary and one of your foetuses is transsexual so we have to abort it
5068855 cathy heffernan you have an ear on each side of your head
5068856 ive always wondered how deaf parents attend to a crying child in the middle of the night
5068857 what if the child whose parents have decided she will be deaf considers herself disabled
5068858 the militantly deaf may have convinced themselves that they ar not missing out on anything as a comping mechanism
5068859 but a fully enabled mammal has five senses to be missing one can be a disadvantage
5068860 should we learn tomorrow that say having a cup of tea every day at breakfast would eliminate congenital deafness or blindness or intersex conditions or low functioning autism or downs syndrome or that would be a very happy day indead
5068861 a weird argument on the one hand it seems to argue that disabilities shouldnt be stigmatised but on the other hand by adamantaly sic refusing to accept that deafness is a disability it pretty much stigmatises disability through its own rejection of the label
5068862 what are those things on the side of your head for if not to hear just to balance your glasses the man of the deaf couple was just crazy im not disbled his signer exclaimed on his behalf
5068863 how many hearing children of deaf parents grow up and then think to themselves i really wish i was deaf
5068864 to me this seems like members of a cult trying to forcibly recruti others
5068865 my problem with all this is what happens to the human embryos that are not selected the ones dropped in the bing or flushed down the plughole
5068866 the child will be disabled because it does not have a capability that fully functional humans have your feelings are irrelevant
5068867 incindentally this is why i feel uncomfortable about transexuality surgically removing ones sexual organs deprives one of the capabillity of reproducing
5068868 i thought humphrys was reamarkably restrained for not pointing out that tomato lichy is not aname its a side dish
5068869 people born disabled non functioning ears eyes vocal chords legs etc arguing in the face of all the evidence that they are not and actually attempting to create more people with the same disabilities
5068870 i would agree with others that not being able to hear music or bird song or the sound of your baby crying is a genuine not imaginary loss perhaps what youve never heard you dont miss but thats no reason to stop your children from having it too
5068871 if we were to postulate a planet where hearing was not the norm the woman who wrote the guardian article cathy hefferman would be normal this planet isnt
5068872 cathyif deafness is not a disability then do you campaign to have disability living allowance removed from deaf people because it is unnecessary and patronising cheers
5068873 hearing people are not better than deaf people but being able to hear is vastly preferable to being deaf
5068874 the autism liberationists do actually believe they are superior beings should be good for a column or two
5068875 both sides in this debate would seek to play god i dont have the answers but a little more tolerance understanding of deaf culture would be a god thing
5068876 deafness is deafness detailed knowledge is not required in the face of that brute fact
5068877 okay a deaf embryo is rejected and in return a hearing embryo is selected net loss of babies zero
5068878 this year i found the heat very uncomfortable and that coupled with the fact that i was growing every day the lack of sleep and the desire to just sit on my bum and stuff my face was not conducive to work when i am playing belle i have to play a sexually liberated empowered young prostitute but unfortunately i felt like a sweating sea cow
5068879 i had no food cravings other than wanting food constantly i was thirsty all the time and always needing the toilet which is really unhelpful when working to such a tight schedule
5068880 this is the reason why big colleges were not affected when it comes to the smaller colleges the impact will be a lot bigger and students there will lose out
5068881 so far our placements seem to have gone down to 70 per cent it may catch up to 80 by the end of this season but it will certainly not match last years record
5068882 the fluff in every college the students who may not be among the best will find it impossible to make it this year companies want only the best which is partly why they are all fighting for day one
5068883 we have increased the salary for the this years offers coming in for next year to rs 325 000 from rs 300 000 and in the case of m e m techs the compensation has been increased from rs 325 000 to rs 350 000
5068884 students who would be content with one placement in a tier i company are keeping tier ii and even tier iii as back up this may work against many average students too
5068885 this was the case in all colleges in the state and students who did not keep a back up option suffered there is a lot of anxiety among students this year
5068886 i walked in there and i fell it was dark and i didnt know when i was going to stop
5068887 daniel reneau who coldly murdered kriss keeran in the early morning hours of january 2 1996 has already been executed by the state of texas for this senseless act
5068888 nevertheless on august 21 2008 the state seeks to execute jeffery wood for the same crime even though the state does not contend that mr wood shot keeran in fact mr wood was not even in the building when reneau shot and killed keeran
5068889 bunker despite being a co conspirator without whose agreement and encouragement the crime never would have occurred was never charged with any crime
5068890 bowing to mr woods emotional and irrational insistence mr woods appointed lawyers declined to cross examine any witnesses or present any evidence on mr woods behalf
5068891 mr woods trial attorneys called mr woods actions a gesture of suicide and objected on moral grounds to participating in the arrangement ordered by the trial court effectively as legal vessels assisting mr woods suicidal ends
5068892 despite having a valid license grigson was a medical fraud although mr woods jury did not know it
5068893 in 1995 3 years before he testified in mr woods trial grigson was expelled from the american psychiatric association and the texas society of psychiatric physicians for flagrant ethical violations related to his testimony purporting to predict future dangerousness because he was not cross examined mr woods jury was not aware of this information nor did the state elicit it despite its duty to see that justice is done and to disclose impeachment evidence

5068900 if i go out in public the military will be more than happy to walk with me and tell me to get my butt back to the hotel

5068906 i like his 3 point shots 2 points is ok too
5068907 he has experience and he also plays consistently especially in the crucial moments
5068908 ive been out here several times and the support has always been great but this has been another level
5068909 i dont know how this happened or when this happened
5068910 if i go out in public the military will be more than happy to walk with me and tell me to get my butt back to the hotel

5068920 theyre loving us too we went to the silk market and we got mobbed there we go to tennis swimming whatever its awesome to see the fan support were getting from the chinese and other countries hopefully were doing good job being ambassadors
5068921 what i really wanted to write about was politics because after all i knew how to fix everything but for some reason no one wanted to listen to me
5068922 it was all sort of an immediate success it worked the column in the new york times was suggested to me but id been writing for 20 years by then
5068923 a little rock climbing ability and a head for heights
5068924 he was asleep actually and had they not woken him up he could have been gone in the fire
5068925 to be honest you kind of think about all the bad things that could happen to you
5068926 you dont want to go two thirds of an inning and be all over the place in that aspect im happy i was able to get a win
5068927 i was impressed with how he bounced back from that first inning
5068928 he got through a very tough part of the order in the fifth
5068929 that was a great sign when his pitch count was rising and he was probably tiring he hung in there
5068930 it was kind of strange because with the first hitter you have some anxiety and nerves
5068931 but i got him on two pitches then i started to miss the zone and i had to struggle i think i was trying too hard
5068932 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
5068933 luckily i was able to flare the ball for a hit
5068934 my mechanics are a little off and i have to work on that
5068935 i fell behind too many hitters its frustrating because its usually been one inning
5068936 the widescale opposition to stockholms congestion charge appears to have evaporated according to a new poll carried out by sifo on behalf of the green party 62 of stockholm residents are planning to vote to keep the charge in the autumn referendum opinion has shifted in favour of the charge since the trial has shown it to have a positive effect on traffic levels
5068937 people come to new york citys parks to get away from the hustle and bustle of urban life
5068938 moving traffic off of the park loop roads will significantly reduce health risks for people using the park especially those exercising along the loop roads
5068939 he gets 1 2 extra balls more than any other player
5068940 i feel like i win for the whole country not just for me
5068941 he gets 1 2 extra balls more than any other player
5068942 i feel like i win for the whole country not just for me
5068943 because akshay and i have worked together and given hits in the past he didnt quote his market price for singh is kinng
5068944 any producer will pay him rs 50 60 crore now
5068945 he is a very good looking hero who entered the industry as an action hero at a time when audiences really looked up to that genre
5068946 kumars is not a fresh face in the industry but with each film hes willing to experiment and thats what gives him the edge
5068947 hes an actor who was game to don a turban in his new film how many leading names in indian cinema can actually do that
5068948 he carried off a pink kurta in namaste london it wasnt easy but he did it hes extraordinarily professional and a no nonsense guy
5068949 kumar despite being a top rung actor in films has remained like hrithik roshan in the second rung as far as endorsements go says harish bijoor brand specialist amp ceo harish bijoor consultants adding

5068959 there are successful stories in the muslim community that have not been properly advertised
5068960 right now the moment you say muslims people tend to think these guys are fanatics who are always praying and have beards
5068961 thats wrong because the majority of muslims are not like that
5068962 we have to demolish this image the stereotyping of the muslims who are currently all seen as religious people
5068963 there are successful stories in the muslim community that have not been properly advertised
5068964 you cannot exclude imams and expect all muslim voices to be represented on an advisory body

5068972 some people would enjoy more space they did move a block away from a gigantic park after all

5068982 hellers quest for deeper understanding has led to pioneering breakthroughs in religious concepts and knowledge as well as expanding the horizons of science
5068983 to serve as a philanthropic catalyst for discovery in areas engaging lifes biggest questions
5068984 his unique position as a creatively working scientist and reflective man of religion has brought to science a sense of transcendent mystery and to religion a view of the universe through the broadly open eyes of science
5068985 he has introduced a significant notion of theology of science he has succeeded in showing that religion isolating itself from scientific insights is lame and science failing to acknowledge other ways of understanding is blind
5068986 if we ask about the cause of the universe we should ask about the cause of mathematical laws by doing so we are back in the great blueprint of gods thinking about the universe the question on ultimate causality why is there something rather than nothing
5068987 when asking this question we are not asking about a cause like all other causes we are asking about the root of all possible causes science is but a collective effort of the human mind to read the mind of god from question marks out of which we and the world around us seem to be made

5068992 i put my application in to field this season and i hadnt heard anything back
5068993 when i inquired they first told me i didnt have an application in
5068994 when i pointed out that i had applied they told me it was on the wrong form
5068995 then they told me that management couldnt approve the application and it would have to go to the board
5068996 i think whats confusing them is that ive taken extended leave of absence after the hold up and i didnt field at all last season
5068997 if i had been working for a bank i would be on indefinite stress leave

5069007 the new batman movie and you know what theyre right it really shouldnt be rated 12a its certainly an action packed movie but its too dark too brooding too forbidding for the british board of film censors to grant it a 12a rating right in the middle of the school holidays
5069008 between 2006 2008 at least 15 british nationals have been charged in thailand alone for the sexual abuse of children others have been prosecuted in india ghana vietnam cambodia and albania to name a few many of them have been teachers or volunteers in orphanages
5069009 to state that northern cities like bradford liverpool and my home town of hull have no hope of being regenerated in the 21st century and that people should move to london oxford and cambridge is the most insulting and ignorant policy ive ever heard

5069049 once they get the thrill of live theatre theres no getting rid of it
5069050 the key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder
5069051 over a number of years that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment
5069052 the brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out
5069053 its not going to tell us the whole story it doesnt give you the whole puzzle but its something to build on
5069054 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5069055 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5069056 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5069057 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5069058 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new
5069059 when it comes to voting unemployment doesnt matter inequality doesnt matter in the united states growth of real after tax income does matter the stock market does matter
5069060 people that think that the fed is some kind of political creature are mistaken they do a disservice to assume that and its very unfortunate that some people assume that
5069061 there wont be any reason to change anything at this meeting
5069062 i doubt a second stimulus package is going to happen but its rarely prudent to overestimate the wisdom or fiscal prudence of politicians during an election year
5069063 if its going to happen it must happen in september

5069066 of course the oil price has some effect but the real effect on traffic is the gdp gross domestic product effect
5069067 we believe that what drives traffic in the long term is gdp not oil price
5069068 european mergers are not on the agenda right now after the end of the merger with abertis
5069069 now we are mainly focused on developing our network in italy and expanding our presence elsewhere
5069070 we always try to have conservative and reasonable debt strategies
5069071 our debt to equity ratio is well below the european average and the worldwide average we believe the credit crunch could be even an opportunity for us in the near future because we have higher flexibility
5069072 we were not ready to take huge traffic risks in the long term
5069073 its important to invest in countries where the government has a need for private resources to build and revamp its infrastructure and we tend to select countries where theres long term growth driven by resources or demography
5069074 its a less than 30km section of the moscow to minsk road with a limited investment this is the best test to be capable of analysing and better understanding the opportunities in that market

5069076 after college i worked for a year at an insurance company i decided to go to oxford for a year because well it was oxford i told the other women at work and one said i wish i could just up and go to oxford so i asked why dont you she said i would but i bought a couch i always remembered that moment and i ever wanted to be that woman i never wanted to be trapped by my belongings my past my commitments
5069077 the stereotype is that domineering parents push their kids to succeed killing their childrens love for whatever theyre studying but the opposite was far more common young people who were given too much leeway by parents afraid of being overbearing when their children really needed help in identifying what was important to them
5069078 failures hard but success is far more dangerous if youre successful at the wrong thing the mix of praise and money and opportunity can lock you in forever it is so so much harder to leave a good thing
5069079 you want to know where your fears are hiding tell me what you know about yourself tell me what you cant live without

5069125 companies spend a lot of money to get onto these contract vehicles and if they are not seeing a lot of return on their investments in terms of task orders this could be an avenue that is open to them
5069126 i dont think the protest rules will have that big of an impact because any task order or indefinite delivery indefinite quantity delivery contract vehicle stands by itself as its own degree of competition

5069157 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5069158 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation

5069163 the appraiser said the house was worth 114 500 so why would we sell it for 100 000

5069173 where do you want to go and what is the purpose and length of your trip
5069174 i wasnt worried about the world record i didnt know i set it until i finished my victory lap just to be olympic champion i was happy
5069175 i have a lot more time for that i just want to win
5069176 i just cant stomach the money insurance companies say were forced to pay
5069177 we live in a misconception that the more expensive something is makes it best
5069178 i get excellent care for a fraction of the cost
5069179 id just paid the car off and wasnt in a place to pay 1 000
5069180 but thats the convenient option not the less expensive one
5069181 the shave is 1 50 and even if i give a 2 tip you still cant beat it
5069182 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5069183 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5069184 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5069185 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5069186 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5069187 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5069188 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5069189 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5069190 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5069191 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5069192 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5069193 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5069194 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5069195 in the old days it was expected that about half the children in a family would die before they grew up this involved pain illness and sorrow to the mother often great suffering to the children and
5069196 such a state of affairs will have both merits and demerits more important than either however is the fact that nothing less will enable a society imbued with scientific technique to survive scientific technique demands organization and the more it becomes perfected the larger are the organizations that it demands quite apart from war the present depression has made it evident that an international organization of credit and banking is necessary to the prosperity not only of some countries but of all the international organization of industrial production is being rendered necessary by the efficiency of modern methods modern industrial plants can easily supply in many directions much more than the total needs of the world the result of this which should be wealth is in fact poverty owing to competition in the absence of competition the immensely enhanced productivity of labour would enable men to arrive at a just compromise between leisure and goods they could choose whether they would work six hours a day and be rich or four hours a day and enjoy only moderate comfort the advantages of world wide organization both in preventing the waste of economic competition and in removing the danger of war are so great as to be becoming an essential condition for the survival of societies possessing scientific technique this argument is overwhelming in comparison with all counterarguments and renders almost unimportant the question whether life in an organized world state will be more or less satisfactory than life at the present day for it is only in the direction of an organized world state that the human race can develop unless it abandons scientific technique and it will not do this except as the result of a cataclysm so severe as to lower the whole level of civilization the advantages to be derived from an organized world state are great and obvious there will be in the first place security against war and a saving of almost the whole effort and expense now devoted to competitive armaments there will be one must suppose a single highly efficient fighting machine employing mainly aeroplanes and chemical methods of warfare which will be quite obviously irresistible and will therefore not be resisted the central government may be changed from time to time by a palace revolution but this will only alter the personnel of the figure heads not the essential organization of government the central government will of course forbid the propaganda of nationalism by means of which at present anarchy is maintained and will put in its place a propaganda of loyalty to the world state
5069197 we have seen that scientific civilization demands world wide organization if it is to be stable we have considered the possibility of such an organization in matters of government we shall now consider it in the economic sphere at present production is organized as far as possible nationally be means of tariff walls every nation tries to produce at home as much as possible of the goods that it consumes this tendency is on the increase and even great britain which has hitherto aimed at maximizing its exports by means of free trade appears to be on the point of abandoning this policy in favour of comparative economic isolation it is of course clear that from a purely economic point of view it is wasteful to organize production nationally rather than internationally it would be an economy if all the motor cars used throughout the world were manufactured in detroit that is to say a car of given excellence could be produced with less expense of human labour in that case than it can at present in a world scientifically organized most industrial products would be thus localized there would be one place for making pins and needles another place for making scissors and knives another place for making aeroplanes and yet another for agricultural machinery when if ever the world government that we have considered comes into being one of its first tasks will be the international organization of production production will no longer be left as at present to private enterprise but will be undertaken solely in accordance with government orders this is already the case with such things as battleships because in regard to war efficiency is thought to be important but in most matters production is left to the chaotic impulses of private manufacturers who make too much of some things and too little of others with the result that there is poverty in the midst of unused plenty the industrial plant at present existing in the world is in many directions far in excess of the worlds needs by eliminating competition and concentrating production in a single concern all this waste could be avoided the control of raw materials is a matter which in any scientific society would be governed by a central authority at present the important raw materials are controlled by military power the weak nation possessed of oil soon finds itself under suzerainty of some stronger nation the transvaal lost its independence because it contained gold raw material ought not to belong to those who by conquest or diplomacy have happened to acquire the territory in which they are they ought to belong to a world authority which would ration them to those who had the most skill in utilizing them moreover our present economic system causes everybody to be wasteful of raw materials since there is no motive for foresight in a scientific world the supply of any vital raw material will be carefully estimated and as the moment of its exhaustion approaches scientific research will be directed to the discovery of a substitute agriculture for reasons which we considered in an earlier chapter may have less importance in the future than it has at present and has had in the past we shall have not only artificial silk but artificial wool and artificial timber and artificial rubber in time we may have artificial food but in the meantime agriculture will become more and more industrialized both in its methods and in the mentality of those who practise it american and canadian agriculturists have already the industrial mentality not the mentality of the patient peasant machinery will of course be increasingly employed in the neighbourhood of large urban markets intensive cultivation with artificial methods of warming the soil will yield many crops every year here and there throughout the country side there will be large power stations forming the nucleus around which the population will cluster of agricultural mentality as it has been known since ancient times nothing will survive since the soil and even the climate will be subject to human control
5069198 the gain from an economic point of view will be enormous there will be no waste in competitive production no uncertainty as to employment no poverty no sudden alternations of good and bad times every man willing to work will be kept in comfort and every man unwilling to work will be kept in prison when owing to any circumstances the work upon which a man has hitherto been employed is no longer required he will be taught some new kind of work and will be adequately maintained while he is learning his new trade economic motives will be employed to regulate population which will probably be kept stationary almost all that is tragic in human life will be eliminated and even death will seldom come before old age
5069199 it may be assumed that every man and woman will be obliged to work and will be taught a new trade if for any reason work at the old trade is no longer required the pleasantest work of course will be that which gives the most control over the mechanism the posts giving most power will presumably be awarded to the ablest men as a result of intelligence tests for entirely inferior work negroes will be employed wherever possible one may i suppose assume that the most desirable kinds of work will be more highly paid than the less desirable kinds since they require more skill the society will not be one in which there is equality although i doubt whether the inequalities will be hereditary except as between different races i e between white and coloured labour everybody will be comfortable and those who occupy the better paid posts will be able to enjoy considerable luxury there will not be as at present fluctuations of good and bad times for these are merely the result of our anarchic economic system nobody will starve and nobody will suffer the economic anxieties which at present beset rich and poor alike on the other hand life will be destitute of adventure except for the most highly paid experts ever since civilization began men have been seeking security more avidly than they have sough anything else in such a world they will have it but i am not quite sure whether they will think it worth the price that they will have paid for it
5069200 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement

5069229 to develop an effective approach to informing young women about this risk factor for breast cancer we need a better understanding of young women
5069230 as part of a study funded by the canadian breast cancer research alliance we are consulting young women age 15 to 24 from across the country on this topic to do this we have been conducting focus groups and are implementing an online survey to reach other women
5069231 the locations were chosen because of the provinces different smoking rates b c has the lowest provincial prevalence rate for smoking 15 per cent with new brunswick among the provinces with the highest rates 22 per cent the web based survey is intended to build on the knowledge gathered through focus groups by reaching out to a wider audience of young women the results of the survey will be used to prepare for a larger national study
5069232 the beetle has a one year life cycle so you wont be able to tell that theres been damage most of the trees that are being attacked right for up to 9 12 months
5069233 sometimes after the tree has been compromised woodpeckers will come in and strip the bark off its then you start to see trees turning yellow and red
5069234 the beetles are carried by the wind but they also fly most of the bug infestations are on the westside in the lodge pole pine populations at high elevations i expect thats where theyre coming from
5069235 a lot is dependent on weather i think a lot of the beetles would prefer to stay up in the high elevation forests where there is a lot of food the unpredictable factor is how quickly they will build up in the city
5069236 its pretty much run its course in the north and central interior sometime over the next five years we expect the beetles will have run out of food theyll either be dispersed into new areas or just die out he says b c experienced a pine beetle infestation in the early 1900s paula findlay of edmonton won the female junior elite matt vierula of ottawa was the male winner photo contributed by contributed story 41197 aug 16 2008 8 29 pm paula findlay of edmonton repeated her 2007 performance by winning the female junior elite category in the 2008 canadian national triathlon championships in the pushor mitchell apple triathlon in kelowna despite temperatures exceeding 35 c on the day paula improved her time of last year in 58 07 matt vierula of ottawa was the male winner and finished the 750m swim 20km cycle and 5km run in 54 53 competition was very strong in the male category with matt sharpe of victoria in second place in 54 57 third place went to cole stewart of langley in 55 08 one of saturdays competitors at the finish line photo rachael kimola apple try a tri results by contributed story 41196 kelowna and westbank first time triathletes competed in the pushor mitchell kelowna apple triathlon saturday completing the try a tri 300 m swim 15 km bike 3 km run in good spirit and sunny weather results were females 1st 49 33 laura ransom kelowna 2nd 50 03 jodi walsh westbank 3rd 53 28 anna page lumby males 1st 50 04 jared verstaete kelowna 2nd 50 08 aaron wells westbank 3rd 50 54 jim faulkner enderby the kids of steel showed determination and endurance in the 500 m swim 15 km bike and 4 km run in the age group 8 9 years desirae ridenour of cowichan finished first in 21 58 with jordan hopkins of victoria winning the boys 8 9 in 23 13 age group 10 11 was won by cordell dickie of kelowna in 31 30 and courtney chanin of queen charlotte winning the girls in 33 42 spencer burns of powell river 44 40 was the winner in the boys 12 13 section and robynne shannon of vancouver in the girls in 44 44 winner for boys 14 15 was riley maccharles in 47 00 and gabrielle edwards of saskatoon in girls 52 21 the 16 19 age group race of 750 m swim 20 km bike and a 5 km run was won by fraser cashion of port coquitlam in 1 03 39 and allegra rogers of westbank was first female in with 1 11 35 results of the junior elite races will be made available soon with temperatures of mid 30s expected sunday the age group sprint elite and olympic distance races are expected to be very tough by rcmp story 41195 aug 16 2008 7 20 pm rcmp are looking for a suspect after a early morning rape in kelownas downtown core police say that a lone female was walking near the 1400 block of richter street at approximately 2 00 am saturday she was approached by an unknown male and after a brief conversation was attacked and assaulted the male suspect is described as follows caucasian male approx age between 21 25 years of age approx height 5 6

5069250 we dont need those threats already we are already going to be put inside of cages for doing nothing more than exercising our constitutional rights
5069251 typically you would have participants from both sides that would be arrested

5069262 its hard for me to work on it because you dont want to hurt guys in practice just playin
5069263 seriously weve been working on it youll be able to see it in a couple of weeks
5069264 i love to hit especially when all ive got to do is run at somebody thats fun thats just fun
5069265 theres a lot more hard hitting and a lot more concentration
5069266 you can see a difference between early in the year when they would lose focus or miss an assignment that doesnt happen as much any more
5069267 all i know is weve got a bunch of athletic guys back there who are going to be ready to go out and hit somebody when aug 30 comes
5069268 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
5069269 the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points
5069270 it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas
5069271 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard
5069272 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
5069273 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
5069274 we ran our two minute offense the entire game in stephenville
5069275 ive gotten so accustomed to calling the no huddle hurry up spread offense it would seem slow and mundane to call any other style
5069276 on the flip side it might have been the best thing for my career
5069277 i remember running play after play after play in the first practice after i got home i went to bed and slept half the day
5069278 in our offense last year we might have five seconds left on the clock when wed run a play
5069279 this year we probably wont even use five seconds before we run the next play
5069280 anything less than another state title would be a disappointment

5069285 we understand why theyre doing it because they have an opportunity to make a large part of their athletic department budget

5069287 i dont have a crystal ball to see how its going to change
5069288 it means were always going to have a i aa team on the schedule because you can get them for 300 000
5069289 everybody is doing it and fiscally weve got to do it as well
5069290 we did it with sam houston state two years ago because we were really in a bind for that 12th game
5069291 but philosophically we said were not going to do that again

5069651 familia cultura deporte no es un lema es acci n
5069652 pienso en un club con futbol a la sudamericana y organizaci n europea

5069654 los socios de river me dir n si me ven como una opci n importante para eso lo que hago d a a d a es prepararme y no es f cil me lleva la vida
5069655 pero lo creo posible y creer posible algo es hacerlo cierto
5069656 obviamente estamos dolidos por la derrota y la situaci n y bueno estamos con la mejor cara para revertir esto si te pones a ver qui n mereci creo que merecimos m s es futbol no es pretexto pero tenemos que analizar qu es lo que pasa porque ya son tres partidos sin ganar y nosotros somos los m s preocupados hicimos un partido muy bueno en cuanto al funcionamiento pero el resultado no lo refleja obviamente tenemos que analizar y poner m s dentro de la cancha
5069657 creo que los m s preocupados somos nosotros en este momento lo que venga de parte del cuerpo t cnico y directiva se suman a la preocupaci n que nosotros tenemos estamos muy comprometidos con el cuerpo t cnico instituci n y con la afici n y vamos a poner la cara para salir de esto hay que hacer un an lisis personal cada quien hay que tratar de mejorar reci n va iniciando el torneo pero tenemos mucho por delante

5069661 las alemanas tienen un conjunto muy fuerte y muy dif cil de ser batido
5069662 estamos dando m s nfasis a la parte del acierto en los pases a la parte del conjunto del equipo para que la gente llegue y pueda trabajar bien y crear espacios
5069663 en brasil trabajamos siempre todos los puntos tanto en lo defensivo como en lo ofensivo y en la parte del centro del campo en la finalizaci n el pase del bal n la intensidad del juego todo lo necesario para que el equipo pueda conseguir esa victoria
5069664 nosotras necesitamos 120 minutos para conseguir el pase a semifinales mientras que brasil lo obtuvo en 90 estamos en un buen momento y ser un partido en el que la jugadoras deber n mostrar mucha voluntad para poder imponernos
5069665 cualquier detalle har la diferencia quiz s la suerte el desgaste o el cansancio

5069669 deben de darle el lugar a los jugadores por su esfuerzo
5069670 salinas es un jugador nuevo es su primer partido y tienen que comprender que un jugador nuevo no tira una barrida o una plancha con mala intenci n

5069672 yo sigo contento con mi equipo mientras estuvo completo luch bien ofreci buen partido y propuso el juego ofensivo que nos estaba haciendo falta ya con diez y en esta cancha es muy dif cil aguantar por tanto tiempo

5069682 president medvedev agreed but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks
5069683 assured that georgians will not continue to use military force
5069684 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5069685 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like

5069687 i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not

5069700 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5069701 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block
5069702 while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on the 29th of march 2008

5069763 i know its been slow this is important to us
5069764 part of the hurdles weve had to overcome have been with state permitting
5069765 we have to borrow 15 million to 18 million to complete phases i and ii
5069766 if all goes well well be able to start digging the foundation some time this school year
5069767 we wondered if the building was going to fall in on us
5069768 that was kind of scary because weve had hurricanes here with winds recorded at 130 miles per hour
5069769 we are working through the site plan items with escambia county and its our desire to begin demolition in early 2009

5069772 childrens children are a crown to the aged and parents are the pride of their children
5069773 i dont think you can control the entire world from one centre
5069774 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5069775 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus and afghanistan
5069776 iran is definitely having some influence on these issues so we are talking
5069777 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5069778 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5069779 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5069780 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5069781 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5069782 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5069783 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5069784 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5069785 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5069786 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5069787 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5069788 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5069789 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5069790 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5069791 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5069792 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5069793 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5069794 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5069795 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5069796 the marijuana users had pi values that were somewhat higher than those of people with chronic high blood pressure and diabetes
5069797 this suggests that marijuana use leads to abnormalities in the small blood vessels in the brain
5069798 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5069799 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5069800 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
5069801 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
5069802 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
5069803 for the first time in 25 years im sending out resumes and going on job interviews
5069804 it wasnt a big deal when i was 19 but its not something im used to doing at my age
5069805 we got no severance pay and everybody ive talked to is still waiting for their paychecks
5069806 ive also been told were not getting cobra extended medical insurance
5069807 right now im dropping off resumes and i have about 30 out there
5069808 ive also applied for unemployment compensation and food stamps but i havent received anything yet it takes weeks to process it and theres a bunch of paperwork
5069809 right now were noticing quite an increase in the number of people were serving overall the centers success rate finding jobs for local applicants is about one in three
5069810 be flexible about the type of job you will accept
5069811 or consider going back to school or retraining for a different field
5069812 i had gone from hostess to server to bartender to manager very fast
5069813 and i loved being a manager but i think my lack of experience as a manager is holding me back a bit
5069814 i wake up in the morning realizing ive got to get out there ive got to find a job and put food on the table
5069815 weve had a lot of new people come in here for assistance in the past few months
5069816 a lot of construction industry people out of work carpenters painters and small business owners selling off their equipment and applying for help
5069817 but the reality of it is you must make enough money to get your message out there and keep it out there
5069818 we get tired of people who are anti business we try to find pro business candidates of any party thats who we like to contribute to
5069819 sometimes theyre better off if i dont give them anything said businessman and real estate developer john carr of pensacola who has donated more than 9 500 to a variety of candidates since august 2005 including more than 2 500 this election cycle
5069820 we only do it because we want to see a change in our politics and better governments period
5069821 my gosh a group of developers retailers bankers or whatever the cast might be will contribute to a campaign and their opponent will try to take advantage of it
5069822 i think its a total misnomer to think that people who have been working in this community and care about this community are trying to get people to vote their way on a particular project
5069823 if theres any conflict we talk about it but were close to the same philosophy on government
5069824 it doesnt matter if its a person i like it just depends on the job we think theyll do
5069825 most candidates who run for office have the unpleasant duty to raise the money
5069826 they try to set up systems to ask friends and others to help because they have to have it
5069827 most of them will call and make an appointment just like they do with the news journal editorial board
5069828 they usually do it about the time they declare for office
5069829 i dread getting a call from my daughter telling me she has missed the bus
5069830 but i think its going to be fine and shes excited about starting school
5069831 the food service fund is self supporting we pay all our direct costs
5069832 i dont believe any community member wants to walk into a school or school sponsored event and see students pushing the limits with boxers being shown or exposing too much
5069833 it is an educational setting we want everyone to take pride in that environment
5069834 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5069835 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles 225 000km a year
5069836 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
5069837 the effect ill tell you what the effect is its pissing me off
5069838 eres rico si ganas m s de 250 000 d lares al a o todos debemos entender que la educaci n las carreteras los servicios no son gratis todos debemos arrimar el hombro
5069839 para m toda persona que tiene un trabajo una casa que puede dar una educaci n a sus hijos y les puede ayudar a mejorar en la vida para mi esa persona es rica y yo no les quiero subir los impuestos a estas familias yo no le quiero subir los impuestos a nadie
5069840 durante mi juventud experimente con drogas beb hice todo eso porque solo pensaba en m mismo por mi incapacidad en centrarme en los dem s
5069841 soy una persona muy imperfecta pero creo que aquello fue mi mayor fallo moral
5069842 i am going to georgia this weekend to get the facts first hand and to show my support for georgias people and its democratically elected government
5069843 i look forward to reporting to my colleagues in the senate and on the foreign relations committee as well as the bush administration about what i learn
5069844 vine a ganar tres medallas ahora me concentrar en los 200 metros y tambi n espero ganar el relevo para darle m s orgullo a mi pa s
5069845 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5069846 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5069847 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5069848 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5069849 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5069850 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5069851 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5069852 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5069853 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5069854 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months
5069855 im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5069856 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5069857 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person
5069858 nothing in this act subjects the pregnant woman upon whom any abortion is performed or attempted to any criminal conviction or penalty for an unlawful abortion
5069859 what should the penalty be for a woman who has an illegal abortion
5069860 the inference is we havent thought through this very well
5069861 jpc 2056 has the potential to replace the standard treatment of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine taken by mouth is easily absorbed bioavailable and relatively nontoxic in tissue culture and in mice it was rapidly effective markedly reducing numbers of parasites within just a few days
5069862 physicians want to think its the medicine and not their enthusiasm about a particular drug that makes a drug more therapeutically effective but now we really have to worry about the nuances of interaction between patients and physicians
5069863 at the very least doctors should be able to use their enthusiasm for a medication as part of the therapy they have a huge potential to use these quality cues to be more effective
5069864 it requires a great deal of faith for a man to be cured by his own placebos
5069865 your thoughts are like the seeds you plant in your garden your beliefs are like the soil in which you plant these seeds
5069866 words are the children of reason and therefore cant explain it they really cant translate feeling because theyre not part of it thats why it bugs me when people try to analyze jazz as an intellectual theorem its not its feeling
5069867 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man born be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born again when he is old can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man born of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it comes and where it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit
5069868 i saw few die of hunger of eating a hundred thousand
5069869 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it

5069900 when you are sitting in a cellar under fire it makes no difference to you who is bombing you you have no idea mainly people were hoping that the russians would come and get us out we just wanted to survive
5069901 the georgians started it but then ours began bombing too
5069902 we were two and half days in the bunker without food by the end there were more than 100 people in the bunker with us dead people lay there it was a living hell
5069903 we had to fight there was no other way to defend ourselves
5069904 many of my friends died they were hitting us with grad rockets from the hills it was like fighting against a shadow
5069905 they were shelling us from all sides and this was the response
5069906 why did saakashvili do this why did they bomb my city just because i am ossetian they promised us they would not fire and then they attacked the city
5069907 we are sometimes finding whole families in basements all thats left of them is bones their families cant recognise them
5069908 im looking forward to having more races as is planned for the future and i wouldnt mind missing one or two tests
5069909 actually the tests have been reduced quite a lot over the last two or three years but i hope we have more races because there is not one that i dont like
5069910 im looking forward to going to india and the other interesting new places currently being discussed
5069911 i think its a pity that we dont race in america any more because for me formula 1 being a world championship should race everywhere in the world setanta readers comment of the day

5069913 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5069914 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block
5069915 while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on the 29th of march 2008
5069916 i tell you the truth no one can see the kingdom of god unless he is born again
5069917 ok if being born again getting saved becoming a christian gets you into the kingdom of god then what does that look like what will a christian in the kingdom of god look like
5069918 we have succeeded in upgrading the capabilities of our planes and have increased the range of these planes to 3000km without refuelling
5069919 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5069920 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5069921 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
5069922 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage

5069926 dun you have caller id thats where i am now air head be here by tomorrow
5069927 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
5069928 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
5069929 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
5069930 i dont know why i went ahead with it i didnt love shafiq and i didnt really want him i was just stupid and naive
5069931 shafiq was in scotland on a six month visa but had over stayed for three years last june he was stopped for driving without a license following which the authorities discovered that he was staying illegally
5069932 i first met him at his uncles house in glasgow and we were together for a few weeks but he was seeing someone else and we broke up before he was taken to dungavel he phoned me from there last july and proposed i was drunk and agreed to go to pakistan and marry him his uncle farooq arranged everything
5069933 in the time i knew shafiq i only had sex with him once on our wedding night then he arranged for me to have my contraceptive implant removed at a private hospital
5069934 i felt pressured into doing that but i agreed in pakistan the women do what the men say we never had sex again i didnt want to be 17 and pregnant
5069935 i am pretty sure that if you will be quite honest you will admit that a good rousing sneeze one that tears open your collar and throws your hair into your eyes is really one of lifes sensational pleasures
5069936 the nose is for breathing the mouth is for eating
5069937 warmth moisture food these are the causes that activate latent germs and arouse them to activity they exist all except the food in the mouth nose and throat at all times the food is thrown out into these as excretions in disease the germs feed on the excretions they are scavengers they were never anything else and will never be anything else they break up and consume the discharge from the tissues this is the function ascribed to germs everywhere in nature outside the body and is their real and only function in disease they are purifying and beneficial agents the medical profession has worked itself into hysteria over the germ theory and is using it to exploit an all too credulous public germs are ubiquitous they are in the air we breathe the food we eat the water we drink we cannot escape them we can destroy them only to a limited extent it is folly to attempt to escape disease by attempting to destroy or escape germs once they are in the body the physician has no means of destroying them that will not at the same time destroy the patient we cannot avoid germs we must be proof against them we have to accept them as one of the joys of life
5069938 the flame of christian ethics is still our highest guide
5069939 fatalism whose solving word in all crises of behavior is
5069940 to live lightheartedly but not recklessly to be gay without being boisterous to be courageous without being bold to show trust and cheerful resignation without fatalism this is the art of living
5069941 custom has furnished the only basis which ethics have ever had

5069945 alguien dijo una vez que en el momento en que te paras a pensar si quieres a alguien ya has dejado de quererle para siempre
5069946 heres what it all boils down to does this unit really make a noticeable improvement in call quality and signal strength in a word absolutely
5069947 to be honest the calls were as clear as we had ever heard from a cellphone
5069948 our only real beef with the airave is the monthly fees
5069949 calls connected quickly and voice quality was great when using the airave simply put it works as advertised
5069950 so if your building has poor sprint coverage you can pay sprint to fix the problem that might prove perhaps a bit difficult to swallow for some people
5069951 technically we think youll love the airave its just those monthly fees that might take off some of the shine
5069952 one of the touted features of the airave was the ability to restrict the users so that in an apartment complex only those authorized could use it as it stands those who are not authorized can connect as well but they cannot make calls and are greeted by a prompt that says that they are on a private network and need to disconnect the only way to disconnect is to go to roaming only or leave the area of the airave 911 service does appear to still work in this situation
5069953 were congress we dont do empirical evidence congress are not huge fans of basing laws on what actually happens but on what will generate the best headlines
5069954 i have not seen a personality apart from a brain therefore hell does not exist
5069955 some people including christians have scared people with bringing up hell therefore hell does not exist
5069956 firstly i am not saying that i know they did im saying that they had a good motivation so there are grounds to think that they may have lied either through flat out deciet its okay to lie if it brings people to jesus or opportunistically accepting something that they heard as truth without requiring evidence because it was convienient for the cause
5069957 however it is notable that even the christian biblical scholars will concede that the gospels were not written until some years after the death and alleged ressurection of christ how many years well thats uncertain we can be sure that the gospels were written after the death of christ
5069958 now after the death and alleged ressurection of christ we have a young christianity thats looking to grow in numbers through conversion they have a motivation to convert people to their religion and the nature of the new testament gospels reflects this very clearly
5069959 im sure this is what jesus meant i mean it makes more sense this way now and its just so useful he must have forseen the need so the need proves the truth of the matter therefore its true
5069960 if i just rape one choir boy in my care and repent sincerely afterwards god will forgive me and ill stay out of hell just once wont hurt
5069961 who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb
5069962 you are to say his disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep 14i if this report gets to the governor we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble
5069963 it is against the law to put this into the treasury since it is blood money
5069964 with the reward he got for his wickedness judas bought a field there he fell headlong his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out everyone in jerusalem heard about this so they called that field in their language akeldama that is field of blood
5069965 first it should be noted that judas fell headlong so an explanation is needed as to why judas body rotated 180 degrees upon the rope breaking judas could have hung himself from a tree branch that protruded over a cliff in order to all the fall sufficient distance so that his body could flip but that seems odd as it would not have contributed to the hanging unless judas meant for the rope to break in fact it would have made it needlessly difficult as judas would have had to climb out onto the protruding branch it could be that as judas fell he crashed into something such as another tree branch that caused his body to flip this is possible but it would make more sense for judas to simply choose the lowest branch that he could find that was sufficiently high a branch with a branch underneath it would have only gotten in the way
5069966 who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb
5069967 mary magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance
5069968 but when they looked up they saw that the stone which was very large had been rolled away
5069969 yes the bible contains some contradictions but although the words may be corrupted i still accept that the message is the word of god
5069970 behold hanameel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying buy thee my field that is in anathoth for the right of redemption is thine to buy it so hanameel mine uncles son came and said unto me buy my field i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the country of benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption is thine buy it for thyself then i knew that this was the word of the lord and i bought the field of hanameel my uncles son that was in anathoth and weighed him the money even seventeen shekels of silver
5069971 and i said unto them if ye think good give me my price and if not forbear so they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver and the lord said unto me cast it unto the potter a goodly price that i was prised at of them and i took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the lord
