550210 i learned a lot in college from my experience and i learned a lot about myself
550211 i grew up a lot in that situation ive learned i have a hard head i dont let things sink in and get to me i just stay calm and do what i can do when theres things out of your reach that you cant control why worry about it just worry about yourself
550212 if i worry about stuff like that then im not going to be able to perform the best i can
550213 right now im a rookie you have to start somewhere and in order for me to achieve my goal of becoming a longtime quarterback in the nfl i cant worry about things i have to try to progress myself as a quarterback and try to get better each practice because i believe my best football is in front of me so you cant worry about things
550214 yeah thats obviously a job i want to hold on to
550215 but right now im just trying to get better and hopefully impress the coaches
550216 its going to be a lot of fun i just cant wait to get out there and see what it feels like
550217 the conventional wisdom is that the newspaper business is a dying business
550218 its not a group of four different people who have had little or nothing to do with each other coming together
550219 we have to make this acquisition and we have to get comfortable with it and then well tackle the operational issues
550220 theres not one ounce of me that believes that newspapers are a thing of the past and are going away
550221 i dont believe it intuitively and i dont believe it based on the reactions of the public to the things we write about photograph and print
550222 certainly have an interest for me given my perspective and my background
550223 but i think hes restricted from saying too much under the terms of the agreement
550224 were well aware of what has been reported in the papers in the past and some of the crises and issues hes had to deal with but theres always another side to the story
550225 the model thats in place now makes it very difficult to sustain a successful operation
550226 this is going to be a partnership where we are going to be looking for some changes
550227 this industry and this newspaper need to come up with game changing ideas
550228 we have always felt that local investors working in partnership with employees who have an ownership stake would be the best way to ensure the future of the newspaper in these challenging times
550229 the purchase and sale agreement is not definite by any means
550230 so we have to move forward under the assumption that the blethen family will own the newspaper indefinitely
550231 to no longer play for time but give us a usable answer to our offers stop dallying
550232 it would be negligent not to use the current opportunity
550233 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to
550234 sen obama says he wants energy independence but he doesnt support anything that serves that goal
550235 he believes every domestic energy source has a problem i believe every energy source needs to be part of the solution
550236 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think theyre cynical
550237 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks and planting doubts about people
550238 my name is hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am
550239 if i was presumptuous or taking this for granted i wouldnt be working this hard this week im beat
550240 weve got to make sure that the money thats going into nasa for basic research and development continues to go there
550241 government is too big and he wants to grow it taxes are too high and he wants to raise them congress spends too much and he proposes more were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit
550242 with an agenda like that a knack for rhetoric comes in mighty handy

550267 the word is going to get out on vashon about which kids did this and obviously wed like anyone who hears about it to call us
550268 this is the type of thing that reeks of kids out there with too much time on their hands and getting into trouble that doesnt make it any less serious
550269 its upsetting its a little bit scary to know that people like that are out there
550270 its tremendously shocking different faith communities have always gotten along very well on the island we hope that its an isolated incident

550280 well i care very much about being involved in the church serving the body equipping the next generation helping younger christians grow in their walk with the lord and im serious about meeting missionary needs something just feels right when theres a lack of resources somewhere and i can help meet that need
550281 no those are the things that you do that are important to you im asking what are you passionate about what excites you some guys are passionate about their car they talk about it all the time and it excites them some guys are passionate about their girlfriend they keep talking about her and their face lights up when they think about them
550282 oh in that sense then id say im passionate about the greatness and glory of god i want to experience behold and enjoy him more all the time and i want to help others see how amazing he is that they might be captivated too and be completely sold out for him nothing excites me more than worship and being exhilarated at our great god when i grasp great truths about him
550283 there you go now when you talk with other people how do you drive them towards your passion
550284 i usually ask what cool things theyve read recently that have more opened their eyes to god or anything really eye catching that theyve read in their devotions or if theyve been experiencing anything lately that have inclined their hearts more towards god and helped them love him more things like that sorta
550285 thats good i encourage you to really think about what kind of questions you can ask people to help them in this area and direct them towards god like for me people know what theyre going to get when they talk to me theyre going to get asked how their quiet times are they know im going to talk to them about evangelism and discipleship too what can you be known for what will people know theyll get when they talk to you
550286 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
550287 alienates anglicans from the orthodox church and contributes to further division of the christian world
550288 such a practice contradicts centuries old church traditions dating back to the first christian community orthodox christians consider women bishops to be even more unacceptable
550289 special blessing to lead the people of god and a special responsibility to maintain the purity of the faith and be symbols and guarantors of the churchs unity
550290 in our view the decision of the general synod of the church of england
550291 not dictated by theological or practical church needs but by a tendency to follow the secular idea of sexual equality in all spheres of life
550292 the ordination of women to the episcopate effectively and definitively blocks a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church

550303 no the momma pig is already in her farrowing crate
550304 no shes not thats what i was helping daddy do
550305 well then did she get out of her farrowing crate because i know she was in it and i saw the 14 piglets in it with her
550306 daddy and i put the other momma pig into her farrowing crate today because shes going to have her babies anyday now too
550307 daddy didnt tell me not to say anything but i think maybe i shouldnt have
550308 educations purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one
550309 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
550310 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
550311 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
550312 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
550313 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
550314 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
550315 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
550316 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
550317 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
550318 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
550319 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
550320 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
550321 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
550322 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
550323 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
550324 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
550325 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
550326 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
550327 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
550328 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
550329 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
550330 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
550331 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
550332 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
550333 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
550334 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
550335 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
550336 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
550337 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
550338 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
550339 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
550340 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
550341 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
550342 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
550343 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
550344 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
550345 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
550346 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
550347 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
550348 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
550349 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream

550351 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
550352 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
550353 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
550354 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
550355 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
550356 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
550357 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
550358 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
550359 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
550360 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
550361 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
550362 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
550363 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
550364 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
550365 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
550366 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
550367 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
550368 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

550370 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
550371 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
550372 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

550439 nos fue muy bien tuve noches con la sala llena y otras con tres cuartas partes y eso en estos tiempos es bueno en la isla nos fue mejor son reas v rgenes y la gente va al teatro en aguada pude ver el teatro lleno y son casi 800 butacas y en manat tambi n y son casi 600 el mes de junio es bueno y las primeras dos semanas de julio despu s hay mucho feriado junto y la gente viaja
550440 el p blico quiere ver teatro bien hecho y con buenos actores
550441 lo que presentamos fue una comedia fina sin ofensas y el p blico respondi
550442 esta ha sido mi mejor edici n en t rminos art sticos y de p blico
550443 normalmente los jueves abr a con 20 personas en sala y este a o no hubo menos de 125 eso adem s de viernes s bado y domingo que se llen es delicioso regresar a la tradici n de ir al teatro desde el jueves no hubo una sola obra que perdiera dinero
550444 la gente espera este festival y no s lo los homosexuales porque ya viene un p blico bien diverso
550445 para ser verano y una sala que est despegando me fue superbien
550446 los nenes est n en campamentos en la semana pero y en el fin de semana qu hay para ellos
550447 creo que era la obra m s econ mica del festival tuvimos unas cien personas por funci n lo que est bien es un precio razonable porque los nenes no van solos y puede ser fuerte pagar m s de eso por persona hice dos funciones s bado y una domingo porque el viernes por la noche no vale la pena los pap s salen tarde del trabajo y los nenes ya est n cansados
550448 a nosotros nos fue mejor de lo que esper bamos considerando que era el ltimo fin de semana de junio y la gente se dispersa hacia la playa viajan y no leen los peri dicos no perdimos y pudimos cubrir los gastos
550449 la planta baja estuvo llena o tres cuartas partes llena hicimos dos funciones s bado y una domingo la obra gusta mucho queremos seguir la tradici n de presentar trabajos infantiles en el verano
550450 se hicieron los tres sketches regulares con temas y lenguaje bien dirigido al verano le a adimos valores a la producci n m s canciones baile vestuario y otras luces quer amos que el espect culo le devolviera a la gente el asunto teatral fueron esperando lo mismo y les dimos m s pero a la gente lo que le gusta son los muchachos y parece que aunque sea en un chinchorro les va a gustar el trabajo
550451 las consideraciones de asistencia son otras cuando la oferta es gratuita pero nos fue bien
550452 la mayor a de las funciones estuvieron llenas fue estupendo
550453 lo m s que respaldan es la comedia y saber que se presentar n artistas profesionales que conocen de la televisi n eso todav a atrae en algunos pueblos de la isla no hubo preferencia de d as empez bamos a veces mi rcoles y se llenaba igual que fin de semana en algunos sitios no hab a m s ninguna oferta de entretenimiento la comedia atrae un p blico m s popular y a los dramas tambi n fue un p blico culto acostumbrado a ir al teatro
550454 los estudiantes universitarios y los acad micos que en verano regresaban a sus casas
550455 what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
550456 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
550457 la familia hilles se ha convertido en una fuerza militar y miembros de la familia han estado atacando secuestrando e incluso matando a otras personas
550458 per un consorzio che si chiama cos sottolineano fonti riservate di palazzo chigi per spiegare lapparente contraddizione non potevamo fare altrimenti
550459 if coke doesnt touch it its a possible double play
550460 it looked like basak may have had a shot but instinct for a pitcher is to stick his glove out and try to make a play and then scott stricklands been lights out for us
550461 i think youve got to give hansack a lot of credit
550462 nobody was really taxed we had three guys starter billy traber steven jackson and mark melancon go two innings but well look at it tonight and sunday morning and see whos available for this afternoons game
550463 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
550464 it may be a way for him to gain favor during the election and tube it later because all the contingencies werent met
550465 i just stopped talking about it because it became a distraction
550466 i panicked because the children need a special diet of porridge which had to be prepared early
550467 it has not rained all winter so we are forced to live on very little water
550468 the situation is very bad we are at the mercy of the environment and if the drought continues for a fifth consecutive year then the effects of the lack of rainfall will be extremely severe
550469 the government has reduced the water flow to households so we only have water three times a week but other tourist places with golf courses are operating as if nothing has happened
550470 now we think twice about using water for such things as washing our cars or cleaning our front porch
550471 we predict that 90 to 95 per cent of the total domestic water supply of cyprus will be met by desalination plants in the next few years
550472 desalination is not the most ideal choice because it uses up a lot of energy and causes greenhouse gas but we clearly have no other option
550473 what we are seeing in cyprus and the rest of the mediterranean is extreme weather conditions and drought is one of them
550474 it is not just that we do not have enough rainfall to fill up our dams and rivers for irrigation but we are also seeing a 70 per cent reduction in the replenishment of the aquifer and this has had a catastrophic affect on agriculture
550475 the government does not provide us with water to grow our crops so we are forced to pump our own water from the ground which is costly the end result is that there are fewer farmers now than before
550476 we knew of the problems and we should have taken measures earlier but we were hoping that it would have rained
550477 i have played him three times now and every time i have broken him
550478 i broke him four times today three times at indian wells
550479 hes obviously got a great serve but i have read it well in the past
550480 the car was behind my lorry and i did not even know that i had grazed their vehicle as the vehicle i was driving was very big
550481 whatever the old man upstairs and i decide that day
550482 to talk to god in your own tongue without pre prepared words like you would a friend how
550483 im going to eat the pepperoni but life and death is yours and yours alone this i know tomorrow is a day for that particular practice

550487 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
550488 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
550489 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
550490 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
550491 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
550492 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
550493 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
550494 you bet youre life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
550495 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
550496 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
550497 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
550498 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
550499 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
550500 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
550501 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players lambert ham bobby bell and many others
550502 the creative license giving yourself permission to be the artist you truly are
550503 the war on art break through the blocks and win your inner creative battles
550504 la crisis ha hecho que el nivel de inscripciones haya bajado un poco pero se mantiene a buen ritmo
550505 estoy muy feliz porque he estado luchando mucho durante estos tres a os para conseguir esto
550506 era feliz como n mero dos pero el n mero uno era una meta
550507 a rafa se le ve a desde el principio que ten a el f sico y la calidad para llegar arriba
550508 el resto estar entre los cinco mejores que ya es muy dif cil depende del saber estar de aguantar en los momentos dif ciles y de no venirse abajo eso es lo que destacar a de l su mentalidad y su poder o f sico
550509 he sido campe n en roland garros finalista del abierto de australia y del torneo de maestros adem s de n mero uno te bastar a con eso
550510 el n mero uno es algo que l persigue desde hace mucho tiempo
550511 lo que rafa ha conseguido es muy importante para el tenis espa ol porque volvemos a tener el n mero uno m s arriba no se puede subir por eso hay que relajarse y disfrutar no meterte m s presi n pensando en mantener el puesto cuando est s ah arriba todo el mundo te tiene mucho respeto y se abre m s distancia con los dem s
550512 se merece todo el cr dito del mundo porque lo primero que tuvo que hacer fue defender su n mero dos contra djokovic desde entonces ha entrado en una racha ganadora
550513 en 2008 el mundo ser bendecido lo llamar n el nico
550514 contrariamente a lo que pueda parecer los campos de los juegos ol mpicos no tienen la mejor superficie del mundo
550515 el campo de atenas era complicado y el campo de pek n es peor es de una marca australiana llamada poligrass que es la que gan el concurso pero no es la mejor es de polietileno barato
550516 hemos tenido la suerte de que la empresa que monta los campos en espa a conoc a al distribuidor de poligrass identificamos la superficie hablamos con manolo fonseca el director de deportes y el csd acept la propuesta de correr con los gastos
550517 la misma superficie que se despleg en pek n en agosto de 2007 la tuvimos nosotros en terrassa en noviembre
550518 pintamos el fondo amarillo y lo rodeamos de telas azules igual que el estadio de china de ese modo la percepci n perif rica ser a igual esto nos permiti concentrarnos para entrenarnos y jugar en un entorno lo m s parecido en el mundo al de pek n
550519 ha sido muy interesante hemos ganado todos los amistosos contra alemania que es el campe n del mundo ganamos dos veces contra b lgica otras dos nosotros est bamos m s preparados el golpeo en esta superficie te exige mucho m s aqu a que la tocas un poco mal la bola empieza a botar lo que m s cuesta son las recepciones de pases fuertes y largos y luego el chut de rev s porque al ser un campo blando el palo se hunde tocas la pelota m s abajo y se te va por arriba de la porter a pero ya nos hemos ido acostumbrando
550520 alemania estaba acostumbrada a mover la pelota horizontalmente muy r pido desde atr s empezando por sus defensas pero en la final del europeo de leipzig tuvieron que cambiar de t ctica y ser m s verticales porque el campo ten a un mal bote y no permit a pases precisos con el campo de pek n pasa igual
550521 la dificultad aumenta tambi n porque el palo se hunde y afecta a toda la coordinaci n del golpeo la t cnica del chut requiere de un proceso complejo es como el lanzamiento de peso en el atletismo se encadenan gestos y si algo cambia por peque o que sea tienes que acostumbrarte
550522 ense ar esas im genes es romper las reglas no hab a ocurrido nunca antes
550523 fuimos idealistas y el idealismo a veces va unido a cierta ingenuidad
550524 pero no somos responsables del funcionamiento de internet en china as que no har apolog a de algo que no tiene que ver con nosotros
550525 es un hito para este pa s ha habido una mejora y eso es lo que cuenta
550526 tengo car cter otras son m s grandes que menos que defenderme
550527 tiene fondo sabe colocarse y se adpata a todas las aguas
550528 su brazada es m s corta y saca demasiado la cabeza
550529 es una gran competidora ah es donde saca lo mejor de s misma porque es una gran luchadora si tuviera que destacar algo ser a su rabia su fuerza mental
550530 car cter s que tengo pero otras chicas son m s grandes qu menos que defenderte
550531 en piscina iba muy bien pero lleg un momento en que ten a que decidir ten a cualidades para esta prueba m s all de tragar metros tambi n la orientaci n la capacidad de colocarse en la mejor posici n de adaptarse al agua en diferentes condiciones fr a con olas dio el salto en 2001

550550 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
550551 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
550552 nothing must be held sacred god is not great jesus is not your lord you are not disciples of any charismatic prophet

550554 i will have no truck with the perpetuation of fallacious illusions whether honeyed or bitter
550555 and consider the gibersons of this world to be corruptors of a better truth thats harsh i know but he is undermining the core of rationalism we ought to be building and i find his beliefs pernicious
550556 there is nothing that cannot be explained and that everything is extraordinarily simple
550557 the only faith we need for the journey is the belief that everything can be understood and ultimately that there is nothing to explain
550558 in the beginning there was nothing absolute void not merely empty space there was no space nor was there time for this was before time the universe was without form and void

550560 the city board of supervisors wants to spend 4 billion dollars
550561 if that happens that is 20 million lost annually in tax revenues
550562 that means rates would go up and up at least 400 a year per customer for 20 years

550568 and then they must have thought build it and they will come
550569 just because you put this ballot measure on how in gods name are you going to transfer 1 800 hundred employees and expect them not to miss a beat

550571 innate conceit and vanity will cause him to strive for the theatrical to pose for the crowd and the pictures whereas jeffries will go about his work in a businesslike manner

550573 just before the last safety car it became a little bit slippery but it was race able as long as you could see where you were going
550574 the driving is okay as long as you can get the water off your windshield if you have a wiper youre alright
550575 when it started raining hard again i had some oil on the window and just couldnt get rid of it
550576 it was very drive able it was slippery but it was the same for everyone so it was good racing as long as we were running in the front it was fun
550577 the priority in this sport has to be our drivers and you had a number of drivers on the radio saying they cant see and are hydroplaning under caution
550578 i dont think as a series we did a good job of listening to those so we fell victim
550579 joey couldnt see when guys stopped in front of him he ran into the back of them he had no warnings that the guy was going to stop i have to be honest i had a lot of fun today this is pretty cool its the first points race in the rain but when drivers are saying enough is enough we need to heed that caution and we did not today
550580 its my kind of racing but you really need to be set up right and the tires as old as they are theyre a little hard so was zero grip out there
550581 all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning all in all it was a great day except we didnt win

550630 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
550631 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
550632 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
550633 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
550634 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
550635 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players lambert ham bobby bell and many others
550636 these moves add a tower of strength to our already top notch teams across the rio grande valley
550637 benita steve and marcia not only have the experience and talent to lead our newspapers well into the future they have the knowledge of the valley to do so to the benefit of our readers and advertisers
550638 what happens is that a lot of diabetic women dont get diagnosed until the 28th week of pregnancy and because of this a lot of the fetus major organs have already developed causing some kind of abnormality like an extra finger
550639 down here in the valley a lot of the women are not ready to take care of themselves
550640 i thought you were doing it because youre a good person
550641 a lot of memories out here its kind of a good sweet coming home
550642 but even if the property values were to increase some of the people may not be able to pay their taxes because of the economy
550643 had we had a little better feel or a little better read on that at every step of the way i would have said hello to him walking down the hall
550644 its a different world for him and i think it should be
550645 and i think that were going to be a benefactor of that
550646 i feel like im the same as ive always been
550647 try to throw the ball to the guy whos open that usually helps
550648 obviously his lifes changed 100 percent but hes the same guy a little bit more guarded maybe but for the most part hes the same guy
550649 at that point in time it was a situation where i felt like i had to have his back
550650 he had been tearing us up since weve been here
550651 i dont think anybody would have thats why its been such a phenomenon
550652 theres no question that having a competitive quarterback does inspire you if youre in my shoes and youre trying to make those decisions
550653 the closer you feel like youre getting then the more youre motivated to go ahead and extend
550654 there is always a little nostalgia in some ways about the process and what it took to get where you are its funny you still have a long way to go
550655 im trying to play im trying to get on the field and get better the exciting thing really about the game is just improvement
550656 theyre a little better than i am theres good reason for that
550657 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry

550665 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players lambert ham bobby bell and many others
550666 hes still playing great it happens in every sport when someone sets the bar so high guys find a way of creeping up behind you
550667 i dont think theres a huge difference between a semifinal and a final but to win it would be huge
550668 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it
550669 ive been making sure i get ice on it after every match it hurts sometimes after matches
550670 we never approached this with the idea of breaking the bank and treating it as an unrestricted situation because it isnt
550671 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
550672 you bet youre life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there

550681 might get some type of injection in a couple of days
550682 the way jerry blevins is throwing and brad ziegler is throwing i could potentially use anybody in any situation right now
550683 i dont want to say that huston street is no longer the closer it might be more how well the other two guys are doing
550684 thats not a good thing either way you look at it for me or his wife
550685 that adoption decisions should be made without prohibitions or limitations based on the sexual orientation of the parents
550686 i can pretty much set the cruise control for 65
550687 as you and your type illegally speed down the 101
550688 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging that the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
550689 i said if youre worried about my confidence please dont be
550690 ive felt like ive thrown pretty well recently i told him ill do whatever they want me to do but id want to make sure i get some save situations
550691 anyone down there can be used anywhere im not going to make a blanket statement and say youre not my closer street could still close games if you have a closer whos struggling a little bit and lately a couple of guys who are hot you can switch it around a little bit
550692 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
550693 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
550694 defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
550695 badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
550696 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
550697 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
550698 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
550699 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
550700 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
550701 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
550702 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
550703 so do you sir we both got better than we deserve
550704 human caused stresses including global warming and overfishing are encouraging jellyfish surpluses in many tourist destinations and productive fisheries
550705 southern and western beaches may appear to be nearly half water and half jellyfish
550706 creating a natural barrier that keeps the jellies from the coast
550707 were coming up to the centenary of the 1916 rising and we need extra exhibition space for the museum the courtroom must not be touched its sacred
550708 the invincibles were found guilty in that courtroom they were hanged in the jail and buried there
550709 their inspector has written three reports at this point on this application and recommended refusal in all of her reports
550710 why then does an bord pleanala see fit to allow members of the board to again discount her professional opinion
550711 if information on the laptop is just protected by a password a knowledgeable hacker could easily circumvent that password protection
550712 there are indications that some of the data may have been held in an encrypted file structure known as teammate however information outside that file structure would be exposed and vulnerable should someone circumvent the password
550713 quando comecei a escrever o livro entrei em contato com a sociedade e eles nos deram um retorno dizendo que ser amos bem vindos agora com o livro publicado fomos ver de perto o trabalho que eles fazem com crian as e adolescentes portadoras de hiv eles moram l estudam praticam esportes e atividades culturais um trabalho muito bonito que nos inspira a prosseguir
550714 temos bastante material did tico que nem sempre atrai a aten o dos jovens a oportunidade de ler um romance com a hist ria de vida de uma pessoa certamente atrai muito mais a aten o
550715 this is simply unacceptable and must not be allowed to stand
550716 minister cullen who is to represent the irish government at the olympic games must speak out on this issue and make it clear to the chinese authorities that ireland is not fooled by the official claim that human rights have improved in china prior to the games
550717 we quite know what dna is it is a macromolecule and so a material object we quite know what it achieves apparently everything are the two sides of this equation in balance
550718 of course i turned around and bogeyed the next hole no 16 but thats ok because i put it behind me and moved on
550719 i missed a short par putt of about two feet on no 4 but i didnt let it bother me
550720 the greens are hard to read and its tough to get your speed right so you wont see many shooting a 65 out here
550721 anything around par or just under is pretty good out here
550722 i feel good that we are going to tanglewood and i usually play pretty good out there
550723 i hit it a lot better than i did on friday
550724 so im happy with the way im hitting it but i would have liked to have putt a little better
550725 ive got a chance and its my home course so im hoping to make up a lot of ground
550726 the older guys do have an advantage because theyve been there before and know what it takes to win
550727 but i have been playing there since i was 9 years old and i think that evens it out a little bit i feel like im right where i should be so well see what happens
550728 this tournament is pretty old and that would be awesome to accomplish something like that but i know being five shots back hell have to come back a little for me to catch him
550729 you just have to take it one shot at a time and not thinking about a score
550730 im thinking about being aggressive and hitting fairways and aggressive and hopefully the putts will fall i like the greens out there they putt real well and are true
550731 it helps having one of these under your belt but im not going to try to think about how long its been since somebody won it back to back
550732 you start thinking about that stuff and it doesnt help you
550733 ive been up there before so hopefully i can put together a good round
550734 appropriate representation of the issues and provided excellent guidance for improvement of va research efforts
550735 im grateful the investigators substantiated that there was waste and mismanagement
550736 has had a distinguished career and has a long standing interest in biomedical research
550737 i so wanted a baby and i so missed my baby
550738 for years even now i have dreams that somehow i found my baby and i do something really stupid and i somehow lose it i misplace him
550739 im with the baby and im holding a baby and turn around and make a mistake and hes gone
550740 im worried whether or not youre getting enough orange juice and the things you need for your baby
550741 i thought id stepped on an electric cord because when you get shot it feels like this huge jolt
550742 he didnt say anything else and we both just fell to the ground i had no idea hed been shot i just knew he didnt talk again
550743 i thought vietnam had broken out into the united states
550744 everything was about vietnam every kid tom was terrified that hed get drafted that was the big thing that was going on
550745 it felt just like melting when you lose all that blood
550746 i thought there had been some kind of space gun that was turning me into nothing its just so kind of otherworldly
550747 weve got to help the ones theres still hope for
550748 it was just so hot i couldnt take it anymore
550749 nobody ever said anything about the baby until i was getting an x ray right at the end of my stay in the hospital
550750 i was in the hospital so long i didnt get to talk to anyone or hear about it or anything
550751 i would go to the library and see pictures like the famous life magazine cover of the shooting
550752 the hardest part of it is nobody talking about it i guess everyone was too shy to ask about it i would have been happy to talk about it even my family never talked about it and i asked them once and somebody said we figured if you wanted to talk about it you would have brought it up all i can say is to be perfectly honest since nobody else talked about it i always felt kind of embarrassed to talk about that
550753 i think he had a real chance to be a serious poet and that is what he wanted to do he was really a remarkable person
550754 it was incredible to me just to fall in love like that and have someone love you so much
550755 i would like very much to write to you about the time when tom and i were together at the risk of sounding melodramatic i would say that it was renaissance for me i learned more in those two months than perhaps in any other period of my life i came into myself
550756 in those two months that we spent together we talked about everything to the point almost of exhaustion we were very hungry and eager to know about each other
550757 i dont talk about tom to most people practically never to my close friends who never met him because i think there would be little understanding the sort of things that were between tom and me happen so rarely in this world that most people dont even understand the language terms of reference and the circumstances surrounding tom and me are too bright too dramatic they tend to obscure ones mental vision to numb or jade
550758 that is so moving thank you you gave me back a piece of myself
550759 i recently started to try to do a search so i could get a death certificate i never received anything
550760 my moms dead everyones dead that would know where the baby was buried i have no idea i have thought of that for many years i dont know why i didnt ask my mom i wouldnt be surprised if they didnt even bury the baby
550761 it seems kind of pointless i dont know how to explain it thats over i have a wonderful boy and hes always been very sweet i think he thinks of that boy as his brother
550762 under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again and is going to help grow the economy right here in brevard county
550763 if we come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise where i have to accept some things that i dont like in order to get energy independence
550764 i have dealt my whole life with fires but i have never seen a sight like this
550765 the utilities will not be harmed but their customers will benefit greatly
550766 it makes so much sense for getting around we go everywhere in it
550767 i feel that we are about to have a total power outage
550768 to save 600 megawatt of electricity during the upcoming heating season in order to keep plants running
550769 there are important things and there are things that drive you and you dream about
550770 in 1997 we were two outs away and theres that missing little piece to the puzzle that never goes away you never forget that for sure
550771 especially if it all plays out the way we want it to play it it would be a very special thing
550772 i know there are other guys as well who are chasing it it would be very neat to have him be part of this after all he has done for the game
550773 ok you have made it youre here and youre probably not going away provided you dont you know fall to pieces
550774 weve been playing great the whole year but obviously the final two months are the months that are really important
550775 everybodys in a fight for that spot into the playoffs
550776 we have to keep fighting minnesotas not going away and detroits not going away its a long season and you go through ups and downs the important thing is to have a lot more ups than downs and so far we have
550777 people are not going to believe all the way to the end
550778 now some people are not satisfied with the way were playing right now i think people dont believe what we can do spring training we have a good ballclub i think if we stay healthy were going to be in the pennant race and we are
550779 baseball people fans i think a lot of fans are waiting like ok when are they going to fall theyve played four months good i know theyre going to be down
550780 i believe in this ballclub i truly believe in this ballclub like i said early im not here to sell a product and make people believe were good i think were good
550781 i will not bring in just for the sake of it
550782 we need to bring in three or four main players that are going to cost big money and my standards are that high that im not going to bring them down
550783 ive talked with him and he knows perfectly that he is an important part of our plans
550784 he is a key player and we are not thinking about if he leaves or not
550785 today he played his first minutes and you saw the real robinho after having only been able to train a couple of days you have to give him playing time and little by little he will get back into the team
550786 tomorrow he will also have playing time its good that hes picking up the pace of the game as quickly as possible
550787 i am looking forward to playing for west ham and ill do my best to repay their faith in me
550788 i could probably bring ole on for the last 10 minutes even now and he wouldnt let us down
550789 it was a very emotional day for him and fully deserved
550790 i would like to have scored but unfortunately it wasnt to be
550791 i have had many highs and lows and i cant think him enough for the way he stuck by me
550792 i met with gareth his agent and the chairman last monday and we agreed a 5pm deadline it was not coercion it was an agreement we felt the situation needed to be resolved and gareth and his agent agreed with this
550793 liverpool made their first intention of signing gareth clear four months ago and they have known for some time that gareth wanted to go and what the price was
550794 unfortunately the following morning gareth and his agent came in to say that even though the deadline had passed it was not really they felt seemingly that liverpool could still do the deal i was obviously very disappointed that that was still part of the scenario still going forward
550795 i gave it some thought and realised that at the end of it all there was little point in pretending
550796 i have got to get on with things i have got to manage a football club and i want to manage one where some players still want to be part of it the chairman and myself are particularly disappointed but thats the way it is
550797 liverpool will get their wish and gareth and his agent will get their wish at some stage between now and whenever it is
550798 to be fair to nicky shorey he has made it clear from this time last year that he would prefer to leave and ply his trade elsewhere
550799 we as a club have an asset and it is a delicate balancing act between trying to satisfy the demands of the player and also trying to satisfy the demands of the football club
550800 we had a good talk yesterday there was a little bit of interest last week and the chances are he will be gone by next week i am 60 40 convinced that he will be gone
550801 the offer was a firm one but we have no need to sell anyone and im not going to give anyone away
550802 it has to be a realistic bid in terms of market valuation and bear in mind that 12 months ago he was coming off the back of playing two games for england against brazil and germany
550803 i dont feel disposed to let him go for nothing i appreciate it is a year on from that particular moment but as yet the valuation is not what we find acceptable
550804 two bob is miles away as far as i am concerned
550805 i would dearly love him to be playing for us as he is a significant player for us so there are about three balls up in the air for us and it is unsatisfactory for him for us and for everybody
550806 badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
550807 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
550808 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild
550809 we have had so much sadness buried deep within us
550810 we have to guard against infodemics in which inaccurate false information is disseminated prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic
550811 the reality is that we lack the means to effectively deal with harmful internet messages
550812 the regulations violate the autonomy of the internet and are an effective tool for tighter media control by the government
550813 the regulations would bring about a reverse in the advancement of the internet media as a whole
550814 south korea is a leading testbed for the it industry and the internet media here certainly has a frontier like aspect in leading experimental democracy
550815 but the internet media should also serve public good and compared with other countries south korea has lacked the institutional control over the media in which people tend to expand and reproduce unverified one sided information
550816 if you want to sue me with the cyber defamation law go ahead history will charge you with insulting south koreans
550817 its football season now im trying to put everything behind me and concentrate on the season now its a good thing i have the support of a great organization and my teammates were all behind and my family and my wife its just time to focus on the season now and put everything behind me
550818 eating right is about maintaining good health and preventing diseases and prevention is better than cure
550819 our prime minister visited the pope a few days ago and invited him to visit iraq and persuade christian iraqis to return back to iraq though iraq is still a hotbed of crime and conspiracy many iraqis in syria and jordan have returned either because their savings were depleted or they were not lucky enough to be picked by the unhcr until now i cannot understand the criteria they are using to select the refugees the conditions here are still bad with no services at all we even boil the drinking water to make sure it is safe while we heard that in the green zone they import distilled water from kuwait to use for washing and showers
550820 i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home with necessary encouragements
550821 only 3 000 iraqis have left the country while 12 000 stayed and benefited from the exemption decision
550822 so we know there are some connections between thyroid function and cognition but i dont think anyone has figured out yet what the exact connection is
550823 whether maintaining hormone levels within limits will actually prevent dementia i think might be a big jump
550824 sure 911 saves lives sometimes but it should not be forced on me especially if it costs me money
550825 both of these men overcame my coaching and had successful careers
550826 his teammates certainly dont think thats the case gilbert can put us on a different level when we get gil back we can be extremely dangerous
550827 remember the major improvement in gilberts game over the last year or so is his knowing how to run the offense knowing when to call plays and what plays to call yes the pace changes but we can be a dangerous team when he dictates the tempo
550828 what took you so long when the guy is right there under your nose and youve known him for four years
550829 its the third time in four weeks weve come from behind in the fourth quarter
550830 im proud of the way we played when it was on the line when we had to have some plays made
550831 playing against more than just the best team in the nfl
550832 called me a boy ive got a wife and three kids dont call me a boy he did it several times
550833 im not going to lie i think a little bit of anxiety was setting in
550834 it was a great atmosphere it was a fun game to play in
550835 im just happy with the way we responded we were here to play its important for us to not think we can do this but know we can do it
550836 this is going to be fun i can see why people would want to see this more than once
550837 i wish people would stop sugarcoating it this is mikes thing
550838 caron puts toughness passing scoring defense rebounding in the lineup
550839 like the world series of poker i think it would be cool
550840 the spygate thing has diminished what the patriots have accomplished you would hate to have that attached to your accomplishments theyve got it new england coach bill belichick was fined 500 000 the team was fined 250 000 and they lost a first round draft choice that tells you the seriousness or significance of what they found through spying i guess you got the same thing as putting an asterisk by tom brady looks so good it doesnt look like he needs any help
550841 if someone questions your integrity if someone questions the organization youve been a part of ever since you walked into the league would it upset you so yes it does upset me if they want to keep saying those things maybe we just need to play a little bit harder
550842 but i dont know how you disregard spygate its there it happened you dont know what was on those tapes and how much it helped i think the commissioner just wanted it to go away
550843 susana aurora ooooooooooo x dios pobre ni a apart de q esta super plana x todos lados y q no tiene abdomen plano y casi no
550844 what should we do should we just check on it when we get back from the farm
550845 we dont know what is burning in there so lets have you guys parked further back at a safe distance
550846 saya memaafkan tapi saya tidak akan bisa melupakan apa yang telah terjadi
550847 gee im going to go throw eggs at peoples house
550848 get ready get ready get ready get ready get ready get ready get ready
550849 oh no theyre not these are ladybird books i learned how to read with ladybird books
550850 in a minute dont you want to see the books look at the books arent they cool
550851 if you like them so much why dont you buy some of those books
550852 what a great idea honey youre so sweet and so kind and have i told you today how cute you are
550853 im not cute im cooooooool can i go see the dinosaurs now

550901 peter barsocchinis exciting script for high school musical 3 called for the addition of three sophomore characters so we set out on a massive casting search across north america and england to find just the right young actors to play the parts we think these talented performers will bring lots of humor new twists and musical fun to the film jemma was one of the many young actresses that we met in london and she impressed us with her singing and dancing in addition to being very exciting and effervescent matt has a terrific personality and a great sense of comedy and fun and justin had a great presence and charisma besides being a wonderful comedic actor who could really dance i am confident that the three new actors joining our original cast will help to bring great musical thrills surprises and a lot of fun to senior year and the halls of east high
550902 i can tell you that if the script is good and if we all agree on a final script then theres nothing that is going to hold us back from doing it we have fun making these movies and thats very rare in this business
550903 an eclectic cross section of hollywood insiders think efron should get a cool 5 million for high school musical 3 the theatrical version of the franchise which disney hoped to make before the writers guild and screen actors guild strike shut down hollywood for several months efron declined to comment for the article and although contract negotiations still are ongoing sources say efron is being offered a salary closer to 3 million not 5 million for the follow up which focuses on senior year at east high whatever the price hes still perceived as a steal

550912 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
550913 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
550914 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
550915 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night

550919 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
550920 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
550921 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
550922 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
550923 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
550924 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
550925 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
550926 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
550927 is this what we want in our pristine valleys of clayoquot sound
550928 i would say no i would absolutely say no so i think we have to oppose all of these projects
550929 i never go to europe i never go to the queen and tell her how to be in her territory what gives the right of any other society to come here and say that to me and my chiefs
550930 give us a chance to do what we need to do on our own
550931 this is a clearcut like the old fashioned clearcuts that everybody knew would destroy watersheds would lead to erosion would lead to the siltation in our oceans in our rivers
550932 those precious places like clayoquot sound are getting fewer and fewer
550933 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
550934 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
550935 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
550936 what we are going to do is present a proposal for an internship certificate where they can teach as long as theyre taking the courses and headed toward the endorsement
550937 first we need to present it to the advisory board and then to the state board for approval
550938 its crucial that teachers in preschool and kindergarten are aware of the special characteristics of young children their needs to develop emotionally and socially as well as academically
550939 the benefit is better early childhood training which is one of the keys to long term academic success
550940 some of those standards that were first grade standards are now kindergarten standards the biggest change ive seen is kindergarten is very very academic
550941 you do as a teacher have to have a good background in this theres such a wide variety of abilities that walk through the door
550942 today being the first day i had students who could write their first and last name and i had children who had difficulty holding a pencil
550943 pull out of your hat of knowledge to help those kids catch up
550944 he would hold it in one and then hold it in another
550945 i took him outside and we played catch thats something that came from a p e class i had in college we found out which hand was his dominant hand by doing something totally unrelated to writing
550946 with the little ones you have concepts and phonetic awareness if you have that knowledge of cognitive development and physiological development there are different approaches you can take in order to teach the primary concepts in reading and writing
550947 from infancy when a child is born theyre sponges the sooner you start teaching them the easier it will be for them to acquire language reading writing math
550948 can i see more starts from space than i can see from the surface

550951 he doesnt know if he has the time for football anymore
550952 hes in several business ventures and hes doing pretty well for himself so he doesnt know if he has the passion for football right now
550953 we signed him late and weve been real pleased that we signed him
550954 the first pitch i took it was a strike and then i really dont remember where the home run pitch was at all i just remember hitting it and i knew it was out
550955 so you would never think that she would hit a home run the score was 0 0 and sara hit a shot over center field and im coaching third and im high fiving the other two runners that came by then all of a sudden i look up and im like wheres sara and i look over and shes in a heap beyond first base
550956 it went through my mind i thought if i touch her shes going to kill me its her only home run in four years i didnt want to take that from her but at the same time i was worried about her
550957 i heard excuse me would it be ok if we carried her around and she touched each bag
550958 honestly its one of those things that i hope anyone would do it for me
550959 she hit the ball over her fence shes a senior its her last year i dont know its just one of those things i guess that maybe because compared to everyone on the field at the time i had been playing longer and knew we could touch her it was my idea first but i think anyone who knew that we could touch her would have offered to do it just because its the right thing to do she was obviously in agony
550960 we all started to laugh at one point i think when we touched the first base
550961 i dont know what it looked like to observers but it was kind of funny because liz and i were carrying her on both sides and wed get to a base and gently barely tap her left foot and wed all of a sudden start to get the giggles a little bit
550962 yea yea i know but what the heck is teaching english what i really wanna do
550963 youre scheduled for an interview here in the hilton resort in 15minutes
550964 uhm i wanna ask how cn i get home are there jeepneys round here

550966 dont put me down on my crib or youll get the worst crying that you would ever hear in your whole life
550967 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings

550974 i dont want to say that huston street is no longer the closer it might be more how well the other two guys are doing
550975 he space remains adamant that any proposal to address the immigration crisis should not provide a gift to immigrants who have already broken the law
550976 such an action would burden american taxpayers and increase competition for jobs
550977 theyre hoping that by talking tough and trying to define democrats as soft on illegal immigration that it will mobilize more of their base and maybe even win swing voters
550978 illegal aliens are coming here to take american workers jobs drive down wages and take advantage of government benefits such as free health care
550979 though he is a hard liner the libertarian party essentially supports open borders
550980 this mixed message will not appeal to those who want a clear one
550981 that means we will not be able to provide services at the current level
550982 or make payroll through year end without taking immediately drastic action
550983 the city will still be cash short by 5 million
550984 which would make whatever i give you now obsolete with the next change

550996 i have some scientific basis to claim rebirth is possible
550997 but i wish to research further on the subject and am closely monitoring the development of the child
550998 in his present birth taranjit has never gone to school as he belongs to a poor family but yet when i told him to write the english and punjabi alphabet he wrote them correctly
550999 probably the people least likely to have a scenario like this pop up in their lives
551000 they havent had the cultural conditioning the layering over the experience in this life so the memories can percolate up more easily
551001 you could have poured my brains out of my ears i just couldnt believe it
551002 i would say he was hit head on right in the middle of the engine
551003 the child was so convincing in coming up with all the things that there is no way on the world he could know
551004 theyre fascinated by the mysterious and they built up a fairy tale
551005 he appears to have experienced something that i dont think is unique but the way its been revealed is quite astounding
551006 it doesnt change how we think i dont look at him and say thats not my boy thats my boy
551007 ever since cameron could speak hes come up with tales of a childhood on barra
551008 he spoke about his former parents how his dad died and his brothers and sisters
551009 eventually we just had to take him there to see what we could find
551010 his dad and i are no longer together but neither of our families have ever been to the island
551011 at first we just put his stories down to a vivid imagination
551012 when he started nursery his teacher asked to see me and told me all the things cameron was saying about barra he missed his mummy and his brothers and sisters there
551013 he missed playing in rockpools on the beach beside his house
551014 and he complained that in our house there was only one toilet whereas in barra they had
551015 he used to cry for his mummy he said shed be missing him and he wanted to let his family in barra know he was all right
551016 he wouldnt stop talking about barra where they went what they did and how he watched the planes landing on the beach from his bedroom window
551017 he even said his dad was called shane robertson who had died because he didnt look both ways
551018 i assume he means knocked over by a car but he never says that
551019 one day his nursery teacher told me a film company were looking for people who believed they had lived before
551020 she suggested i contact them about cameron my family were horrified there was a lot of opposition to it im a single parent so it was me and camerons brother martin who is only a year older than him who were being badly affected by this
551021 cameron wouldnt stop begging me to take him to barra it was constant
551022 i contacted the film company and they followed camerons journey to barra
551023 we had child psychologist dr jim tucker from virginia with us
551024 he specialises in reincarnation and has researched other children like cameron
551025 when cameron was told we were going to barra he was jumping all over the place with excitement
551026 he asked me if his face was shiny because he was so happy
551027 he talked about his barra mum telling me she had brown hair down to her waist before shed had it cut
551028 he said id like her and shed like me he was anxious for us to meet
551029 he also talked about a big book he used to read and god and jesus
551030 were not a religious family but his barra family were
551031 we contacted the heritage centre and asked if theyd heard of a robertson family who lived in a white house overlooking a bay
551032 they hadnt cameron was very disappointed we drove around the island but he didnt see the house
551033 then we realised that if he saw planes land on the beach from his bedroom window we were driving the wrong way
551034 we didnt tell cameron anything we just drove towards where we were told the house was and waited to see what would happen
551035 but as we walked to the door all the colour drained from camerons face and he became very quiet
551036 i think he thought it would be exactly the same as he remembered it that his barra mum would be waiting for him inside he looked sad there was no one there the previous owner had died but a keyholder let us in
551037 there were lots of nooks and crannies and cameron knew every bit of the house including the three toilets and the beach view from his bedroom window in the garden he took us to the secret entrance hed been talking about for years
551038 we visited them at their new address in stirling but couldnt find anything about a shane robertson
551039 cameron was eager to see old family photographs in case he found his dad or himself in any
551040 hed always talked about a big black car and a black and white dog
551041 going to barra was the best thing we could have done
551042 its put camerons mind at ease he no longer talks about barra with such longing
551043 now he knows we no longer think he was making things up
551044 we didnt get all the answers we were looking for and apparently past life memories fade as the person gets older
551045 cameron has never spoken about dying to me but he told his pal not to worry about dying because you just come back again
551046 when i asked him how he ended up with me he tells me he fell through and went into my tummy
551047 and when i ask him what his name was before he says its cameron its still me
551048 because office buildings have air conditioners and in the wintertime it would be safer because maybe employees wouldnt have to travel in bad weather on certain days
551049 im not certain at this moment whether this would be our biggest reduction i would be pretty surprised if thats where we would get our energy efficiency savings
551050 i wish i could work ten hours a day for four days instead of ten hours a day every day
551051 there are 76 000 children in child welfare care and over 22 000 we know are actively waiting for adoption right now
551052 we actually have three times the number of first nations children in child welfare care today than we did at the height of the residential schools
551053 many people only want babies and they only want babies from homes where they know there has been good pre natal care and no drug or alcohol exposure
551054 getting support like counsellors and those kinds of things you have to seek on your own and fund on your own that can be quite expensive
551055 this is a major milestone we can share with our sport and broadcast partners who worked closely with us to develop a balanced games schedule that satisfies the respective international sport federations ifs television audiences around the world and spectators who will attend the games said cathy priestner allinger vanocs executive vice president sport and games operations
551056 as with all games the schedule will maintain a degree of flexibility in timing she said
551057 we have to have contingency plans in place for something like this and also for a number of other what ifs that might happen she said vanoc did not elaborate
551058 after all the memories we had to see them go in
551059 i think the first year was probably the worst because there was so much anticipation from my community all the fans just saying oh youve got it made youre a shoo in
551060 and when you start hearing that and you start believing it and when it didnt happen it was a disappointment
551061 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
551062 well keep talking over the next several hours and hope to reach an agreement
551063 queda por progresar para llegar al 90 por ciento en los juegos ol mpicos
551064 tenemos un grupo dif cil con grecia que ha impresionado en el preol mpico y alemania que llevan ventaja porque no es lo mismo los amistosos que la competici n y ellos han jugado partidos de verdad tenemos que llegar bien para estar entre los cuatro primeros que es el primer objetivo
551065 estoy contento pero no nos vale con estar aqu y hay que seguir subiendo tengo un equipo con talento con condiciones muy buenas pero no sabr a compararlo sin sacarlo de contexto con equipos muy buenos que tambi n he tenido
551066 la imagen de jap n fue extraordinaria y la de ahora est en la misma l nea por tanto es bueno que queramos mejorar hay que mantener el nivel y superarlo hay que trabajar todos los mbitos y estamos en ello no queremos parar aqu y queremos m s
551067 me sorprendi con la velocidad con la que captaron no s lo las variantes defensivas sino tambi n las de ataque es una generaci n de jugadores estupenda con talento y con capacidad de asimilar las defensas en corto plazo en un equipo se hubiera tardado tres meses en cogerlo y aqu ha valido con dos semanas tambi n es importante la base anterior por eso intentaremos dar un paso hacia delante

551076 kak tiene contrato en vigor con el milan y es in til especular con su marcha del club
551077 no s lo va a seguir en el milan sino que estoy absolutamente convencido que kak se retirar como futbolista en nuestro club de un jugador de su talla y que es feliz no tiene raz n alguna para sospechar que pueda marcharse y desde luego no hay que darle vueltas a este tema
551078 porque he escuchado muchas cosas pero no he tenido constancia de que nada fuera oficial que el chelsea quiere a kak eso no es nuevo porque todos los grandes clubs quieren a futbolistas de la talla de kak pero otra cosa es que nosotros queramos venderle y como el milan no le quiere vender el chelsea sabe que no hay raz n alguna para hacer ninguna clase de oferta no es una cuesti n de dinero sino deportiva
551079 totalmente andrei fue un jugador muy importante en el milan pero es pasado para nosotros tiene contrato con otro club y no nos hemos planteado su fichaje

551100 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
551101 i dont think its accurate to say that my comments have nothing to do with race
551102 heres what i was saying and i think this should be undisputed that i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama i am african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from what my values are and so forth in a way that might not be true if i seemed more familiar
551103 el partido me ha dejado buenas sensaciones hemos jugado contra el campe n de europa y s lo hemos perdido por la m nima lo cierto es que los jugadores se han esforzado al m ximo y en l neas generales hemos rendido a un buen nivel
551104 el equipo defensivamente ha estado sensacional salvo los minutos que ellos se han tirado hacia arriba no hemos sufrido en exceso y tampoco les hemos concedido demasiadas oportunidades
551105 un equipo como el manchester te crea ocasiones dispone de muchos recursos tiene grandes jugadores y es el actual campe n de europa pero creo que hemos rendido a un buen nivel en este sentido
551106 en el choque hemos podido aplicar lo que hemos venido entrenando las ltimas semanas y creo que el resultado ha sido bastante positivo aunque est claro que tenemos que seguir insistiendo
551107 es verdad que en la segunda parte hemos estado algo mejor y hemos tenido mayor control de pelota pero nos ha faltado dar un poco m s de profundidad a nuestro juego ellos de todas maneras replegaban muy bien y sal an muy r pido cuando comet amos un fallo
551108 un jugador que maneja bien la pelota y tiene criterio ha jugado 45 minutos y los ha hecho a un nivel correcto
551109 no one ever gave us anything to read about it before
551110 well i think ryan would be a little easier for us dont you
551111 unless of course that person doesnt have a life that you understand or kids that you are afraid to ask questions about then you do not have to fellowship help them and make them part of your family of god
551112 there is no such thing as separation of church and state in the constitution it is a lie of the left and we are not going to take it anymore
551113 extrovert is this what god meant by fellowship and being disciples
551114 christian analyzing the subject a new woman of god with baggage
551115 demons be gone release this child come out of this child now in the name of jesus i know you are in there come out and let this child be healed
551116 we have no evidence that saddam hussein was involved with the september 11th attacks
551117 a prima facie case can be made that the united states is guilty of the supreme crime against humanity that being an illegal war of aggression against a sovereign nation
551118 collective fear stimulates herd instinct and tends to produce ferocity toward those who are not regarded as members of the herd
551119 for who has known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him
551120 a prima facie case can be made that the united states is guilty of the supreme crime against humanity that being an illegal war of aggression against a sovereign nation
551121 i wouldnt join the international criminal court this is a body based in the hague where unaccountable judges prosecutors could pull our troops our diplomats up for trial and i wouldnt join and i understand that in certain capitals of around the world that that wasnt a popular move but its the right move not to join a foreign court that could where our people could be prosecuted
551122 when a pickpocket looks at a saint he sees only his pockets
551123 it is forbidden to kill therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets
551124 you do not have to change survival is not mandatory
551125 might get some type of injection in a couple of days
551126 the way jerry blevins is throwing and brad ziegler is throwing i could potentially use anybody in any situation right now
551127 i dont want to say that is no longer the closer it might be more how well the other two guys are doing
551128 the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man
551129 the aim of military training is not just to prepare men for battle but to make them long for it
551130 ecosystems that have not been disturbed for long periods of time whether by humans or natural disasters tend to read a state of dynamic equilibrium which ecologists call a
551131 the nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them
551132 what is the matter with your women they are supposed to stop the men everyone knows when you let men cut down trees they dont know when to stop
551133 anyone not shocked by quantum mechanics has not yet understood it
551134 whatever you do will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it
551135 its the action not the fruit of the action thats important you have to do the right thing it may not be in your power may not be in your time that therell be any fruit but that doesnt mean you stop doing the right thing you may never know what results come from your action but if you do nothing there will be no result
551136 whatever you do will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it
551137 surely you now the exected value of the ticket is less than half the ticket price on average you lose money
551138 you could at least have made it a little easier for me by buying a ticket
551139 one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray we have the wisdom to choose correctly
551140 this guy is so rich he can waste money on overpriced socks
551141 you do not have to change survival is not mandatory
551142 sometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious
551143 when i am deathly ill and food is scarce it is best that i die and thus save food for my kin who will carry on my genes if i drag on we will all end up dying
551144 we would rather you lived we feel in no danger from you consuming food if you continue your life
551145 i dont know how you cook eggs ask the chef surely he must know
551146 it has to be that way when you consider how much variety there is in the universe
551147 its the action not the fruit of the action thats important you have to do the right thing it may not be in your power may not be in your time that therell be any fruit but that doesnt mean you stop doing the right thing you may never know what results come from your action but if you do nothing there will be no result
551148 first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win
551149 what else is it that should trace the insuperable line
551150 for want of a nail a shoe was lost for want of a shoe a horse was lost for want of a horse a rider was lost for want of a rider an army was lost for want of an army a battle was lost for want of a battle the war was lost for want of the war the kingdom was lost and all for the want of a little horseshoe nail
551151 you must behave as if your every act even the smallest impacted a thousand people for a hundred generations because it does
551152 i beg of you i beseech you do things my way i really do know better than you what is best for all concerned
551153 i am holier than my fellows therefore you god owe it to me to do things my way
551154 i am entitled to your bounty god give me my due
551155 please dont beat me i claim you are merciful with my tongue but in my heart i believe you are cruel
551156 i surrender let me be not so clueless and do it your way
551157 i wish i too could be young and cute it would be so great to have everyone chase after me
551158 the most important scientific revolutions all include as their only common feature the dethronement of human arrogance from one pedestal after another of previous convictions about our centrality in the cosmos
551159 it is not death it is dying that alarms me
551160 why should i fear death if i am death is not if death is i am not why should i fear that which cannot exist when i do
551161 where is the other lonely person im supposed to pair up with
551162 my how the citizens of bc must love me to spend so much money keeping me alive
551163 well it sure looks as if it is in pain it is struggling frantically to right itself
551164 your experiment has no point everyone already knows that hearts beat
551165 i thats what it means to be a biologist i want no part of it
551166 if you are so sure this will not hurt how about i poke a scapel into the back of
551167 i dont want the citizens knowing about this because if they did they would be furious
551168 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
551169 you are either with us or you are with the terrorists
551170 i think its great to get as high as that
551171 at the beginning of the year a lot of people were asking me if my new setup after splitting with
551172 i think my results showed that it took a little bit of time but that its paying off and im enjoying myself much more on court
551173 im much calmer and obviously my results have got better and better as the years gone on
551174 hes obviously got a great serve but ive read it well in the past today i did the same
551175 youve still got to come up with passes because he volleys well
551176 i hit some great lobs and passing shots which is why i managed to break him so many times four
551177 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for
551178 its weird because most weeks on tour theres probably 20 guys or 10 guys who can win on the last day
551179 but obviously if parker is 20 under john rollins has to shoot 10 under if parker is even par so it does put a stretch on everyone including me
551180 but parkers never won before so you never know he might shoot a couple over and around this golf course anything can happen you can hit good shots and get a bad bounce and be really in trouble
551181 it was my first time having a lead and i didnt really approach it the right way and learned a lot from it
551182 that one i looked past the finish line too early and this one im looking forward to the first shot on the first hole tomorrow and thats as far as im going to go
551183 as soon as i got suspended i called my agent first thing in the morning and appealed right away
551184 i think everybody knows except the umpire that when the ball hit a rod i didnt try to hit him but there are a lot of people in that ballpark maybe he got a little nervous i dont know and he agreed to do it what can i do just wait and see what happens
551185 hi commentator no hes not he went to get a pedicure
551186 my father loved egypt so much that he married my mother who was egyptian
551187 the hispanic guy who sacrifices himself so white women can live
551188 a grand salon a throwback to new york of old
551189 ask the average guy if he knows or has heard of rubin chances are he has but not rattner
551190 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
551191 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
551192 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
551193 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
551194 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
551195 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
551196 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
551197 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
551198 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
551199 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
551200 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
551201 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
551202 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
551203 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
551204 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
551205 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
551206 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards
551207 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
551208 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
551209 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
551210 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
551211 short term solutions to our long term energy problems arent just ineffective they will actually make the problem much worse
551212 freedom is not the right to do what we want but what we ought
551213 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
551214 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
551215 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
551216 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
551217 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
551218 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
551219 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
551220 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
551221 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
551222 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
551223 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
551224 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
551225 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
551226 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
551227 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
551228 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
551229 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
551230 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
551231 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
551232 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
551233 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
551234 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
551235 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
551236 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
551237 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
551238 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
551239 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
551240 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
551241 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
551242 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
551243 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
551244 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
551245 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
551246 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
551247 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
551248 part of a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty much everyone else online
551249 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
551250 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
551251 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
551252 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
551253 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
551254 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
551255 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
551256 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
551257 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
551258 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
551259 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
551260 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
551261 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
551262 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
551263 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
551264 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
551265 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
551266 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
551267 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
551268 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
551269 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
551270 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
551271 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
551272 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
551273 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
551274 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
551275 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
551276 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
551277 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
551278 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
551279 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
551280 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
551281 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
551282 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
551283 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
551284 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
551285 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
551286 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
551287 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
551288 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
551289 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
551290 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
551291 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
551292 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
551293 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
551294 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
551295 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
551296 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
551297 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
551298 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
551299 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
551300 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
551301 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
551302 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
551303 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
551304 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
551305 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
551306 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
551307 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
551308 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
551309 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
551310 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
551311 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
551312 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
551313 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
551314 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
551315 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
551316 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
551317 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
551318 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
551319 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
551320 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
551321 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
551322 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
551323 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
551324 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
551325 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
551326 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
551327 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
551328 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
551329 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
551330 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
551331 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
551332 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
551333 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
551334 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways

551342 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent

551353 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
551354 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
551355 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
551356 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
551357 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
551358 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
551359 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
551360 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
551361 if the vice president says its do able i believe
551362 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
551363 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
551364 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
551365 nos repugna que de juana est en la calle pero creemos en la ley
551366 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
551367 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
551368 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
551369 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
551370 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
551371 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
551372 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
551373 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
551374 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
551375 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
551376 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
551377 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
551378 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
551379 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
551380 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
551381 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
551382 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
551383 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
551384 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
551385 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
551386 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
551387 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
551388 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
551389 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
551390 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
551391 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
551392 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
551393 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
551394 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
551395 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
551396 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
551397 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
551398 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
551399 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
551400 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
551401 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
551402 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
551403 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
551404 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
551405 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
551406 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
551407 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
551408 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
551409 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
551410 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
551411 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
551412 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
551413 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
551414 i feel at home already put the word on me i want to stay here the weather is nice the stadium is beautiful
551415 i like it here im looking for peace i want to stay here at the end of the season if the dodgers want me to end my career here well sit down and talk time will tell
551416 after the game friday night i went out to dinner and nobody bothers you in boston you go from the stadium straight home thats what im talking about some people recognized me said congratulations thats it i could go to the movies with my family ive got nothing against boston but this is what im looking for the game is supposed to be fun
551417 its hard for him to know that after one game but i left new york and the first day at spring training i loved it with the dodgers
551418 its much different than hes used to maybe hell enjoy what hes doing ive enjoyed it here
551419 i cant take that what do you think i am juan pierre
551420 im not that fast im 5 3 to first base remember
551421 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
551422 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
551423 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
551424 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
551425 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
551426 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
551427 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
551428 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
551429 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
551430 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
551431 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
551432 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
551433 we lost two good men and guys who cared a lot worked hard and did everything they could to make us better its never a good feeling
551434 pitching in this league isnt easy and we havent pitched real well i dont think its doms and gooses fault we just havent pitched more than anything else we feel bad for those guys and to a certain extent feel somewhat responsible
551435 im upset that collectively as a group we couldnt pitch better so those guys could stay around
551436 they are two of the best pitching coaches ive ever had and ive been around a long time i understand whats going on they were looking for a different voice and a different perspective but those guys are going to be missed we have a lot of respect for both of them
551437 that has to do with the players not the coaches were the ones who have underperformed theres only so much you can do as coaches were the ones out there that dont hit our spots and give up runs or dont make quality pitches and give up runs
551438 if youre going to bring anybody in bring somebody who knows who you are
551439 ive known andy for seven years and im comfortable with him
551440 i think hell do a good job he knows a lot of the young pitchers and hell handle it real well
551441 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
551442 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
551443 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
551444 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
551445 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
551446 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
551447 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
551448 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
551449 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
551450 its better because were winning because to watch a team struggle and not be able to do anything would be the worst
551451 theres more adrenaline when you hit on the field than in the cage and then theres another level in a game so were being careful
551452 when youre not on that field you dont get that adrenaline flow and you dont get the rush you get when youre out there playing every day
551453 being able to be in the dugout and high five the guys and still be part of the team that helps too
551454 not being able to be down there would be a real struggle im just hoping when i get back to hit the ground running and help us keep winning
551455 i dont want to come back and feel anything after i play awhile
551456 i want to get everything to feel all right 100 percent back surgery is a bad thing and i dont want to rush
551457 for us to count on him would be wrong but ive gotten the message dont discount him coming back
551458 we never played on the same team but manny is one of the heroes in the dominican
551459 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
551460 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
551461 he has been pretty consistent all year he can play hes got talent
551462 im very happy for jody going down to winter ball spending an entire season down there having a good season there it opened a lot of scouts eyes hes done well its been a hard couple of years for him hes made an impact on our club
551463 i know thats downplayed a lot for me it helps to have a history with a guy knowing what hes got and what he doesnt now that ive gone through and seen a team a second time through it helps
551464 i feel like im sort of tumbling toward the old me its really gratifying i dont know what to attribute that to theres a whole bunch of variables the bottom line is that im happy to be playing happy to be producing in whatever capacity
551465 its a great place i would love to play here for as many years as theyll have me
551466 its a great place for families the organization treats families really well i dont know how much more you want theres good and bad things in every city but this is a great place to play
551467 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
551468 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
551469 hes not calling to see if you want to go to breakfast
551470 when rhodes got traded to be honest with you guys i didnt think it was going to be me
551471 i struggled all year so this year i kind of took a different look at the game
551472 and basically i just said im going to go up there and not really worry about whats going on up here because triple a is tough because guys are always wondering how guys are doing if theyre going to be moved today
551473 its my free agent year so basically i gotta play for next year
551474 i think when you kind of put that into perspective that youre not in a minor league contract where youve got three or four more years to where you can kind of have oh well i had a bad season well this year you cant if you want a job next year you gotta compete and you gotta play well
551475 early if we need a left hander or if we need a long man period if our starter goes out early he would be an option there
551476 roy corcoran threw a lot last night so if our starter had trouble tonight for some reason then we would probably go to jake real early
551477 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
551478 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
551479 volveria a hacer todas y cada una las cosas que hice
551480 la permanencia o no de un funcionario depende de si se desempe a honestamente o laboriosamente y ese es un resorte exclusivo del presidente de la naci n
551481 normalmente los sistemas de medici n generan dudas en todas las sociedades y todas las econom as
551482 hay que desdramatizar cada uno es responsable de las acciones pol ticas que realiza no solo en esta situaci n sino en cualquier otra
551483 a la vicepresidencia en la c mara de diputados de santa cruz como senadora en 1997 y la tercera cuando sub como presidenta
551484 volver a a hacer todas y cada una de las cosas que hice
551485 volver a a impulsar la resoluci n 125 porque creo que primera vez en la rep blica argentina las instituciones de la democracia discutimos en serio una ley que tocaba la redistribuci n del ingreso
551486 quien habla no ha firmado nunca un decreto de necesidad y urgencia y esto no fue nunca resaltado o reconocido
551487 no por versiones sino por desempe o de su gesti n
551488 el contralor de los fondos p blicos es total y absoluto
551489 cierta ingenuidad frente a la reacci n de sectores poderosos econ micamente
551490 los comentarios eran al rev s y dec an que la verdadera presidenta iba a ser yo
551491 kirchner era muy desconocido en buenos aires y yo muy conocida y eso dio p rvulo a que se construyera un relato de que yo iba a ser la verdadera presidenta ahora hay una inversi n y la que es d bil y pusil nime soy yo
551492 el salto tecnol gico porque de lo contrario nos vamos a quedar en el medioevo

551512 most revisions were intended to clarify for physicists who were not climatologists the method by which the ipcc evaluates climate sensitivity a method which the ipcc does not itself clearly or fully explain
551513 im a little ticked off that some people have claimed that this was peer reviewed

551532 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering

551535 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
551536 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
551537 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
551538 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
551539 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
551540 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
551541 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
551542 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
551543 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
551544 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
551545 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
551546 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
551547 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
551548 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
551549 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
551550 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
551551 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
551552 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
551553 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
551554 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up

551559 i have spent the last 14 months compiling testing refining and perfecting this course i am always updating this course adding new features new tools and downloads and the great thing is that you will never ever have to pay anything again to get a first class education on how to make money online
551560 this course is all about giving you a thorough working knowledge of how to make money from the internet a lot of focus is given to practical implementation most people fail to get anywhere despite having the correct knowledge and many great ideas because they fail to take action my aim with this course is not to have you follow instructions like a robot this is what many other products want you to do things always change trends emerge and disappear and if you havent acquired long term skills your ability to make money will be close to zero so the focus is on making you

551865 al principio en m xico se hizo mucha pol mica por la llegada de l eriksson y porque el idioma iba a ser una complicaci n se dijeron muchas cosas pero creo que al final tenemos que ver el lado positivo
551866 es un se or un entrenador con mucha experiencia que puede aportar muchas cosas al futbol mexicano que mejor tiene un diferente estilo al acostumbrado que tenemos all pero se puede sacar mucho provecho

551869 el tema ya se est poniendo complicado me produce una tristeza enorme estamos detr s del jugador todo el tiempo no sabemos de qu manera va a seguir esto seguramente habr una en sima reuni n con ariel ortega aunque tomar decisiones en caliente no es lo correcto
551870 yo veo al equipo bastante bien en la pretemporada por algo se trabaja mucho el clima aqu ayuda f sicamente aunque hay mucho calor seguro que cuando volvamos a espa a vamos a estar mejor ahora necesitamos acostumbrarnos a ganar para empezar bien en los partidos oficiales

551874 el a o pasado me toc vivir el a o de adaptaci n y de presentaci n en el futbol europeo este de ser el a o de la consolidaci n hay mucho ilusi n en este equipo se ha formado un buen plantel y esperamos que en la liga no pasemos tantos apuros como el a o pasado esa es la idea que tenemos
551875 nos toca el real madrid en casa yo creo que puede ser un punto de partida muy claro siempre cuando se parte ante un rival muy importante en el aspecto an mico pega mucho y esperamos arrancar con un triunfo en casa frente a un madrid que es el ltimo campe n conscientes de que si caemos derrotados debemos levantarnos a cualquier adversidad
551876 en la uefa ahora nos toca un partido muy complicado contra el equipo croata tenemos toda la ilusi n de pasar la siguiente ronda hasta la fase de grupos que ser a important simo

551907 its amazing i mean our playbook is so thick and tedious and weve thrown a lot at him but hes picked it up
551908 i go through that as much as i can i mean theres so much to it so many adjustments you just have to keep at it
551909 arron sears hes an instinctive guy jeremy zuttah is just like him the learning aspect of the game is not a problem for him

551913 i think all of our acquisitions have advertisement been very important
551914 for us to win this game were going to rely heavily on them
551915 a loss would almost eliminate us at this point just in terms of morale
551916 i dont think we could afford to go down another six points to this team
551917 but at this point our club needs to get a win wherever possible whether its in oakland santa clara or san francisco
551918 its like these pies and cakes at the end of every night the cheesecake and the apple pie are always completely gone the peach cobbler and the chocolate mousse cake are nearly finished but theres always a whole blueberry pie left untouched

551945 but its a important match so i still try my best
551946 tony is a very good thrower and has been doing a bit of work on it quietly in the background
551947 with all the injuries we have got in that key area hooker we think thats the best option we have got
551948 we were pretty spot on and probably the best thing was that it was because we were under a lot of pressure and there was group of young people involved for those guys to experience that and come through on the other side i think is really good for them
551949 rodney is a lot more comfortable there but you have to try things if you dont try things you dont learn things but he is definitely comfortable at eight especially when richie is there you have got richie getting there first and him getting there second as a forager

551964 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
551965 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
551966 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect

551968 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
551969 i went one day to the unit but did not feel like working i left the job to my supervisor it was too devastating and one of my friends was injured in the blast
551970 the blasts showed the ugliest face of terrorism where the innocents were targeted we want the government to punish the culprits and bring peace to the soul of my father
551971 things will never be the same again here the blasts in maninagar isanpur and amraiwadi have affected business and people hardly come to the market after the blast
551972 but we realized that one person remained in the house all the time when the residents came to know that they were from the minority community they raised an alarm and informed the police who picked them up for questioning
551973 the bomb was of simple make however the bomb also used fertilizer as base explosive we also went to 24 parganas to find out the origin of the bomb and were told by local police that the chemicals are easily available in market
551974 the attacks were not unexpected jaipur was a surprise as it did not come under secondtier city group in which ahmedabad and bangalore would figure besides groups like simi and huji have sleeper cells in the state
551975 we had asked the state intelligence to keep a watch on newer organizations working as a front for terrorist activities
551976 that national leaders wanted to create a base in the state is evident from simis surat meeting and later in bharuch maharashtra cities may have been used to strategize the attack on gujarat cities
551977 the suspects are between 20 and 27 and resemble muslim youths we are tracing our records to confirm their identities and have given the investigating agencies their copies we are not releasing the sketches to the media as it will give the accused time to flee
551978 we are working on a number of theories but apart from the confirmation of the location of the cars used in the act the location of the first terror mail and explosive material used we do not have any concrete leads the only key to reach the suspects is to keep a tab on the route from where the material was procured
551979 we have also informed maharashtra police to keep an eye on chemical units along the highway
551980 this time around there was no manhandling or abuse it was a simple interrogation session that lasted 15 20 minutes my father was asked to furnish the details of the bicycles we sold and rented during the last week and produce the records he was then released we were asked no questions about our affiliation or other activities

551997 that sucks balls man you chose that over great fortitude or great cleave
551998 actually the feat is called bullheaded it means i am exceptionally headstrong and difficult to sway and i get a 1 on all will saves and 2 bonus on intimidate checks
551999 that could actually come in handy you dont get squat for will saves and since you looove to use intimidate that should help
552000 im not sure im looking for mental acuity in a barbarian to be fair
552001 trap defeated you managed to salvage some vials of poison gas you want to keep them

552029 from day one ive thought it seems like hes troubled
552030 i would like to understand why he has done this if he had a change of heart then certainly we would want to sit down and listen to him
552031 we would want to see him back in the nrl and we would want to see him happy if sonny was to say hes sorry for what he did and admit that he made a mistake we would definitely be a party to hearing him out
552032 if sonny bill were to play overseas certainly the door would be closed on his returning to the nrl at any time in the future
552033 since i was a young girl it has been my dream to become number one in the world
552034 when you get older at least one day you can say you were number one and no one can take that away from you
552035 um were going to have to put some of those back
552036 there are some pretty good players ahead but ill just do my own thing and see if thats enough
552037 i know im not likely to catch one particular gentleman tiger woods by winning a lot of them but i certainly would be disappointed if i couldnt get my own piece of waterford
552038 ive seen tiger hold up so many it would be nice to hold one up ive been a long time doing this so im certainly overdue
552039 i played well today drove it in the fairway which was critical with the wind to keep minimising your mistakes on second shots the course is toughening up and i think three or four under tomorrow would be excellent
552040 i had a great putt on hole four that i obviously missed
552041 i hit the ball really badly on the back nine but it was very windy and quite difficult
552042 im glad todays over but its only the third round im not too far behind and there will be lots of birdies to be made tomorrow
552043 i followed his advice and didnt feel under too much pressure
552044 now i just hope it is the same tomorrow sunday
552045 im looking forward to the last round and being in the past pair again
552046 i have got some really meaningful innings in my life but the whole situation with so many disappointments since readmission in 1991 its bigger than just us i would have to say this is my best
552047 we got off to a good start but before we knew it we were in trouble i started taking it 10 runs at a time and took it ball by ball
552048 we are in a better position at the moment and need to look at one good partnership tomorrow and try to win the test
552049 i think anything above 350 will be a difficult target to chase it is not an easy wicket to bat on and it is deteriorating harbhajan singh and anil kumble will not be easy to play
552050 the indians are slightly in front at this stage but getting those late wickets was crucial for us
552051 it is an evenly balanced test if we can get a few early wickets tomorrow that will be ideal the pitch is turning but we need to bowl in the right areas and put pressure on them
552052 it wasnt an accident but the intent to kill the child wasnt there either
552053 a lot of things were gon on in home involving the child and the family
552054 mr mac is responding well to treatment and will be released soon
552055 he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well
552056 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
552057 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
552058 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
552059 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
552060 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
552061 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
552062 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
552063 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
552064 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
552065 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
552066 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
552067 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
552068 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
552069 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
552070 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
552071 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
552072 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
552073 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
552074 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
552075 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
552076 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
552077 i was just 15 and had no money for the expensive surf wear i just surfed in a simple bikini or shirt girls are very lucky these days that there is a professional brand like oneill that produces high quality surf wear but never loose the fashion aspect that we girls do like just for 40 everybody can look like a pro without loosing that nice feminine touch
552078 this space that is dispatched is broad to you by oneill
552079 oh i make that for my kids for the holidays
552080 my mom makes good mole i wish i had some
552081 they were very experienced but there was no way they could make it down the river with one kayak with the water conditions so they did the right thing and waited to be helped
552082 they were left with some financial debt so they really have a motive to run around the world
552083 they come right out of the 60s to a lot of people it looks almost like theyre from a different planet
552084 if there be any man or gorilla who shall object to this wedding led him speak now or forever hold his peace

552115 wall street is the villain in the subprime lending crisis
552116 they were extremely arrogant and it was kind of a turnoff for the world playing against them
552117 they sort of felt like the gold medal was going to be handed to them whether it was olympic games or world championships and they paid the price for it
552118 the first thing i noticed about watching this team play against turkey in macau last week they were actually pretty friendly and were sort of respectful to the referees theyre hungry right now i think that they know that they just cant show up and theyre going to win i definitely think theyre favorites
552119 speed and quickness are our best assets and we have to go with that
552120 someone else is going to try to use bulk and try to punish us on the board
552121 we had some discussion about a larger tire several years ago with nascar when we started this whole discussion about the car of tomorrow
552122 but obviously weve been working with the current size on the car of tomorrow this spring we decided to ramp that program up
552123 my parents still live there and so do my cousins and aunts and uncles its hard to hear what they go through
552124 its scary to see things on tv and feel like that is what is happening at home thats happening just down the street from where i used to go to school or thats happening in the neighborhood of a friend i know
552125 i have the whole country behind me which is awesome not a lot of athletes can say that
552126 it adds a little more pressure but the reaction that everyone had last time was huge so thats definitely a huge part of my motivation id like to shine a positive light on zimbabwe and raise the flag a little higher than it is right now
552127 kirsty has that extra incentive to go to the games and do really really well because she knows for everybody at home right now its really hard whether its because you dont have electricity or because youre waiting for gas for days in a line its just not a real happy place to be
552128 in 2004 for a weeks time there was a lot for zimbabweans to be excited about and proud and happy i sense that shes really excited to have that impact again
552129 i got nervous every single time my event would come on i felt like i was there about to swim but i wasnt i was sitting at home thinking i want to swim i want to swim
552130 that meet certainly instilled a lot of confidence in kirsty
552131 we left there feeling like all right were on track for some good stuff
552132 i think we have a very friendly very healthy rivalry we were roommates one year in college and we swam together for five years so we definitely have a little bit of inside knowledge about each one of us
552133 the one thing that hasnt changed is that the people are still the same people
552134 it doesnt matter how poor or how much bad stuff theyre going through when i was at home just walking on the street these little kids would come up and say hi and the people were still happy genuine people who just believe in their country
552135 im from the motor city id never been on a horse
552136 i thought how hard can it be the horse does all the work
552137 when sharing music becomes foreplay you know you have something beautiful

552139 we are here to celebrate tonys life and thank him for the sacrifices he made for us and for our country
552140 anthony loved this country more than anything else and he wanted to do anything he could do to make it safer
552141 he was one of the most courageous i have ever known

552150 fraizer campbell has taken his goal very well and it wont do him any harm hes an aggressive young player very quick and determined and he can do well
552151 his future lies here because dont have any strikers we only have wayne rooney and carlos tevez so fraizer comes into that area
552152 we are also hoping to apply for a work permit for manucho who comes from angola that will give us more back up
552153 carrick and rooney have been struggling with a virus for a few days and they wont be fit for the juventus game on wednesday hopefully they will be ready for the communtiy shield game
552154 other than that gary neville had a calf strain but hell be ok for wednesday
552155 i have had more than a year to get used to not playing but it doesnt get any easier and i knew this would be my last game at old trafford
552156 he is a top player who will want to prove himself in every game i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love
552157 to me face to face he always told me he wants to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me
552158 he is not going anywhere even if you come with a 747 plane full of money
552159 experience wise we are a bit short in midfield but we will see with diaby not being injured denilson being available we have quality in there
552160 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have if we can find someone then we will do it if not i am happy as well
552161 last year we were really really unlucky we were only four points adrift and lost only three games
552162 in two of those we were leading 1 0 until 15 minutes before the end

552166 we once again ask that the press respect his privacy and that of his family
552167 mr mac is responding well to treatment and will be released soon
552168 he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well
552169 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory
552170 will not have the opportunity to defend his good name
552171 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
552172 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
552173 is defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
552174 okay badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
552175 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
552176 i had no odd suspicions about him at all he was a very nice guy he used to come to work every day and pick up his papers and get them to all his customers without any problems
552177 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
552178 well your honor it was like this when the lady got on the bus i couldnt help but notice her condition she sat down under a sign that said the double mint twins are coming and i grinned
552179 then she moved and sat under a sign that said logan s liniment will reduce the swelling and i had to smile
552180 then she placed herself under a deodorant sign that said
552181 but your honor when she moved the fourth time and sat under a sign that said goodyear rubber could have prevented this accident i just lost it
552182 whether its an urban city or a small country city aids affects us all
552183 when i wrote that people were like this doesnt happen and i was like yes it does
552184 we live in the kind of society that we do not let people be free with who you are
552185 i love creating i love having ideas and having them come to life
552186 i was just very sad that they never mentioned the fact that his whole party was a charity for aids in africa
552187 i was definitely not getting him a mercedes benz that i wasnt gonna drive

552194 balthazar and sienna seemed infatuated with each other when they were in new york last week but i heard the reason the whole sienna fling happened was because he fell off the wagon he used to be into druggies as soon as balthy arrived back in la on monday he started pleading with his wife to take him back he told me hed gone to their house but she wouldnt let him in he stood outside crying the producer said he came back to a hotel and was on the phone to rosetta on and off for two hours crying and constantly calling and she finally agreed to let him back in the house in his mind he has definitely dropped sienna but hes in a very confused state at the moment his biggest fear is losing his kids

552204 experience wise we are a bit short in midfield but we will see with diaby not being injured denilson being available we have quality in there
552205 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have if we can find someone then we will do it if not i am happy as well
552206 last year we were really really unlucky we were only four points adrift and lost only three games
552207 in two of those we were leading 1 0 until 15 minutes before the end
552208 i was just a little bit off missing fairways by four or five yards and then i missed it big on 11 and 13 i was getting misaligned in my set up and it was affecting my swing
552209 my alignment was just not quite square to the target i had been swinging great this week but if youre misaligned youve got to make a compensation
552210 it could have been a better round but youve got to take what it gives you

552212 he is a typical southsider and you are a typical dumbfuck chicago democrat campaigning for daleys candidates
552213 for the first time since returning to democracy in 1983 the institutions were able to seriously discuss a law that for the first time relates to the redistribution of income
552214 i dont i dont like to sometimes i have beer though
552215 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
552216 acknowledges the fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery and jim crow apologizes to african americans on behalf of the people of the united states for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and jim crow and expresses its commitment to rectify the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow and to stop the occurrence of human rights violations in the future
552217 the notion that we could just waltz in and inject democracy into an extremely complicated devout and ancient culture smacked still smacks of neocolonialist legerdemain
552218 the surge has reduced violence we should all be thrilled about that and honored by the brilliance of those who have served in iraq but what were talking about here is whipped cream on a pile of fertilizer a regional policy unprecedented in its stupidity and squalor
552219 try as i might to formulate a further response to joe kleins rant i cannot one can argue facts one can differ on interpretation of events or one can discuss policy but one cannot debate raging venom
552220 what happened in virginia beach is they woke up saturday morning and realized not only do illegal immigrants work in your town live in your town but they also kill people in your town then del john j welch iii r virginia beach told reporters at the time
552221 the governments of the world must be pressured to demand that the u n adopt a clear resolution or law that categorically prohibits affronts to prophets to the prophets of the lord and his messengers to his holy books and to the religious holy places
552222 we are encouraged to see however that an awareness of the dangers of islamophobia is gradually setting in the west the condemnation by many western leaders and governments of islamophobic acts such as the dutch movie fitna are positive confidence building measures that lead us to believe that all is not lost and that the gap can be closed in time but mere condemnation or distancing from the acts of the perpetrators of islamophobia will not resolve the issue as long as they remain free to carry on with their campaign of incitement and provocation on the plea of freedom of expression

552226 lampedusa is on its knees and we need an urgent visit from the interior minister roberto maroni so he can see the dilemma we face
552227 the time has come for this to stop and for a solution to this problem to be found once and for all the needs of the people of lampedusa are being forgotten entire site copyright 2007 2008 european americans united
552228 the corinthian month names is the most exciting piece of news for the mechanism since its identification as an astronomical device
552229 more often than not the obama campaign is discussed as the home team
552230 i dont think its such a bad thing if for 15 minutes you take off your reporter hat and respond to obama as a human being at an event where youre surrounded by people of color and youre here for a united cause
552231 we reached agreement on the need to take care of the iranian threat
552232 i left with a lot less questions marks than i had entered with regarding the means the timetable restrictions and american resoluteness to deal with the problem george bush understands the severity of the iranian threat and the need to vanquish it and intends to act on the matter before the end of his term in the white house
552233 they had discovered the radiation leak weeks ago and did not inform the japanese government immediately
552234 the u s navys handling of the accident and lack of transparency showed there is no way we can trust them
552235 wed have liked to hear from the foreign ministry earlier
552236 over 95 percent of people living with hiv are not transmitting to someone else in a given year
552237 what that says is the transmission rate has been kept very low by prevention efforts
552238 these data corroborate what many of us suspected that the epidemic is worse than we thought however it doesnt seem to be getting worse
552239 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
552240 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
552241 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
552242 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
552243 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
552244 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
552245 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
552246 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
552247 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
552248 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
552249 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
552250 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
552251 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
552252 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
552253 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
552254 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
552255 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
552256 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
552257 we face serious issues in this election and have real differences
552258 im not going to assault sen mccains character im not going to compare him to pop stars i will however compare our two visions for our economic future
552259 this is someone who has been in washington nearly 30 years has a pretty slim record on education and when he has taken a stand its been the wrong one
552260 in addition period retesting could be considered even in the absence of risk factors depending on clinical judgment and the patients wishes because patients may be concerned about their status but not know about or want to disclose risk taking behavior to their physicians
552261 they were asking to enter the state of israel after being threatened by hamas gunmen
552262 theres progress being made i wouldnt say as much as id like at this point so were going to continue to push him

552267 why do we need to be out of the valley by dusk
552268 hot as it is it makes sense to me to travel this valley at night
552269 got to reach that ddd that ddd that gap at the far end of the valley by sundown
552270 dont know sir lamorak told me but he didnt say why
552271 looks like our river branches or another river joins the one we follow its near the bridge

552277 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
552278 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
552279 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval

552283 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
552284 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
552285 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
552286 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
552287 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
552288 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
552289 he proceeded to describe to the group a very long and detailed homicidal plan
552290 because he about to be indicted on capital murder charges he was going to go out in a blaze of glory

552293 weve got your politicians eating out of our hand we have taken your most beautiful young women as wives typically after having jewish children with our non trophy first wife you will do what we want when it comes to anything related to israel no matter what the cost to the u s life is good
552294 the reason seems obvious the press would have to write openly about a forbidden subject jewish influence
552295 the u s israel relationship is the single most important determinant of democracy in the world and we must commit to securing it
552296 it is so obvious to us that the jewish community is a family and that we have to take care of each other
552297 when the national anthems are played one cantor sings the star spangled banner but the hatikvah has two cantors belting it out with the audience roaring along
552298 aipac and its roll call of politicians would say that american and israeli interests are identical
552299 even a sharp critic like myself of what aipac is doing to american policy in the middle east was frequently moved by the pure loving feeling that surrounds you at every moment
552300 carrie said that at a synagogue she addressed the first question came from a high school girl who said but isnt israel an apartheid state
552301 this proves that we are determined to eliminate citizens fears
552302 a certain quality in an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural superhuman or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities
552303 there is a real threat of bosnia breaking up again
552304 he has set up the parallel institutions and sent delegations to montenegro to find out how they broke away he has used the autonomy granted by the dayton agreement to undermine the bosnia dayton envisaged
552305 played the race card and played it from the bottom of the deck
552306 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
552307 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
552308 theyre not listening to me because theyre out of touch with reality and the republican party we are the party of abraham lincoln theodore roosevelt and ronald reagan and this kind of campaigning is unacceptable
552309 the senator rejects the type of politics that degrades our civics and this campaign will be about the future of our country mccain could not be clearer on how he views these types of comments and obviously that view extends to congressman kings statement
552310 we can be slow to give greatness its due a mistake i myself made long ago when i voted against a federal holiday in memory of dr king
552311 i was wrong and eventually realized that in time to give full support for a state holiday in my home state of arizona i remind you that we can all be a little late sometimes in
552312 i do not believe in quotas i have not seen the details of some of these proposals but ive always opposed quotas
552313 i think in the past he had been opposed to these kinds of ward connerly referenda or initiatives as divisive and i think hes right you know the truth of the matter is these are not designed to solve a big problem but theyre all too often designed to drive a wedge between people
552314 on the one hand i think that what has happened in tibet chinas support for the sudanese government in darfur is a real problem
552315 i am hesitant to make the olympics a site of political protest because i think its partly about bringing the world together
552316 if the chinese do not take steps to help stop the genocide in darfur and to respect the digniy security and human rights of the tibetan people then the president should boycott the opening ceremonies
552317 in the absence of some sense of progress in the absence of some sense from the dalai lama that there was progress i would not have gone
552318 both the scale and the scope makes obamas buy unprecedented
552319 this is going beyond the battleground states this is coverage that the entire country sees it sort of validates his 50 state posture
552320 im not going to put my lot in with economists
552321 obama believes that real change usually requires consensus learning and accommodation
552322 its a hard sell asking readers to muster sympathy for the congenitally gorgeous whose job it is to wear designer clothes and walk in violet on the runway melissa walker pulls it off

552326 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error or shortcoming but who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself for a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat
552327 therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the labourers are few pray ye therefore to the lord of the harvest that he would send forth labourers into his harvest
552328 wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty
552329 let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience
552330 and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues
552331 for i am not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god
552332 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
552333 and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do but i wil forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him
552334 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding have all they that do his commandments his praise endureth for ever

552343 everybody is drawing up lists trying to figure out who the next bank is no 1 and no 2 how many of them are there
552344 and no 3 from the standpoint of washington how badly is it going to affect the economy
552345 failed banks are a lagging indicator not a leading indicator
552346 so you will see more troubled more failed banks this year

552351 the people of the united states have been robbed of their own history this is the worst kind of theft
552352 the jesuits killed lincoln and buried the evidence but just as water seeks its own level so does the truth eventually surface and make itself known deception and denial are only band aids in the modern day world of intelligence tooled by the internet and other high tech investigative systems
552353 today anyone can become a good detective if it had not been myself someone else would have undertaken the task of doing the digging and piecing together the true story of president lincolns assassination
552354 after the successful murder of the saviour of the nation president lincoln on that good friday easter weekend of 1865
552355 a date of which the symbolism was not lost the jesuit masterminds of that most evil crime began to pressure president johnson to implement the 14th amendment to the united states constitution
552356 this amendment effectively altered the citizenship away from the states proper under state authority and transferred this to the union under a centralized federal authority
552357 the truth can hurt but it can also set us free what do we have to gain from learning about this cruel conspiracy does it have any bearing on todays conspiratorial world of alphabet intelligence groups weapons of mass destruction bioterrorism weather modification and other forms of warfare
552358 what type of world do we want for our children and grandchildren or perhaps a better question what elements of todays world do we wish to reform in order to lift the veil of frustration and despair and unloose the shackles of ignorance and fear
552359 it is my hope that the history presented on these pages which has been suppressed for well over 100 years and of which the american people particularly have been robbed will cause them to wake up to the dangers being foisted upon them recognize them for what they are and then act to insure that the plot for their destruction will not come to its ultimate realization any time soon
552360 the strikes upon the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 marked a pivotal point in the evolution of the experiment of popular government
552361 what followed has been nothing short of a pronounced continuation of a religious war which had its origins in the middle ages using the armed forces of a compliant host nation or alliance of nations according to the wishes of the papacy
552362 the ultimate goal is the eventual re location of this so called
552363 this opposition to basic human rights was monumented in the famous papal bull of pope pius ix in 1864 the syllabus of errors a direct response to the constitution of the united states and its bill of rights
552364 the timing of the issuance of this document was designed to be a deliberate political act for the express purpose of telling the world that the liberties of the united states and any other nation which has the audacity to implement representative self government apart from church consent was in direct opposition to god this was at a crucial time of the war of the rebellion in which the papacy had openly sided with the confederacy
552365 every person has the right to choose their religion and answer to their god
552366 but no person has the right to use the machinery of the state or various other methods to force that choice on their fellow human beings nor do they have the right to use religion as a means to a political end
552367 the history presented is the result of eight years of research
552368 ignorance and superstition perpetrated by religious dogma set the stage for victimization
552369 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for
552370 its weird because most weeks on tour theres probably 20 guys or 10 guys who can win on the last day
552371 but parkers never won before so you never know he might shoot a couple over and around this golf course anything can happen you can hit good shots and get a bad bounce and be really in trouble
552372 it was my first time having a lead and i didnt really approach it the right way and learned a lot from it
552373 that one i looked past the finish line too early and this one im looking forward to the first shot on the first hole tomorrow and thats as far as im going to go
552374 i thought it was going to be the worst birthday ever after the first three holes

552381 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him

552384 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him
552385 everyone has to learn so that they can one day teach

552389 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical
552390 i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues

552429 here you have a man who knew what he wanted out of life and had the guts and drive to go out and get it while at the same time never forgetting where he came from
552430 paul has accomplished so many things in his life and unbeknownst to him one of them was setting the path for my brother kris and i to follow

552442 cause to me sometimes i wonder what shes gonna have in her mouth if shes gonna end up swallowing something small
552443 this bill is not gonna cause any toys to be recalled so theres gonna have to be vigilance on the part of parents not only about the toys that are already in their homes but also about the things that are currently on the shelves

552451 it sets up sort of a soviet system or top down system
552452 if you look at the big picture this will not make us smarter this will make us much more narrow it will only look at problems defense wants us to in a narrow way
552453 the potential for something to happen is much greater now than it was in 2001 simply because of developments of technology and education
552454 we may be putting dangerous pathogens in the hands of people who would deliberately cause harm we may also be putting them in the hands of people who may inadvertently or unintentionally take steps to put large numbers of people at risk

552476 for mccain to win in such troubled times he needs to begin telling the american people how he intends to lead us that mccain exists he can inspire the country to greatness
552477 there is legitimate mockery of a political campaign now and it isnt at obamas for mccains sake this tomfoolery needs to stop
552478 w hat they are going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all of those other presidents on the dollar bills

552507 as im watching this game part of it is watching those guys but part of it is watching all the other new guys part of it is trying to look at the scheme and how those guys are executing the scheme theres a lot of new faces to look at thats really going to come more from the tape than this first look
552508 we get evaluated on everything this was just another step
552509 i try not to pay attention to where chad is at i root for him just like i root for anybody but for myself i understand that there was a string of practices where there were some interceptions and they needed to be put to an end fortunately weve done that for a few practices now
552510 this can only help us its bringing out the best in both guys

552512 displaying hostile and abusive racial ethnic national origin mascots nicknames or imagery at any of the 88 ncaa championships
552513 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace

552538 these notices are in place for a reason to protect victorians
552539 we dont take the decision to ban products lightly but once we have made that decision we will do all that we can to ensure unsafe products are not sold in victoria
552540 traders need to be aware if you sell banned products in victoria you will be caught and prosecuted
552541 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world
552542 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
552543 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
552544 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view
552545 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times

552551 i just went out and gave myself some great chances
552552 you can score out here if you are playing from the fairway it gets tougher from the rough
552553 fraizer campbell has taken his goal very well and it wont do him any harm hes an aggressive young player very quick and determined and he can do well
552554 his future lies here because dont have any strikers we only have wayne rooney and carlos tevez so fraizer comes into that area
552555 we are also hoping to apply for a work permit for manucho who comes from angola that will give us more back up
552556 carrick and rooney have been struggling with a virus for a few days and they wont be fit for the juventus game on wednesday hopefully they will be ready for the communtiy shield game
552557 other than that gary neville had a calf strain but hell be ok for wednesday
552558 i have had more than a year to get used to not playing but it doesnt get any easier and i knew this would be my last game at old trafford
552559 it has been a great day for me and my family though the 20 minutes that i played towards the end of the game are something i will never forget
552560 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
552561 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
552562 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
552563 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
552564 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
552565 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
552566 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
552567 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
552568 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
552569 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
552570 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
552571 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
552572 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
552573 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
552574 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
552575 it was a safety factor we wanted to make sure that he was outside and to apprehend him outside away from his child
552576 her first words were that she was very happy to see nice people she was pleased with that and she was ecstatic about that
552577 i think its great to get as high as that
552578 at the beginning of the year a lot of people were asking me if my new setup after splitting with coach brad gilbert was going to work and questioning if it was the right thing for me to do
552579 i think my results showed that it took a little bit of time but that its paying off and im enjoying myself much more on court
552580 im much calmer and obviously my results have got better and better as the years gone on
552581 hes obviously got a great serve but ive read it well in the past today i did the same
552582 youve still got to come up with passes because he volleys well
552583 i hit some great lobs and passing shots which is why i managed to break him so many times four

552596 did you hear what ra l said last night in santiago
552597 he said compa eros i have bad news for you we all must sacrifice even more
552598 well that is exactly the same thing that obama says
552599 obama doesnt want to make everybody rich when he talks about equality he means that everybody should be equally poor not equally up
552600 he is a much better speaker than obama in germany obama was talking about the unity of the world this idea that were all equal its bull t you cannot accomplish that
552601 only a religious leader should use those words because we are all equal in the sight of god but in every human society there is a nucleus of leaders who move the society forward the promise of equality is a false promise it is manipulation of human opinion
552602 when you come over here its like the other cubans force you to be republican

552605 el reto que tiene bogot es conseguir la integraci n del transporte que como estaba pensado antes del alcalde moreno era integrar el sistema colectivo con transmilenio en este momento el panorama es m s complicado por que toca ver como se integra con metro transmilenio y tren de cercan as
552606 hay que pensar qu vamos a hacer con el transporte privado y en esto bogot ha sido muy d bil no est mirando hac a el futuro y no pude seguir recibiendo 100 mil carros por a o ya que en 4 a os vamos a tener 400 mil autom viles m s y es imposible que se pueda responder a esa din mica
552607 es necesario repensar la financiaci n del sistema y hay recursos de bogot y esos recursos se deben pensar en funci n de castigar el uso del auto privado parqueaderos peajes etc
552608 bogot va bien pero creemos que bogot tiene que mejorar en muchos aspectos sobre todo en aspectos estructurales
552609 la ciudad tiene m rgenes importantes para mejorar el ingreso de las personas y para estimular din micas de empleo

552614 in total 48 republicans spoke on the floor friday offering remarks ranging from the impassioned to the plainly partisan
552615 this is the peoples house this is not pelosis politburo
552616 back in 2003 i had a fender bender and got a ticket
552617 i forgot about the ticket and wasnt aware of the bench warrant
552618 hmmmmm im running for public office i wonder if i should look myself up on line
552619 then he said he had to look at a lot of samples that the fbi had prepared to duplicate the letter material
552620 n or should we ignore the possibility that a us biologist may become disgruntled or turn rogue while working in one of these labs
552621 the fbi must not let the death of bruce ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks
552622 the chance to prove ivins guilt before a court of law has been lost but the need for a thorough investigation and a full accounting to the american people remains
552623 it appears increasingly likely that the only significant bioterrorism attack in history may have originated from right within the biodefense program of our own country
552624 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
552625 is this what we want in our pristine valleys of clayoquot sound
552626 i would say no i would absolutely say no so i think we have to oppose all of these projects
552627 i never go to europe i never go to the queen and tell her how to be in her territory what gives the right of any other society to come here and say that to me and my chiefs
552628 give us a chance to do what we need to do on our own
552629 this is a clearcut like the old fashioned clearcuts that everybody knew would destroy watersheds would lead to erosion would lead to the siltation in our oceans in our rivers
552630 those precious places like clayoquot sound are getting fewer and fewer
552631 finally we have the right instruments in the right place at the right time and its allowed scientists to be able to make the necessary observations to settle this heated debate once and for all
552632 the metropolitan police will be sending a team of officers to antigua today
552633 the team which will include one officer from south wales police will support the local senior investigating officers
552634 yes the bad things are bad can i please go back to hurting people
552635 i think he is evil and we were his biggest fans
552636 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
552637 we wanted to have a pretty yard and we felt this drilling a well was a legitimate way to do it this looks like a happy ending
552638 from a scientific point of view weve struck it rich weve found a treasure trove of marine biodiversity that we didnt know existed until fairly recently with adequate protection scientists will be busy for decades finding new species and unlocking the secrets of these reefs
552639 youre just so disappointed that you cant do more the moneys not there the times not there were just scratching the surface
552640 to help guide the management of oil and gas exploration there
552641 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for said mclachlin who has won on the hooters tour tight lies tour gateway tour and spanos tour but not the pga tour
552642 its weird because most weeks on tour theres probably 20 guys or 10 guys who can win on the last day davis said
552643 but obviously if parker is 20 under john rollins has to shoot 10 under if parker is even par so it does put a stretch on everyone including me
552644 but parkers never won before so you never know he might shoot a couple over and around this golf course anything can happen you can hit good shots and get a bad bounce and be really in trouble
552645 it was my first time having a lead and i didnt really approach it the right way and learned a lot from it mclachlin said
552646 that one i looked past the finish line too early and this one im looking forward to the first shot on the first hole tomorrow and thats as far as im going to go
552647 i thought it was going to be the worst birthday ever after the first three holes davis said
552648 disastrous for the future of the americas cup he even hinted that bmw oracle racing the only american backed syndicate currently operating might not compete in the next regatta if it doesnt win its last chance appeal
552649 ambiguous language in the deed of gift the century old document that governs the americas cup reversed a lower court ruling that made san franciscos golden gate yacht club which backs bmw oracle racing the challenger of record
552650 if alinghi gets away with this it probably will signal the end of the americas cup as we know it coutts said in a telephone interview with the associated press
552651 we think its very very clear that the challenger needs to be a real yacht club we think the deed is crystal clear on that any other interpretation of that is mistaken and is going to be disastrous for the cup
552652 maybe what they wanted to set up was the alinghi cup coutts said
552653 if you have an enormously one sided situation a one sided set of rules clearly i dont believe that events going to be around very long he said
552654 theres never been a good explanation of why we all of a sudden we have to go to a set of rules where the defending team has all this control over all these race officials and jury and umpires he said
552655 they get to set the schedule of when teams sail and when they dont and when they can race and when they cant and so forth
552656 i certainly wouldnt be recommending that we challenge under such a one sided set of rules he said
552657 i mean what sort of a game would that be youd be pretty certain which team would win right
552658 economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement
552659 compare it with the way prime minister kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan are going were on the verge of a rudd recession after 11 golden years of costello and howard
552660 now of course wed like costello to come back because he can manage the economy and rudd and swan cant
552661 if i was peter i would have taken up the leadership back in december
552662 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him

552664 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
552665 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would

552678 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him

552680 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death

552741 yeah i have been surprised and the reasoning i dont really know if there is a real reason behind it i think its just to get my innings up and to try to see how my arm feels after surgery i enjoy it i enjoy pitching more innings i think its more just because its for post surgery reasons

552743 yeah definitely it definitely gives me hope their bullpen is pitching pretty good right now but its post surgery stuff i think they worry about so i need to continue to be consistent

552899 what happened was something that we never experienced before and unfortunately it was the kind of problem where if you have it during the race you have to keep it and deal with it
552900 when you finish the race its always good but what we want to see is obviously not sixth place from that aspect it wasnt a good day but in the bigger picture we finished sixth even though we had the problem that we had and we learned a lot once again we can only keep learning and keep getting better with this car our best days obviously are coming
552901 it was tough at the start scott pruett ran right into the side of frisselle and spun him out so i was kind of left with nowhere to go after the first laps the brakes started to fade a lot the car was working but we had the brake issue this is one of the hardest tracks on brakes we tried to come here with the same package that we won with last year to be safe and it just didnt seem to be enough this track is so so hard on brakes you have to get it just right the new car and the new pirelli tires work the brakes even harder than ever so it just wasnt enough if we had brakes this race we had a shot at winning for sure the car was fast enough everyones expectations are to go out and win but when you introduce a new car things are going to happen especially when youre racing against cars that have been sorted out for six seven eight years they dont have these minor problems quite so much and really all it takes is for one thing to go wrong and youre not going to win the race you have a flat tire youre not going to win the race today this was our flat tire well be back even stronger for it
552902 today was another example of just how competitive it is in this series
552903 we had a fast car as weve had all along since we introduced the dallara and a problem sets us back and sends us home in sixth place this was an exciting race a lot going on out there from beginning to end im sure anyone who saw it is a bigger fan of grand am racing than ever unfortunately we werent racing for the win there at the end but the guys gave it their best effort we had a problem that we are getting to the bottom of and well move on fortunately we are going to a track next week at watkins glen where we have had some of our best days
552904 it always seems to slow down a bit it loses a little bit of grip its later in the year and even today our practice speeds were a little over a second slower than what the pole was here for the race a month and a half ago it always slows down a bit to me it still drives really similar the handling characteristics of the car everything is similar your lap times are just slower
552905 were racing one car full time we have some different people in place at gillett evernham motorsports and we have a better starting point this year out testing has been great i think we have a great test team that does a lot for our team now i feel that everything that they work on is much better than last year i think the people are the main thing and the people are the main thing that got it turned around going in a direction to go up and stay up once it gets there its good right now its better than it was a year ago
552906 no its all the same its slower youre going slower off each of the corners your straightaway speed is a touch slower because the grip isnt there the patch in turn 3 doesnt have as much grip as it did when were here before its easy to slip off the top of it and get too high now which it looks like a lot of people figured out because there are a lot of marks above the patch its all the same its the same racetrack jus t a little bit slower and a little bit later in the year those are the things that you have to right again on sunday to win the race
552907 in practice we were not able to get a good qualifying lap because there was so much traffic so i wasnt 100 percent sure where we would have landed in our qualifying run but ill take that the key is to rebound from our recent tough luck and put our no 60 ferguson pipe floraganics dodge charger up front and in contention for our first career win
552908 im bitterly disappointed i feel like we really dominated todays race i made an error down pit lane i just couldnt see the pit exit and we sped i went down and had a look at it and its still hard to see im just really disappointed i feel like the race was ours today and i tripped over myself im real sorry for my team and stp and jtg daugherty racing for i let them down i guess its a shame
552909 it was it tricky for the first time for these guys to have a race in the rain we actually got a race in that was a good thing it felt really slow and the car was slipping around getting up to speed there when we first put the wets on i thought im real trouble here because ive just got no grip obviously i had no grip better than everyone else because we did pretty well it was treacherous it was tricky but i think all the drivers kept of the race track for the most part and we got a race in which is important i think to nascars credit for not running rain races very often that they did a pretty good job
552910 if the race kept going or the rain had stopped they couldnt keep the race going it was too wet i commend
552911 ive learned that i dont want to race in the rain in a nascar again its really tricky maybe if there is inclement weather again down the road nascar wont be so frightened to put us out there on wets because we got a race in everyone was safe and it was a decent show i guess the tires held up and the cars held up i thought for sure we were going to have electrical problems with all the water that was coming in the car but anything that got wet was me
552912 i feel jinxed full stop ive come along way to be part of nascar and im two and a half years into this deal and havent gotten a victory ive got second third fourth fifth whatever but that win has alluded me i guess if you keep knocking on the door it will come i feel comfortable out there i feel like i belong i feel like if we keep at it the win will fall our way but right now its a bitter pill to swallow i havent had this good a race and not won twice in a row before at a track its usual this place has been great to me were going to come back next year im sure and try and break that win then well be off but who knows im disappointed but life goes on ive got two health girls back home im looking forward to getting home and seeing those girls tonight and play in the sandbox tomorrow and have a swim and forget about life
552913 i think its okay we demonstrated today that we can get a race in and the tires are decent and the cars run maybe some of those cup guys dont want to run in the rain who knows id be happy to run a cup car in the rain not problem
552914 depends on if nascar wants to run in the rain yeah bring it on well run rain or shine i really feel like the race is going to be long tomorrow theres going to be a lot of cautions the weather is going to be unpredictable its going to create a lot of change in the outcome of the race im sure
552915 were both driving fords so we see each other from time to time hes not overly friendly to me so its his choice to make the next move i tried to clear the air after mexico i dont know owe him anything i dont owe him more an apology more than ive already done if he wants to talk or not thats his choice ive got no bad feelings im looking forward to racing him hard on saturday and hopefully one of us will put a ford in victory lane
552916 the track was in good condition there was no issue at all the track stood up well for us theres some patches from last year obviously after the formula one race which gives us different grip its a just a slight change in the way we set the cars up the track is in good condition
552917 i dont know about nationwide races i think all our sponsors that were currently with in the nationwide series have committed to go cup racing weve got a few irons in the fire on nationwide deals for other drivers i think as a group were going to field a really good team in the nationwide series whether im part of that or not its up to the sponsors and the team to decide that but i would like to if someone else could put me in their car too they can give me a phone call the more races i do the better im gonna get
552918 ive been there twice and ive seen the crowd drop both years if the market wasnt there for it i can understand not wanting to go back it was fun to have three road course races on the calendar its good for us road ringers but its nascars choice to go where they want they keep giving us money to race so ill keep turning up wherever the send us
552919 im not sure youll have to ask the canadians that its nice to have an international feel in the nationwide series its a point of difference from the championship theres a couple of canadian drivers that race now in the nationwide series theres some crossover there and some merit to it i like traveling obviously i like to get another stamp on my passport every now and then which is good
552920 its nascars choice it looks like it could be touch and go for some showers im not sure if the weather tires would have the most grip ive ever since i saw them in mexico and the looked a little purple nascar will do everything they can to get the race in and it if rains im happy to run ill run anything
552921 this weekend feels like a holiday because i had so much pressure last week to make the show and it was my first cup start on an oval i come here with only one event to worry about plus its a road race plus the car is handling well it feels like im just on cruise control
552922 the car is good we had a gearbox issue there the first practice im worried about that we want the gearbox to last and be durable for us and not be a weak link so thats a worry for me but the car itself is handling really well weve got good power here this weekend were getting of the corners well with our suspension package i feel like were in good shape
552923 kenny francis team director and our budweiser team gave us great racecars and the pit crew made it a total package it was a complete team effort
552924 there are no real big gains in the equipment anymore
552925 its in the choreography and in the physical ability of the pit crew members
552926 the teams performance is a reflection of our operations and what they do here at gillett evernham motorsports during the week
552927 this team works hard and prepares all week to go out on sundays and execute our strategy our objective is to get all three teams performing at that level so each can challenge for such awards and accolades we appreciate our peers recognizing the no 9 crew for this award our sponsors and mechanix wear for developing a program that rewards the efforts of the pit crews
552928 half of our victory is gained from executing strategy performing good pit stops and giving the driver a real chance at winning the other half is through synergizing the front and the rear team together as one kinetic force

552930 we are honored to have tow truck in a box join us on the no 10 dodge as well as our nationwide car
552931 michigan talladega and watkins glen are all very different tracks but i know we will represent tow truck in a box well
552932 were building a great home so we called a great carpentier
552933 tow truck in a box is as important to own as a spare tire and jumper cables
552934 our company manufactures high quality products that are built to last tow truck in a box is guaranteed for life thus any sponsorship we partake in must represent quality on a professional and personal level
552935 patricks driving talents are obvious hes also a family man and a gentleman i believe those qualities are part of the nascar fans its also what were about and what gillett evernham motorsports is all about
552936 tow truck in a box backs us canadians because they know up here in the ice and snow we need this product as much as anyone
552937 we obviously had the best car for these track conditions
552938 i feel like montreal owes us yeah weve been in position to win and had the best car twice and couldnt close the deal theres always next year
552939 im pretty happy we didnt have a mark on our car we finished fifth we made a mistake and the rules are so new and we thought nascar was going to let us decide when to put dries on so we gambled on it drying out so we put a full dry set up on so we werent set up best for the rain but all in all it was a good day and the car was great i had a blast
552940 yeah its my kind of racing but you really need to be set up right and the tires as old as they are theyre a little hard so was zero grip out there all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning all in all it was a great day except we didnt win
552941 racing in the rain was a lot of fun im glad we didnt wreck im proud of my guys they did a good job having the car ready for the rain i just wished it wouldnt have started raining so hard and we could have raced a little longer i think we maybe would have been a tick better but that was good
552942 i kind of was looking forward to this because ive never raced in the rain but i dont think i will be from now on it was a lot of fun it got a little hairy there when it started raining so hard the car would hydroplane bad down the frontstretch and i mean a 140 or 150 miles an hour hydroplane is not very safe it made it hard to see there at the end it was raining so hard and everything was getting so wet the guys said there was an inch of water in the right side of the car laying on the floorboard in the car so the car started to fill with water and we were going to start having electrical problems well not us but probably everybody soon but it was fun it was a lot of fun im glad i made history today the first time we raced in the rain
552943 it was interesting certainly i dont have road course racing figured out on dry tracks must less wet tracks it was a learning experience i went as hard as i could that i knew 100 percent that i wouldnt run off course and i think that was our saving grace we werent fast by any means but we were pretty smart conservative on the pit stops and everything else we just did the best we could with what we had to work with it was a learning experience nascar did what they had to do to get this race in i credit them for trying we all learned a little bit and the next time we race in the rain it will probably go a lot easier
552944 all you can do is smile because in my opinion it was a pointless race we were running seventh when it was dry we had a great car an easy top 10 then it started raining and we were running in the top 15 then all of a sudden it just down poured and you cant quite literally see in front of you when i was going down the straightaway i had to get next to the wall and the only part that i could see i could barely see the wall i had to look at the wall and follow it down the straightaway it wasnt safe its sad that that happened the scott towels ford fusion was really fast we had an easy top 10 in the dry
552945 it was out of control out there i dont know if the tire was so old or not but it was just way too out of control for what were trying to do we made the right adjustments to where we could at least run competitively i wheel hopped it one time and got off the track which lost us about seven spots and then no one knew what theyre pit road speed needed to be because of the difference in the tires so we got nailed there on pit road exiting we couldnt see anything so we had to stop because we couldnt see out of the windshield just safety reasons then they threw the caution and we lost quite a bit of spots there at the end we were going to have a good day i thought i couldnt see it was a safety thing we had to pit under green and they threw the caution a lap later and it just bit us all in all the clorox fusion is in one piece after this the first time racing in the rain it was interesting
552946 its definitely not ideal i think for us we had a pretty good baseline last time here we were pretty happy with our race car so well go back and look at those notes a lot and take what we learned yesterday with the track being a good bit different for us and try to kind of incorporate that all into a best educated guess on where we want to start the race off and stuff like that i think the biggest thing for us was we really wanted to try some new stuff that weve been working on and were not going to get an opportunity to do that now which kind of stinks
552947 i cant tell you that because i dont know a lot about this place smiles i dont think it will just because last time here it didnt seem like it went through a transition from whether there was rubber down or not theres not tire issues like last week at indy so you dont have to worry about putting more rubber down and its not a tire thats going to powder up maybe itll change some but i dont think it will i remember the test here and in the test they were up top right away they were all over the racetrack so we shouldnt have any issues
552948 you know realistically we definitely need to be in the top 20 and hopefully better than that im bad about always wanting a little bit more so if we finish 15th ill wish that we finished 10th and so and so forth we need to get to the top 20 and get ourselves solidly up there and they try to get some more positions from there and see where we end up when the 500 miles is over
552949 depends on the weather i know its supposed to be pretty cool tomorrow but the sun is going to be out which is going to make it slick i think yesterday was probably 85 86 degrees and tomorrow is supposed to be 71 as the high thats going to be a little bit of curveball the track will definitely have more grip and be a little bit tighter if thats the case well have to see the transitions it goes through
552950 i honestly dont feel any pressure or anything like that right now weve gotten ourselves into a few situations that really werent our fault and they have affected the points but you cant let that get to you we didnt really make a lot of changes or in practice i took what i remembered in june and applied it today we should be real good in the race tomorrow
552951 we just got a little tight during qualifying i think we will definitely have a competitive car well start ninth tomorrow and just work our way to the front
552952 i turn a ruger into a stroodle a stroodle into a noodle turn your pitbull into a poodle krs you need to a google
552953 nvidia called a meeting earlier this week with its motherboard partners to gauge support for it continuing to develop chipsets in the future the motherboard makers response silence
552954 the key to pocono is having a balanced car you have to make sure that you can keep your car turning through three completely different corners you have to keep the front end turning without losing the back of the car
552955 pocono is a unique track in that none of the three corners are the same you have to figure out which turn the car is strongest in and realize that you may have to give a little in the other turns to be your best overall
552956 the straightaways are so long you need to get all of the speed down them that you can so your car can come off of turn three as fast as possible ive always liked the uniqueness of the three different corners and the challenge that it presents to the teams to set up your car to be fast at each of the different ends
552957 its big to have a break to recharge your batteries especially for our crew
552958 they havent been home in about six weeks dating back to the nhra englishtown event it wasnt much of a break though we tested earlier this week so it was very short down time the boys were right back at it
552959 we have to learn to be consistent and focus on winning not just qualifying well thats our focus just getting in a good stride as we get ready for the countdown dad roy johnson allens engine builder and father has really been giving me some awesome engines to work with the mopar hemi power plants have been great recently just making a ton of horsepower
552960 i am really excited about this groundbreaking collaboration with mohawk internet technologies
552961 to my knowledge this is the first time a mohawk business has entered the world of nascar not only am i thrilled to have their support but i am also a longtime client and i can attest first hand to the quality and performance of their cutting edge services and technology
552962 in over 400 years the mohawk people have never been defeated in battle and it is with that knowledge and sense of history that we are proud to place the name of mohawk internet technologies on the car of 29 mr pierre bourque whom we believe will carry that tradition forward
552963 i really like the challenges of every racetrack but racing on a road course comes natural to me its second nature we are here with an aggressive attitude because its a place where we know we can win
552964 i just cant say enough about tony gibson and this no 8 team
552965 these guys are putting me in great race cars each week and its really showing in our qualifying efforts
552966 as for the race we qualified third here in june and we did not run quite as well in the race we know that it will be key tomorrow that we have two productive practice sessions and if we can build on what we have then we may just have a car that can be competitive on sunday
552967 i also have to give a big shout out to these ecr earnhardt childress racing engines
552968 these engines have some really big power under the hood and they sure make it a lot of fun to drive these cars
552969 but we should have a good car and i know id love nothing more than to see this no 8 team and that steak umm car in victory lane on sunday
552970 were beginning to develop an understanding with every lap thats run on the race track regarding the feel im looking for in the race car
552971 to broaden our fudge brownies appeal we tested a few brownies topped with chocolate chips instead consumers really liked the richer chocolate taste that the chips added but the product looked boring to make the product fun brightly colored candy coated chocolate chips were added during brainstorming sessions various colorful names were offered however when someone thought of the contrast between the dark fudge and the bright candy chips it brought to mind cosmic bowling thus the cosmic brownie name was born and was an instant hit with consumers little debbie cosmic brownies quickly became a household favorite and is now one of our top ten products which millions of consumers enjoy each week
552972 its tough i was tight down in turn 1 not perfect i had a great turn 2 and was pretty good in turn 3 but turn 1 is where i lost the most time
552973 we had an awesome dodge charger back in june here at pocono i hope that we can run well again this weekend its going to be a real battle to make it in the chase these next six races so it real important to run consistent and stay up front
552974 i got busy off of turn 3 i took it easy into turn 1 and into turn 2 i felt the car was underneath me in turn 3 i just got tight rolling through the middle i kept my foot in it and the wall was coming a lot quicker than the straightaway i had to make a quick decision and ended up snapping the rear loose and grabbed the tail against the wall we lost about a tenth of a second from that so we were about a sixth place car all in all were just trying to get our miller lite dodge tied together on entry corner and exit right now we have three different things going on
552975 in practice we ran a 70 54 70 sec and i wasnt sure if we could pick up any more speed i need to take a look at the video of our run to see where we got better because we need to apply that to race trim tomorrow im really excited about the run we unloaded a lot better then we did last time here and in qualifying trim today we made the most pick up of anybody everybody did a good job today
552976 it was good i was too tight coming out of turn 3 and lost some time we made some changes from practice because we struggled and couldnt really get a good lap in lap wise it doesnt get much better than that for our texaco havoline dodge it was just turn 3 that got me i couldnt get back into the gas because it was just too tight but overall it was good
552977 the hardest thing is just learning to drive the car differently you have to be able to communicate to the crew chief the changes that you have to make and im still learning how to do that for the cot our dodge is pretty good today now we can go back and work on our race setup and try to go forward and seem if we can pick up some more time
552978 yeah we worked on it a lot this morning and i think that we have a pretty good idea what we have to do for tomorrow the cool thing is that with kasey kahne here and the success that he had here last june weve got some good data to work from tomorrow
552979 im pretty happy with it we only picked up about three tenths from where we should have been in practice our first qualifying run in practice we were really good and just too loose coming off of three and i got loose and had to get out of it i knew we had a bit more there so we made some pretty good changes and actually didnt feel like we really found anything that we liked a whole lot better so we kind of went back there just tightened it up a little bit i feel like i could have gotten a little bit more out of the car i got back on the gas a little bit too soon coming out of turn 1 but the mobil 1 dodge was really good through turns 2 and 3 so with the exception of turn 1 i think we could have had another tenth or two there and thats big jumps if you look at the time and what a tenth or two will give you little bit disappointed that i was too eager to get going there again but real happy with the big improvement over what we had when we came here in june i think it shows that were progressing we just need to come back to these places a second time for me to know what i need out of the car and what i need to do as a driver to be able to do well
552980 no we worked on so much race stuff that we didnt concentrate too much on our qualifying setup and it showed today we were banking on it raining tomorrow but hoped to get a little bit closer on our qualifying run we were just way too loose in qualifying and kind of dug ourselves a hole now
552981 we were ok we need to be a little bitter well keep working on it and try to pass a lot of cars on sunday
552982 its ok we did two run in race trim and it was ok it was a step forward from the last time where were here in our target dodge
552983 it will be nice to get two more practice sessions in tomorrow were trying a different setup than we had the last time we raced here so it will be nice to get out here and tune on it a little bit more
552984 every time that i get in these cars i learn more and more the 45 team is getting better and better and i think that were going to surprise some people this weekend this is one of my favorite race tracks stewart cooper crew chief and the guys are working really hard and i think that its paying off
552985 its certainly not what we ran in practice we ran three tenths quicker in practice and everybody else is picking up we were just too loose coming to the flag and about 300 rpms shy getting to the start finish line
552986 we can definitely carry the momentum into this weekend if your throw out the tire situation last week everybody brings their best car to indy you bring the best car that you have in the shop you bring your best motor that you have in your shop with the most horsepower on the dyno because indy is one of the biggest races if not the biggest race of the year for us to go up to indy and be competitive on sunday as well as friday in qualifying and saturday in practice theres a lot of momentum on our team right now coming here to pocono
552987 yes definitely i hate that its taken this long to get going but ive changed a lot over the way that i do things i think that getting rodney childers team director over here has been great i really didnt have a crew chief last year we were going back and forth and thats hard in todays world i think once rodney and i learned about each other and what he needs to work on the car and what i need to do to go fast since the charlotte test all the pieces of the puzzle seem to have come together for us and the no 9 car once we headed to the charlotte test and learned a lot about each other ever since then weve been really really good we just havent had the luck that we needed
552988 well for us with michael waltrip racing and myself obviously coming back for me is just experience and gives you confidence but as a team were working through this new car and being able to come back with a baseline starting point is only going to help us to improve our performance for us its just a matter of making sure that we maximize that hour of practice thats been the toughest thing is you get an hour and then you qualify and where you qualify really dictates how your weekend is going to go not having to worry about figuring out the line and figuring out what you need to do that first hour and be able to just go out there and work on the car and work on your qualifying trim is going to be a big thing you can see that when you start back in 35th or 40th its really hard to get through the field these cars in particular are very hard to pass in especially when youre in that dirty air hopefully a good qualifying effort everywhere will definitely help that
552989 i think for me personally ive been relatively disappointed about how the year has gone so far expected to run a little bit better than what we have and definitely at this point of the year hoped to be starting to turn the tide and getting consistently in the top 20 each week we struggled last week at indy that was my own doing i crashed the car in qualifying and had to roll out a backup and anytime you have to do that its never a good situation i look for our team to really start picking it up here these last 15 16 races however many weve got left and starting to get some consistency down and hopefully lead things into next year
552990 its the same for me the biggest thing for me the tough part was getting in on the sixth race and not during the first five because some of these guys already had momentum they were starting to click with their teams kind of getting used to what it takes to be in this cup series so i started at a bit of a disadvantage as the seasons gone on im definitely getting more confident and the communication and understanding the car is getting a lot better we just made a crew chief swap two weeks ago and now we have peter sospenzo on the box he brings a lot of experience to our team and thats definitely going to help me as we improve our cars which weve been doing and all the guys at michael waltrip racing have been working really hard building new chassis lighter chassis i think that realistic for us is weve got to make sure we get this thing back in the top 35 and i think we can run solidly in the top 25 top 20 and secure the 00 in the top 35 for next year
552991 when i cooked food which are blend you will grumble that they are tasteless
552992 when the son came back the mother immediately ate the food without a word he son took a taste on his mothers food and spitted out immediately he ranted at his wife
552993 mum i am going to get promoted soon and my upcoming working schedule will be very very tight and as for my wife ummm she said she will be going out to work
552994 son please dont send me to the old folks home
552995 the son went for a bath after that and went into the study room he looked out from the windows and thought back and hesitated a while
552996 your mother is in old age now and if shes lucky she might be able to live for a few more years longer why not be filial to her for this period of time reminded by some relatives
552997 he saw some pictures from the stack they were taken at the zoo and amusement park when his mother brought him there

552999 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
553000 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

553151 identifying all those who are infected and linking them to treatment is the only way to break the chain of new infections and begin to address the nations runaway epidemic
553152 every year more than 15 000 people are dying from this disease and aids is a major killer for some of our minority communities
553153 the key thing we have to focus on now is what how and when do we begin to enhance the prevention responses to end this epidemic
553154 the horror of what has happened here will give me pause for thought the next time my son chooses to travel by greyhound

553169 i like this city the environment the energy in the fans i think that ill play here for the remainder of my career
553170 i just feel comfortable regardless of how hectic friday was traveling from boston with only a few hours of sleep going to a press conference and later play a game i started to feel the peace of mind that i was searching for
553171 the dodgers brought me here to end my career in this city at least thats what im thinking however we havent even discussed the future im simply starting to know this team
553172 i want to even buy a house in los angeles my kids go to school in miami and id like them to move with me to l a but there will be no move until my future here is confirmed i dont want to be here for two months and then end up in another city

553178 if i win tomorrow first of all its a dream for me
553179 but also to win the tournament tomorrow is very important for latin america and argentina
553180 hes athletic hes got a strong arm hes a good decision maker and he has a good grasp of what the overall scheme is trying to accomplish he is a feisty competitive quarterback
553181 he knows whats going on he does a good job of anticipating routes and where guys are going to be
553182 one i just like the competition and being in the elite level of something it just happens that its football two i think i can play here i dont like somebody else telling me im not good enough
553183 in the past when i havent played or been a backup ive always felt if i can keep improving thats all i can control
553184 tom brady was an even better player than i expected him to be
553185 competes every day at practice every day if he falls down he scrambles up and makes a play he plays the game just like he practices
553186 if only one person shows up then it was all worth it
553187 hey listen every year its the same thing were out here to win thats our no 1 priority
553188 hes got his job right now hes got a contract and hes expected to win the 49ers are expected to win
553189 he tries to do a lot of things to keep the defense off guard
553190 i have to look at the film i really do
553191 its hard for me ive watched so many things its not fair for me to say matter of fact every now and then i look up to see who threw a ball and theyre already over talking to mike martz and im not sure which one it was because they turned again i cant say
553192 im open to all three right now and thats where my mind set is as were all anxious to get to one i am and then again im not i want to know if we do have to get to another if we get to a second quarterback or a third something like that this is not just trying to find out whos one this is also trying to find out who gives us a chance our very best chance to win
553193 personal documents has many wondering if the 45 year old chief deputy minority whip is being vetted as a possible mccain running mate
553194 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
553195 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
553196 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
553197 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
553198 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
553199 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
553200 the u s may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the u s has long denied
553201 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
553202 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
553203 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
553204 a u s plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the u s facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the u s government has assured us that no u s detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
553205 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
553206 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which u s intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
553207 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the u s and accepted implausible u s assurances at face value
553208 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its u s allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
553209 it is deplorable that previous u s assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of u s activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
553210 responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
553211 diego garcia is an obvious place for a secret facility they want somewhere thats difficult to escape from difficult to attack not visible to prying eyes and where a lot of other activity is going on diego garcia is ideal
553212 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death
553213 mossad provoked americas air strike on libya in 1986 by making it appear that terrorist orders were being transmitted from the libyan government to its embassies

553222 we have also raised a few queries about the preliminary autopsy report of yadav

553225 they made a presentation to us and therefore we have agreed to defer cutting the commission by a month

553233 remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck

553236 when gary first asked me to be a presenter my first concern was i was going to have a difficult time explaining how good he really was
553237 offensive linemen get very little attention gary wanted very little of it there was no doubt in my mind he was the mainstay of our offensive line and a major reason why we were able to go and win our first super bowl in 1997
553238 there should be a stage full of guys standing up here receiving this honor with me
553239 i was a huge fan of his because he was the absolute best at what he did and he was quiet about it

553325 we can be spending more on technology as long as it is used to increase student involvement retention and ability
553326 this class has forced me to really reconsider the pedagogy involved in having students learn with technology versus having teachers teach with technology
553327 there is a place for both but i think we often overlook the learning piece for a number of reasons i know that i want my students learning with technology not just from it and not just from me using it

553338 the linebacker crew is going to be solid with the ability of jacque roman and d j smith we are going to be able to allow pierre banks to move around and go after the quarterback
553339 most of the questions asked this preseason about our defense is in the secondary where obviously we lost all four starters there is still a wealth of talent though and if you look at who could possibly be filling in with leonard love cortez gilbert and possibly billy riddle thats two seniors and a junior if theres going to be a drop off its going to be in experience we have some really good football players ready to step up who many people have never heard of because they were playing behind the corey lynchs or jerome touchstones
553340 hes going to bring a level of maturity even if billy doesnt win a starting role hes going to bring a wealth of leadership and experience to this team
553341 were very experienced up front with our offensive line we had some younger guys get to play last year due to some injuries and get that experience on the field now theyre going to step in and be starters full time bret irvin a center got to start the first game of the season and his career as a freshman at michigan and did very well potentially our group of offensive lineman could be the best weve ever had
553342 right now we are really trying to find the best group of four or five guys to have on the field at a time however all of our guys are experienced enough that we could line up today and start putting our offense in

553355 fred cam here with awesome ideas and was bent on proving himself to ucla executives he was not a chair warmer just to collect a pay check in fact i workd very closely with him and i was literally amazd to see him work he is a real charmer and i guess he did such a great job that at the end of theday he did in fact raise a lot of money for ucla they in return should be thankful as they received more than thay paid him to do i was certainly impressed with fred
553356 ill do whatever i can to ensure that my parents have proper care and if that means that i have to lie to get a job then im sorry mr and mrs society you give me no other choice
553357 i was personally taken by his zest for life his motivation but most of all his sense of honesty and humbleness
553358 he was so very polished energetic and he was extremely articulate
553359 freds a good guy hes good at what he does he gives more of himself hes a kind giving caring nurturing and loving person you never get a no from fred
553360 he raised well over six million dollars while he was employed there and it was more than anyone has ever raised in a six month period it is unknown where brito learned so much but it was clear that he had significant talents in operations and how to raise huge amount of funds it just came naturally for him
553361 what brought suspicion was the level of involvement that he wanted in the scholarship program
553362 this was the first time we called the police on someone who was actually giving us money for a scholarship but once we learned of his background we felt safe in notifying authorities asking them to investigate
553363 defendant is a well developed con artist and deserves state prison
553364 i tried to get a legitimate job and i couldnt
553365 after hearing no so many times you have to think out of the box and think of another way to do it
553366 i played the role of a psychiatrist and my friend was able to walk out of jail
553367 hes done bad things but he did it for good to help the poor
553368 he was very persuasive and legitimate appearing in his role as a priest
553369 when it comes to liturgy people will know when you are stumbling around this guy was pretty slick
553370 he was the best i had ever seen brito was by far much better than some of my authentic catholic priests i assigned him to lead two hispanic parishes and he immediately became quite popular he literally rebuilt the community and became very powerful in becoming the voice of the voiceless he was truly a very gifted man and i received countless telephone calls and letters from parishioners praising brito for his affection towards the people when i learned that he was not a priest i was taken aback however i must say that if he was never discovered he would be still here with my unconditional support and blessings
553371 thought he was one of the more devout priests that they had met
553372 the difference between me and them is that i took the role of a priest very seriously
553373 no matter what time of day or night i am here for you i am with you in times of great celebration and great sorrow and i am with you at any time day or night many of todays priests become a priest fir the perks and the prestige the power of the white collar is amazing but in my case i worked hard and i helped people believe that a better day was yet ahead despite the current challenges that face all of us as father fred i was genuine and i was very dedicated to the people i was and i became what all priest should be instead many of them only care about not themselves and their own egos and personal benefits that the role brings them when i worked in the parish i gave my heart
553374 i probably would have made a great priest a great elected official a great human being
553375 but i screwed it up by making mistakes when i was young which in turn prevented me from becoming the person i had hoped to be
553376 god came to heal sinners not perfect people and i am one of them
553377 a lot of people were very upset that i let him go they felt that he was very much an asset to this place
553378 we really thought he would be able to work his way up and become the next executive director
553379 he was just energetic and sort of bouncy and a go get em kind of person
553380 he set huge goals he talked very emphatically and very energetically
553381 there is no acting involved they get to know me they get to know my passion
553382 im focused focused focused on my job and i excel in that
553383 im very very clear as far as to what im doing why im doing it and what my goal is but in the back of my mind i know that at any given moment i could be discovered
553384 a large amount of it is psyching yourself out to do what youve got to do
553385 its exhausting having to play a role its exhausting that i cant be just fred but being just fred means unemployed and paying my debt to society for the rest of my life that is what is wrong in our society if you make a mistake and end up in jail or prison that is it you will never be able to get a job and if you do it will never be a job of any real opportunity or with potential advancement
553386 after such an exciting year weve decided to take a break from new yorks fashion week this season and focus our energies on a couple of new projects happening over the coming months we look forward to the next

553389 i wish i had spent more time with my father given him more attention been more attentive to his needs
553390 sanjay got very emotional when he heard the story he told me this is very close to my heart my father was from pakistan and i completely understand the emotions behind losing ones motherland this would be sanjays first historical and he sees it as a homage to his father

553399 if i hold it for a minute thats not a problem if i hold it for an hour ill have an ache in my right arm if i hold it for a day youll have to call an ambulance in each case its the same weight but the longer i hold it the heavier it becomes
553400 and thats the way it is with stress management if we carry our burdens all the time sooner or later as the burden becomes increasingly heavy we wont be able to carry on as with the glass of water you have to put it down for a while and rest before holding it again when were refreshed we can carry on with the burden
553401 so before you return home tonight put the burden of work down dont carry it home you can pick it up tomorrow whatever burdens you are carrying now let them down for a moment if you can relax pick them up later after you have rested

553411 no cause for concern in the way that community restorative justice ireland schemes now operate
553412 a substantive basis on which the secretary of state should not accredit community restorative justice schemes
553413 the balance between risks and opportunities has moved in favour of the restorative justice schemes
553414 any decision to accredit and fund is a political one driven by the need of republicans
553415 the nio has been given a mountain of evidence as to why the criminal justice inspectors report is flawed on many issues including complaints to accredit and fund restorative justice ireland flies in the face of this evidence
553416 the first thing is the concept is a good one but it depends on who you get involved in it and theres always a perception that its an alternative to the police and its not theres only one police force
553417 i dont know this individuals circumstances but it does suggest that there are problems with this process and thats very unhelpful in our current political climate

553468 trademark rights may be used to prevent others from using a confusingly similar mark but not to prevent others from making the same goods or from selling the same goods or services under a clearly different mark
553469 why dont you try writing your own darn story and quit trying to make a quick buck using what someone else did
553470 why dont you try writing your own darn story and quit trying to make a quick buck using what someone else did
553471 a right to prevent usage that is confusingly similar or which dilutes the mark
553472 mark confusing ip with trademark s immediately shows you have no clue what you are talking about

553475 wealth from the families of american writers to the executives and stockholders of various businesses
553476 the eu being a group of basically socialist nations is bound to go for this
553477 his criticism of the public domain shows that he has absolutely no understanding of it whatsoever stating that it amounts to passing
553478 for example project gutenberg which consists of thousands of volunteers putting public domain works into ebook form could not exist without the public domain
553479 various authors have taken stories from the public domain and reworked or retold them in new creative ways
553480 he fails to discern or ignores the inherent differences between tangible and intangible property and proceeds to essentially whine about how unfair it is that copyright expires all the while dismissing the fact that creative works are built on the foundations of other creative works
553481 following his faulty logic of equating intellectual property with physical property patents should be given perpetual terms as well
553482 and it follows that someone supporting a perpetual term should by logical extension support the retroactive application of copyright and patents to works already in the public domain after all shouldnt the grave injustice helprin insists is presently occurring be corrected for older works as well
553483 in fact it seems that helprin supports this interpretation as well since he bemoans the fact that katherine mansfields heirs do not receive profits from sales of
553484 so by supporting a perpetual copyright helprin is inadvertently advocating the decline of both creativity and innovation
553485 well give you copyright for 50 years if you make songs
553486 this doesnt encourage musicians to continue working and it doesnt encourage them to be fiscally responsible and save for retirement or anything
553487 this is basically an approval to steal from the public
553488 did you read the link i put in my original reply to you on this question clearly not it was in response to helprins article
553489 a the purpose of property rights is to manage the efficient allocation of scarce goods
553490 b property rights make less if any sense when there are infinite resources because there is no problem with anyone wanting something they cannot have
553491 c the argument in favor of copyright at all is to offer a bargain for the creation of content that will benefit society promote the progress and that means to get it out there and eventually into the public domain where it can be used to create even more works
553492 d removing the public domain from the equation i e making copyright perpetual doesnt make sense as it goes against the very purpose of property as noted in b

553494 and you can do this without having to pay the author a penny
553495 why do you keep insisting that lessig speaks for everyone on this
553496 secondly why do you not actually refute a single point lessig says you just brush him off
553497 for content it is scarce prior to creation but not after
553498 i would suggest you learn a little about the history of creativity and content production before you explore the legal issues here itll open your eyes
553499 i think we ought always to entertain our opinions with some measure of doubt i shouldnt wish people dogmatically to believe any philosophy not even mine
553500 leeches who want to turn a quick buck at the expense of the author
553501 gee it is difficult to track down all possible copyright holders
553502 spend eight pages trying to piece together two separate parts of the license agreement to make a case that copyright was somehow violated
553503 if someone pays hard cash for a ford mustang they are not the owner of said
553504 an example that is used to justify similar occurrences at a later time
553505 stay on line longer and use system resources the whole time
553506 if i enter a ford mustang only race and have modified the car outside of what the rules allow for then win the race and it is discovered that i have cheated i lose my trophy and am disqualified from racing that should have never happened because i paid the entry fee for the race
553507 if it wasnt transferred to the end user then how did the end user ever come to be in possession of it

553531 dealing with the press is something that youve gotta start getting used to
553532 and you know people want something to talk about so theyre going to have the two disney girls or three disney girls kind of feuding
553533 theres no feud theres nothing to feud about so why start a fight

553535 im not interested in being anybody but myself and im not here to replace anyone
553536 i think that shes a wonderful performer and of course its a compliment but i would like to take a different route

553548 it was pretty much the same with the last record
553549 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
553550 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
553551 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
553552 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
553553 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
553554 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
553555 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
553556 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
553557 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
553558 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front

553560 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens
553561 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
553562 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
553563 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music its sort of this big empowerment thing
553564 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre jelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
553565 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names

553594 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
553595 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

553601 survey work confirms our earlier estimate that over 1 000 000 iraqi citizens have died as a result of the conflict which started in 2003 we now estimate that the death toll between march 2003 and august 2007 is likely to have been of the order of 1 033 000 if one takes into account the margin of error associated with survey data of this nature then the estimated range is between 946 000 and 1 120 000
553602 the revolution may not be televised but it will be up loaded
553603 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
553604 instead of saying we are building on the achievements confronting new challenges we joined in the attack on our own ten years a fatal mistake we junked the tb tony blair policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place

553607 we need collective action to wipe out terrorism in the region
553608 i think its great to get as high as that
553609 at the beginning of the year a lot of people were asking me if my new setup after splitting with coach brad gilbert was going to work and questioning if it was the right thing for me to do
553610 i think my results showed that it took a little bit of time but that its paying off and im enjoying myself much more on court
553611 im much calmer and obviously my results have got better and better as the years gone on
553612 hes obviously got a great serve but ive read it well in the past today i did the same

553616 nee natuurlijk niet zo ziet jouw buik er toch ook niet uit
553617 his riches in christ jesus i think that this scripture speaks of the spiritual inheritance we have through our relationship with christ by grace through faith in jesus we have a righteousness that we could never attain on our own chris hit it on the nose when we give over all our worries and fears to god and admit that were unable to handle life without him every aspect of our lives will be blessed well if i read it correctly it is talking about gods glorious riches in christ jesus his son what are gods riches that can be offered to the philippians through jesus salvation is the big one that c0mes to mind how about peace of mind renewing of the mind and spirit grace and perhaps even worldly favor paul tended to be rather wordy and wasnt the easiest to understand a good question though made me think but when the fullness of the time had come god sent forth his son born of a woman born under the law to redeem those who were under the law that we might receive the adoption as sons
553618 i will be a father to you and you will be my sons and daughters says the lord almighty
553619 since we have these promises dear friends let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit perfecting holiness out of reverence for god
553620 i have been fulfilled by sharing my faith w another person and seeing that life touch it has brought a satisfaction that only those who do what i have done will ever
553621 you know church i was researching and found this statistic it is estimated that over 200 000 people die each day and go straight to hell

553641 debo confesarle que nunca segu una campa a electoral de los estados unidos con tanto inter s
553642 alguien que me ha sorprendido por su personalidad por su discurso por su forma de enfocar las cosas absolutamente diferente
553643 no deber a pronunciarme acerca de estas cosas por suerte no est el canciller jorge taiana pero que hoy sea candidato a la presidencia de los estados unidos un hombre de color revela por parte de la sociedad y el pueblo americano una vitalidad realmente sorprendente y admirable
553644 ser a un error tremendo que el nuevo contralor sea militante aprista

553647 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to
553648 sen obama says he wants energy independence but he doesnt support anything that serves that goal
553649 he believes every domestic energy source has a problem i believe every energy source needs to be part of the solution
553650 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think theyre cynical
553651 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks and planting doubts about people
553652 my name is hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am
553653 if i was presumptuous or taking this for granted i wouldnt be working this hard this week im beat
553654 weve got to make sure that the money thats going into nasa for basic research and development continues to go there
553655 government is too big and he wants to grow it taxes are too high and he wants to raise them congress spends too much and he proposes more were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit

553663 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
553664 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
553665 thats why today im announcing a two part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track
553666 across this country americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face unlike sen obama i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses
553667 is proposing to offset the cost of his emergency energy rebates over the next five years by enacting a windfall profits tax on big oil companies
553668 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognised clinical nomenclature is not being used
553669 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments
553670 the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women
553671 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help
553672 they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm
553673 if georgia continues provocative actions we will announce the recruitment of volunteers not only in the north ossetia but in the entire north caucasus and also carry out general mobilization in south ossetia
553674 its most serious concern about the escalation of tensions in south ossetia

553681 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
553682 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
553683 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
553684 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
553685 we take it very serious and hes being punished severely for it
553686 i want to know more about jesus because he died for me
553687 the reason most people are so miserable is that they cant stand themselves
553688 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
553689 he bart was in the process of trying to come away from this and was just involved with a sick sick man
553690 he was wanting help he did not understand his feelings and we certainly did not understand his feelings
553691 we dont know what happened the police told us bart was asleep he the attacker got in and strangled him to death with his hands and a dog leash
553692 i guess you never get over things of course but it has been almost seven years we still cry

553704 i just want to be able to keep us in games
553705 this is the second incident for both of these young men in the last year
553706 in my judgment their standing with the program is in question and they dont deserve to report with the rest of our team on sunday
553707 he has grown mature and has stepped out of the shadow of the defeat in athens whats more he is in very good form
553708 he just seems like such a nice guy like the kind of guy youd like to play golf with
553709 he would play this baseball video game and say you know dad your stuffs not very good
553710 he asked why are the yankees always so good every video game we get theyve got the best team i explained to him that they spend a lot of money on players if a player is really good they try to trade for him usually they have kind of an all star team
553711 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average
553712 i said ive been pitching in the big leagues about 10 years ive done this and that he said dad if you were any good the yankees would have traded for you
553713 the u m players always have said how much they enjoy heroes for kids and the strength and conditioning coach mike barwis said he wants to work with us on this next year

553728 besides there are more important things going on like the upcoming presidential election get out and vote it would be great to see history made this time around like seeing americas first african american president go obama
553729 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
553730 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
553731 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
553732 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
553733 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes
553734 as a washington wizards fan theres no way ill ever vote for anyone that lbj would consider

553745 those things in science labs that you use to heat your chemicals you hook them up to natural gas and you turn them on and a nice flame comes out the top
553746 was it dale did he pay you to do this what acting school are you from
553747 how he break into a school and decide to do a little late night science experiment and blow himself up
553748 no maam actually there was a car accident and a bunch of boxes full of bunsen burners went flying out of the delivery truck and landed on your husband
553749 and what happened did they take him to the hospital
553750 well he was with some of his colleagues and an entourage of chinese prostitutes
553751 apparently none of his coworkers knew that he was married

553753 according to his friends they hired the prostitutes as a birthday present for mr flaherty

553756 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times
553757 that clear direction has to be based on responsible economic management and responsible economic management remains anchored in a 22 billion budget surplus a buffer for the future
553758 these notices are in place for a reason to protect victorians
553759 we dont take the decision to ban products lightly but once we have made that decision we will do all that we can to ensure unsafe products are not sold in victoria
553760 traders need to be aware if you sell banned products in victoria you will be caught and prosecuted
553761 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world
553762 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
553763 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
553764 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view
553765 yes the economy is slowing yes we need to take the steam out of inflation but people talking recession are getting way ahead of the facts
553766 a closer look at some business reporting reveals evidence of a literary bent
553767 consider a recent report on merrill lynchs decision to sell off some parts and issue new stock to raise capital
553768 according to the report the company in a broad move to clean up its troubled balance sheet announced plans to sell a big slice of its toxic asset backed securities
553769 no dry economic prose here how pleased the merrill lynch executives must be of the descriptive reporting of their securities as toxic perhaps they can also entice the buyer to purchase some land near the love canal or in an area contaminated by kiln dust

553791 but in fact since the koran is considered by muslims to be the perfect word of allah both verses are sacred and true the later verse is better but the earlier verse cannot be wrong since allah is perfect this is the foundation of dualism both verses are right both sides of the contradiction are true in dualistic logic the circumstances govern which verse is used

553875 this is part of a systemic problem of the administration and i said im not going to take it anymore
553876 the disdain and uncooperative nature that this administration has shown toward congress is so egregious that i can no longer assume that it is simply bureaucratic incompetence or isolated mistakes rather i have come to the sad conclusion that this administration has intentionally obstructed congress rightful and constitutional duties
553877 there was a guy about 130 or 150 years ago who had several losses before he won
553878 i cant quite remember his name but he went on to become the president of the united states his first name was abraham what was his last name again
553879 then he said he had to look at a lot of samples that the fbi had prepared to duplicate the letter material
553880 n or should we ignore the possibility that a us biologist may become disgruntled or turn rogue while working in one of these labs
553881 the fbi must not let the death of bruce ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks

553892 i do not think the difference between participation and listening is a diplomatic quibble
553893 the bush administration is under severe international and domestic pressure to rein in its radical extremism which has led to catastrophes everywhere and might bring about even worse ones
553894 sending a non participant observer is a way to avoid negotiations and diplomacy while trying to fend off criticism
553895 setting up a diplomatic office is pretty much the same i think the office can also be used for subversion under the pretext of protecting human rights as in cuba
553896 nonetheless i think these steps should be encouraged though without illusions the american population by a large majority opposes threats against iran and favors diplomacy these small steps can perhaps open the way towards bringing the government towards public opinion

553920 as things stand perhaps to look at an inflation rate of 8 9 per cent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009
553921 you can get a much lower rate of inflation if there is confluence of favourable factors such as moderation in oil prices and so on otherwise if the oil prices remain at the prevailing rate that is best estimate for inflation
553922 as far as growth is concerned it will slow down it will slow down than what we have experienced in previous years but nevertheless i think we can still hope to have gdp growth of economy between 7 5 to 8 per cent

553963 ciertamente esto ha sido un golpe para la industria pero desafortunadamente los altercados en el terreno son parte de este deporte
553964 ciertamente esto no har que yo deje de asistir a los juegos de ligas menores
553965 creo que esto es simplemente buen b isbol en su forma m s pura
553966 no creo que el b isbol pueda transformar la conducta cultural pero s creo que el deporte ha hecho un trabajo maravilloso al poner un buen ejemplo cada d a
553967 considero importante ser muy severo en las medidas disciplinarias cuando ocurre algo que amenaza con demeritar ese aspecto del b isbol de las ligas menores
553968 no tengo palabras para agradecerles durante los ltimos d as visualic este momento y ahora que estoy parado aqu frente a ustedes no s c mo darles las gracias por todo y por todos esos a os que estuvieron ah apoy ndome junto con mi equipo
553969 este es uno de los d as m s incre bles de mi vida tengo que agradecer a todos aquellos que fueron mis compa eros en washington donde tuvimos la fortuna de conformar un gran grupo de jugadores pero especialmente de amigos
553970 en este largo camino tuve la oportunidad de conocer gente maravillosa que confi y crey en m y ahora lo nico que puedo decirles a todos ellos es gracias
553971 lo rescatable es la victoria el calor no nos permiti hacer mucho el clima no te deja estar l cido nos pega a los dos equipos ahora hay que seguir trabajando
553972 ambas partes est n negociando y creo que las conversaciones est n avanzando espero que podamos tenerlo resuelto el lunes
553973 creo que vamos a tener que forzarla la resoluci n creo que se ha llegado al punto en el que se necesitar n tomar algunas decisiones en nombre de los packers en nombre de brett y en favor de todos los aficionados
553974 de alguna manera hay que seguir trabajando me queda el aliciente de que los muchachos se comportaron a la altura aunque necesitan ser m s constantes en el trabajo para ir subiendo poco a poco
553975 falta trabajo sacar muchas conclusiones tenemos un mes por delante dos scrimmages uno contra potros de la uaem y contra la universidad veracruzana en este mes debemos mejorar mucho
553976 no puede ser as porque un operativo policiaco adem s de costoso implica mucho trabajo pues es laborar de siete de la ma ana a siete de la noche por eso los partidos contra aguilas blancas y burros blancos se jugar n en el estadio roberto
553977 hoy jugamos bien pero no hemos ganado nada lo importante fue la lucha de los jugadores en el terreno de juego el trabajo intenso fue en general un partido f cil porque nos paramos muy bien en la cancha y se nos presentaron las oportunidades pero sobre todo corrimos con suerte para anotar
553978 lo importante es que los delanteros estar n ah en el momento oportuno y el anotar les dar m s confianza para mejorar continuamente
553979 lo pasado tiene que quedar atr s y a partir del lunes comenzar de nuevo el trabajo de planeaci n para recibir al atlas de guadalajara el pr ximo s bado otro gran equipo pero sin duda el compromiso es no s lo jugar bien sino conseguir otro buen resultado
553980 haber sido compa ero de un fuera de serie como john elway es un verdadero orgullo agradezco a todos los aficionados de los broncos de denver y especialmente al coach mike shanahan por todos sus consejos
553981 me siento muy orgulloso de formar parte de la clase 2008 donde hay grandes hombres jugadores que dejaron cuerpo y alma con sus respectivos equipos felicidades a todos ustedes
553982 es un orgullo estar en el sal n de la fama regularmente los quarterbacks corredores llaman la atenci n en este deporte por eso el que un liniero ofensivo como yo haya sido electo representa mucho para m
553983 we have got a good response from students both within and outside delhi university students from all streams be it science commerce or humanities have shown interest students from the school of open learning have also applied we have received a few applications from senior citizens too
553984 the course will introduce students to the nuances of facing the camera body language voice modulation and knowledge of various software used
553985 this course will try to enhance a students personality it makes a big difference in the way you speak and present yourself so apart from news reading anchoring and radio jockeying a student can enter into event management live events like quizzes etc
553986 the college is in touch with the radio community to provide practical training to students
553987 immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy
553988 my mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument and id spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose thats rarely the case anymore now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages i get fidgety lose the thread begin looking for something else to do i feel as if im always dragging my wayward brain back to the text the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle my mind now expects to take in information the way the net distributes it in a swiftly moving stream of particles once i was a scuba diver in the sea of words now i zip along the surface like a guy on a jet ski
553989 what taylor did for the work of the hand google is doing for the work of the mind
553990 the rabbit has a charming face its private life is a disgrace

553997 fortunately the iaea has recently tried to regain its legal role as supporter of the rights of its members while supervising nuclear activities
553998 today because of the resistance of the iranian nation the issue is back to the agency and i officially announce that in our opinion the nuclear issue of iran is now closed and has turned into an ordinary agency matter
553999 of course iran has always been and will be prepared to have constructive talks with all parties
554000 unfortunately human rights are being extensively violated by certain powers especially by those who pretend to be their exclusive advocates
554001 setting up secret prisons abducting persons trials and secret punishments without any regard to due process extensive tapping of telephone conversations intercepting private mail have become commonplace and prevalent
554002 occupied under the pretext of overthrowing the dictator and the existence of weapons of mass destruction
554003 unfortunately we are witnessing the bitter truth that some powers do not value some nations or human beings and the only things that matter to them are themselves their political parties and their groups
554004 in their view human rights are tantamount to profits for their companies and their friends the rights and dignity of the american people are also being sacrificed for the selfish desires of those holding power
554005 for more than 60 years palestine as compensation for the loss they jews incurred during the war in europe has been under occupation of the illegal zionist regime
554006 the palestinian people have been displaced or are under heavy military pressure economic siege or are incarcerated under abhorrent conditions
554007 the occupiers are protected and praised while the innocent palestinians are subjected to political military and propaganda onslaughts
554008 the people of palestine are deprived of water electricity and medicine for the sin of asking for freedom and the government that was freely elected by the people is targeted
554009 leave the path of arrogance and satan to that of god
554010 the situation now is that turkey is dead and will never rise again because we have destroyed its moral strength the caliphate and islam
554011 i cannot imagine what the muslims would say if they heard the tales of the mediaeval ages and understood what the christian orators used to say in their hymns all our hymns even those which emerged before the 12th century emanated from one concept which was the cause of the crusades these hymns were filled with hatred towards the muslims due to the total ignorance of their religion as a result of those hymns and songs hatred against that religion became fixed in peoples minds and the erroneous ideas deeply rooted some of which are still carried nowadays everyone used to regard the muslims as polytheists disbelievers idol worshippers and apostates
554012 was it not because of the khilafah islam and the clergy that the turkish peasants fought and died for five centuries it is high time turkey looked after her own interests and ignored the indians and the arabs turkey should rid itself of leading the muslims
554013 we must put an end to anything which brings about any islamic unity between the sons of the muslims as we have already succeeded in finishing off the caliphate so we must ensure that there will never arise again unity for the muslims whether it be intellectual or cultural unity
554014 that kind of attitude goes against the american tradition of religious pluralism and inclusion
554015 i prefer someone who i know who has a solid grounding in my faith
554016 i admire the islam theres a lot of good principles in it but i just feel that my faith is probably a better spiritual guide
554017 i would probably have to say yes that the constitution established the united states of america as a christian nation
554018 it is a very dangerous and mistaken thing to say
554019 america is not a christian nation it is a multiethnic multifaith and multicultural nation and that is its glory
554020 the senator did not intend to assert that members of one religious faith or another have a greater claim to american citizenship over another
554021 america is a christian nation and it is hardly a controversial claim
554022 we appreciate the clarification but we would also state that respect for human life and dignity is rooted in islam and other faiths
554023 should be called on it and told he is wrong wrong wrong
554024 what a crock of theyre just looking for something to fill time and make some money marketing it as a hip americanized olympics
554025 orang yang mengerjakan solat adalah ia bermunajat mengadap dan merayu kepada tuhannya
554026 peliharalah kamu kerjakanlah dengan tetap dan sempurna pada waktunya segala solat fardu khasnya solat wusta solat asar dan berdirilah kerana allah dalam solat kamu dengan taat dan khusyuk
554027 jaminan berbaik baik di antara kita dengan mereka yang mendakwa dirinya orang islam ialah mengerjakan solat oleh itu sesiapa yang tidak solat sesungguhnya termasuklah dia dalam hukum orang kafir
554028 kemudian mereka yang taat digantikan oleh keturunan keturunan yang mencuaikan solat serta menurut hawa nafsu dengan melakukan maksiat maka mereka akan menghadapi azab di dalam neraka kecuali orang orang yang bertaubat dan beriman serta beramal soleh
554029 mencuaikan solat yang tersebut dalam ayat ini bukan maknanya mereka meninggalkan solat sama sekali tetapi maksudnya mereka mentakhirkan melengahkan solat sehingga keluar waktunya
554030 orang itu tidak solat zuhur melainkan selepas masuk waktu asar dan seterusnya mengenai waktu lain
554031 wahai orang orang beriman janganlah kamu dilalaikan oleh urusan harta benda kamu dan anak pinak kamu daripada mengingati allah dengan menjalankan perintahnya dan ingatlah sesiapa yang melakukan demikian mereka itulah orang yang rugi
554032 dan perintahkanlah keluargamu mengerjakan solat dan hendaklah engkau tekun sabar menunaikannya

554042 this may be the first generational election in recent history
554043 this is the first election where the split by age is so dramatic
554044 if youre obama youre encouraged but youre also scared to death republican pollster neil newhouse said of the recent polls
554045 your victory depends on a huge margin and turnout among 18 to 34 year olds who are historically the least likely to go to the polls
554046 if god had intended white and black birds to nest together he wouldnt of made two different kinds
554047 what is the wall street journal really trying to say when it talks about obama being more physically fit than the typical american and is it possible they are right
554048 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky

554054 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical
554055 i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
554056 for someone whos been in washington nearly 30 years hes got a pretty slim record on education and when he has taken a stand its been the wrong one
554057 im happy to put my record and ideas up against his any day
554058 i dont come out of central casting he said listing his youth name birth in hawaii and childhood in indonesia as things voters might not be used to
554059 what that means is that im sort of unfamiliar people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from what my values are
554060 so what i think has been an approach of the mccain campaign is to say hes risky
554061 they are very good at negative campaigns they are not so good at governing
554062 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama who has opposed every element of john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling affordable nuclear energy and gas tax relief for hardworking families
554063 there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bipartisan group i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions
554064 but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect
554065 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
554066 we have told the european countries that every country including iran has the right to engage in uranium enrichment and to possess nuclear power stations based on agreements
554067 what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day
554068 when one meditates the self is revealed as the underlying reality of everything as pure being consciousness and bliss
554069 we must have done incredibly good karma in our past lives to have been led to this place at this particular time do not think each of you have never met before or that we were not here before

554076 people treat you different when youre in between he was black white and she was white you know that most people thought it wasnt right i can still remember what she used to say it dont make any difference to me
554077 geez every time they show a sketch of someone wanted by the police its a black guy surely thats not right
554078 from talking to many in the african american community and even to white females many say they see nascars programs as window dressing theyre not really and honestly attacking the issue of diversity and inclusion
554079 can you explain why whites feel so threatened and imperiled
554080 become very detached from their racial and cultural identity as a group
554081 the white people have put the n n negroes in the back of the bus for years and if were not careful were gonna be in the back of the bus and theyre gonna be in the front
554082 the media residential segregation racial stereotypes and perception of group threat each contribute to whites underestimation of the size of the white population and the inflation of group size among racial minorities

554084 its strange to meet someone for the first time and have them know so much about me already
554085 the bluefluid surf racks are simple and quick to fit i had the racks and boards on the car in 5 minutes they worked perfectly on the weekend to carry 3 boards on our 2 door car we are about one and a half hours from the beach and most of that is freeway driving the boards stayed right where they should at 100km h
554086 because office buildings have air conditioners and in the wintertime it would be safer because maybe employees wouldnt have to travel in bad weather on certain days
554087 im not certain at this moment whether this would be our biggest reduction i would be pretty surprised if thats where we would get our energy efficiency savings
554088 i wish i could work ten hours a day for four days instead of ten hours a day every day
554089 before we go forward let me just pull this card out and let you know that i am a doctor i have a ph d in neurology that which is i dont but kirsten does

554097 while were seeing some high profile cutbacks like starbucks and don smallgoods were not yet seeing major job losses
554098 we didnt want to come out and pour fuel on the flames but i think its got to a point where we have to make some sort of response
554099 everybodys crying today its the same every day it never stops i wish i could close my eyes and not wake up and then i wouldnt hear it any more
554100 it is commonly accepted that a pig has the intelligence of a three year old child
554101 we only had enough money to pay for a weeks worth of air time in the capital cities
554102 but the overwhelming public support means we are now in our fourth week and i dont know how long its going to last
554103 ronnie is not allowed to speak to his nearest and dearest while he is in rehab he and jo still have major issues to resolve but jo knows there is no point in even trying to talk to ronnie until he is sober
554104 i love my wife but i have a girlfriend and i love her too
554105 he is being treated for everything he is having open therapy sessions and explained he has a wife and a girlfriend and that he loves them both its very strange but its just how he sees it hes looking a lot better and is very upbeat
554106 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times
554107 that clear direction has to be based on responsible economic management and responsible economic management remains anchored in a 22 billion budget surplus a buffer for the future
554108 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world
554109 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
554110 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
554111 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view
554112 yes the economy is slowing yes we need to take the steam out of inflation but people talking recession are getting way ahead of the facts
554113 ad inizio della stagione beh house e wilson sono arrivati ad un punto mai raggiunto prima e riparare questamicizia spero sia una cosa godibile da vedere

554123 contract that creates an additional paid holiday eid al fitr a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
554124 union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
554125 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
554126 if this holiday is that important to them make them take it off instead of christmas day and allow all workers to be off labor day most american families have some type of function on labor day
554127 it says union leadership made this request makes you wonder who runs the union i guess they are already working on a plan to replace memorial day that means nothing to the muslims so why should we have the right to celebrate it labor day commemorates the plight of workers and the struggle of labor unions to improve working conditions for american workers the muslims will not stop until all of our rights and laws are changed to accommodate their beliefs this will be a new america but it will be their america
554128 diversity is one of the strengths of our union we may come from different countries and speak different languages but what unites us is the belief that by standing together we can better advance our interests
554129 the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
554130 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
554131 this is america founded by the blood of our forefathers and should not be challenged by somalians hispanics or any other immigrants if they come to america they need to learn our language and our ways they can practice their culture in private if they so please but not shove it down our throats would they let us go there and change there country i have banned tysons products from my home for years because of the illegals they were hiring i am sorry for the producers that are supplying them but tysons has once again crossed the line with the american people labor day was here long before tysons what holiday will be next to be taken away and replaced to accommodate an immigrant this stinks worse than the plant
554132 disgusting appalling horrifying there just arent enough words to describe this situation there will never be another tyson product in my home ever bedford county and the rest of the nation needs to take notice is this what we are coming to

554139 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times

554143 they gave pledges that we would be able to report without restrictions that we would be able to travel anywhere in china and uplink anywhere in china the same conditions as had applied in previous olympic games and patently that is not happening

554410 no nos gusta que de juana est en la calle nos repugna somos mejores porque acatamos escrupulosamente la ley y no toleraremos el menor atisbo de menosprecio a las v ctimas
554411 siempre ha tenido una actitud de desaf o al estado de derecho y a la democracia aunque ahora se acoja a los beneficios que le da precisamente vivir en un estado de derecho
554412 en el futuro las sentencias condenatorias de personajes como de juana establezcan con toda claridad que cuando cumplan la condena no podr n vivir al lado de las v ctimas para evitar un doble sufrimiento a stas
554413 cuando la mayor preocupaci n de los espa oles es el tema econ mico
554414 pueda aportar en positivo respetando el dolor de las v ctimas
554415 las medidas de excepci n que el psoe toma contra i aki de juana y contra el resto de presos pol ticos vascos
554416 la dispersi n de presos los intentos de embargar los bienes de sus familiares la negaci n continua de los derechos m nimos que les corresponden o las condenas de por vida
554417 el nuevo acuerdo en lucha antiterrorista estar listo en septiembre
554418 ahora lo que toca es comprobar si el gobierno ha rectificado y si es as nosotros le apoyaremos como dije tras mi reuni n con el presidente del gobierno
554419 nuestra intenci n es que el pacto sea una realidad en septiembre y lo presentemos en la cortes ese mismo mes los aspectos m s importantes sobre los que estamos trabajando son que los terroristas no puedan vivir cerca de sus v ctimas y sobre todo que los etarras abonen las indemnizaciones correspondientes a sus v ctimas y no puedan eludir su responsabilidad civil
554420 meses atr s fui tildado de catastrofista y antipatriota por decir simplemente la verdad
554421 lo que ocurre hoy es que la gente ha visto la evidencia de ese enga o y adem s comprueba la par lisis del gobierno ante la crisis
554422 tan s lo ha enga ado y ahora gobierna a base de ocurrencias porque no sabe hacer otra cosa
554423 esto va a ir a peor y vamos a pasar unos meses o unos a os muy dif ciles
554424 la situaci n econ mica es peor de lo que preve amos todos
554425 en aquel momento honestamente lo pensaba as con los datos que ten amos pero siempre dije que era exagerado si por crisis entendemos recesi n
554426 desde hace dos meses hay algunos datos radicalmente diferentes como la subida del petr leo o de los tipos de inter s que nos pueden dar la idea de que la situaci n econ mica es peor de la que preve amos todos nosotros pens bamos que iba a ir algo m s lento y al final ha ido m s r pido
554427 si no nos da m s sorpresas el petr leo si no hay otras variables con impacto negativo pensamos que vamos a tener una situaci n de muy bajo crecimiento o crecimiento plano en los pr ximos trimestres pero no estamos pensando en una recesi n
554428 si los precios del petr leo se estabilizan a partir de septiembre deber amos empezar a ver una ca da de la inflaci n a fin de a o deber a estar en el entorno de 4 o incluso por debajo y en europa cerca del 3 el bce est m s preocupado por las expectativas de inflaci n y esa evoluci n afectar tambi n a su reflexi n eso nos permitir pensar que la estabilidad de tipos puede producirse pero son decisiones que el bce adoptar de acuerdo con su estrategia de pol tica monetaria
554429 yo siempre v esta declaraci n m s bien como una ambici n que como un an lisis t cnico
554430 hay que gastar mejor el dinero p blico y bajar impuestos a los que crean empleo
554431 ahora tiene que volver a lograr la confianza perdida en el exterior respecto a su capacidad productora
554432 dinamice la econom a del pa s bajando la carga de impuestos a quienes tienen la capacidad de producir empleo gastando desde las administraciones p blicas lo justo y gast ndolo mejor defendiendo lo intereses de las empresas espa olas fuera y haciendo un pa s m s atractivo y con capacidad para competir con una industria creativa y puntera ya que no podemos hacerlo con el petr leo y la mano de obra barata
554433 el principal problema es que nos financian desde fuera y ya no tenemos la capacidad de obtener esa financiaci n barata demostrando capacidad de crear nada
554434 estrat gico para la econom a y la movilidad de los ciudadanos de baleares
554435 mejorar y crear la atm sfera con un pa s tan pr ximo como es venezuela y la mejor garant a es tener buenas relaciones con esas autoridades
554436 as lo hicimos en argentina con las aerol neas y ahora con el banco santander
554437 c mo sentar a a los espa oles que se vendiese el banco de espa a a cualquier persona
554438 nadie puede decir que se le fuerza al banco santander a perder algo que hab a decidido sacar de su patrimonio
554439 a los 100 d as de gobierno les pondr a de fondo
554440 la sociedad se resiste a aceptar la vuelta a su seno de quien la trat de manera despiadada y no se ha arrepentido
554441 la justicia ha hecho lo que estaba en su mano para que sin negarse a s misma el etarra pague por sus cr menes y debe hacerle pagar las indemnizaciones fijadas en la condena
554442 en el caso de de juana hay indicios de un delito de alzamiento de bienes para evitar que se rescate parte de ese dinero con el importe de un piso que fue de su madre es de justicia investigarlo y si se confirma el intento de fraude impedirlo
554443 lo que no est en manos de la justicia es impedir que un condenado por terrorismo pueda habitar tras haber cumplido la sentencia en cualquier lugar donde tambi n residen v ctimas de la organizaci n terrorista existe una posibilidad legal de incluir en la condena una cl usula de alejamiento de sus propias v ctimas los que critican al gobierno y a la justicia por el caso de juana olvidan o no quieren ver que desde 2005 muchas condenas a terroristas ya incluyen el alejamiento de sus v ctimas
554444 psoe y pp negocian una reforma legal para que ese alejamiento se incluya siempre en las condenas por determinados actos terroristas es el camino correcto el cap tulo de juana debe cerrarse y esperar que no se repita
554445 las autoridades no generen expectativas que la ley no puede cumplir t cnicamente a de juana no se le puede imponer ninguna nueva medida restrictiva de su residencia o de movimiento el dolor de las v ctimas que se crucen con l por la calle es desde ayer impune
554446 la respuesta que merece este fracaso del estado de derecho un asesino sin rehabilitar est en la calle veinticinco asesinatos saldados con una pena rid cula y decenas de v ctimas nuevamente golpeadas debe tener mucho m s calado y compromete a los principales partidos mucho m s all de las concretas medidas que acordaron rajoy y zapatero en la moncloa
554447 el gobierno y el parlamento saben que hay una demanda social de justicia que se corresponde adem s con un diagn stico que exhibe la insuficiencia del sistema penal ya no hay excusas para mantener al estado con una mano atada a la espalda en la lucha contra el terrorismo y la delincuencia
554448 a estas alturas el gobierno deber a haber reunido ya el consenso suficiente para presentar en el parlamento iniciativas que proh ban de manera efectiva que se sigan empleando nombres de etarras en el callejero que obliguen a los asesinos a indemnizar realmente a sus v ctimas que impidan a un terrorista que sea vecino de personas a las que la banda ha arruinado la vida o que eviten que se excarcele alegremente a quienes no se hayan arrepentido de sus abyectos cr menes
554449 si hoy sas y otras cuestiones estuvieran resueltas las risas de de juana y el homenaje que ayer le rindieron los proetarras hubieran resultados menos dolorosos
554450 mientras el asesino se presentaba horas despu s de salir de prisi n como
554451 el tard o reconocimiento de la realidad de las v ctimas ha terminado por propiciar situaciones de oprobio que el estado de derecho debe esmerarse en prevenir con mayor diligencia pero ni las fallas del sistema ni las insuficiencias en la actuaci n de las instituciones justificar an un cuestionamiento de la eficacia de la lucha contra eta que pueda ser esgrimido como una falsa victoria por quienes a n contin an matando y quienes les amparan
554452 esta nueva estafa a las v ctimas a todas y cada una de las v ctimas de la barbarie etarra que hoy vuelven a sangrar al asistir a tama a iniquidad no es ni puede ser gratuita
554453 se nos dir que as es la ley y que nada puede hacer el poder ejecutivo para impedir la liberaci n de esta basura que ha recurrido a la falsificaci n para redimir condena pero se estar faltando a la verdad
554454 el caso de juana demuestra que no hay dos caminos derrota con los mecanismos del estado de derecho o negociaci n para acabar con eta o se derrota al terrorismo o se le dan opciones para sobrevivir
554455 a n de mala gana la ley es nuestra fuerza moral reclamar que se vaya m s all s lo favorece al terror
554456 en las ltimas horas espa a entera ha sido un agraviado grito de protesta e indignaci n por la puesta en libertad tras cumplir la condena que le impusieron los jueces del singular etarra y m ltiple asesino ignacio de juana chaos ha vuelto a cundir el esc ndalo que es nuestro modo de no enfrentarnos a la realidad
554457 el asesino de juana podr brindar de nuevo con champ n por el dolor de sus v ctimas
554458 las principales deficiencias de un ejecutivo superado por las circunstancias
554459 es lamentable que ante una crisis en toda regla la nica respuesta sean ocurrencias como las bombillas o los 400 euros que rajoy califica como aut nticas
554460 el l der de la oposici n acierta de lleno cuando exige una defensa activa de nuestras empresas en el extranjero en relaci n con el lamentable comportamiento de hugo ch vez hacia el banco santander a los pocos d as de ser recibido en espa a con toda cordialidad
554461 en poco tiempo rodr guez zapatero ha dilapidado la confianza de muchos electores con una p sima gesti n de la crisis econ mica y una sensaci n general de pasividad
554462 mariano rajoy logra consolidar una alternativa que desde el congreso de valencia deja atr s los problemas internos para ocuparse de aquello que importa realmente a los ciudadanos
554463 ch vez da as un paso m s esta vez en el mercado financiero en su camino por nacionalizar los negocios estrat gicos del pa s sin embargo la noticia no es buena para nadie pues contribuir a alimentar la desconfianza de los inversores extranjeros
554464 el segundo punto es si el gobierno espa ol conoc a las maniobras de ch vez no es precisamente un gesto de finura que ch vez anuncie sus planes apenas una semana despu s de su visita a espa a
554465 una oportunidad nica para reforzar los v nculos pol ticos culturales econ micos y de cooperaci n que hist ricamente unen a nuestro pa s con esas naciones hermanas
554466 con m xico como referente espa a est llamada a recuperar el tradicional papel de mediador privilegiado entre la uni n europea e iberoam rica que se ha debilitado en los ltimos a os como consecuencia de los gui os hechos por el ejecutivo socialista al presidente venezolano hugo ch vez y sus ac litos en bolivia o ecuador pero sobre todo por el velado apoyo al r gimen de fidel castro con la consiguiente marginaci n a los disidentes cubanos
554467 puede ser clave para enmendar en la medida de lo posible los errores cometidos hasta la fecha en materia de pol tica exterior
554468 para retomar este liderazgo espa a debe seguir siendo para estos pa ses hermanos un referente inequ voco en la defensa de las libertades democr ticas y de los derechos humanos

554473 we have recovered 33 bodies after completing overnight rescue and relief operations
554474 if the litigation proceeded and the trial court ruled on hdnets request for a declaration of coutures obligations under the zuffa contract that ruling would have a critical impact on the arbitration and in fact could destroy zuffas right to a meaningful arbitration by deciding issues subject to the arbitration the trial court abused its discretion in denying zuffas motion to stay the litigation pending the arbitration in nevada between zuffa and couture
554475 our project is sort of unique because instead of having a construction company build 40 towers in a farm field each member city will have a turbine in town
554476 these wont be as big as some of the ones you see on wind farms
554477 its showing a commitment on the part of mmpa and the community that they really do want to build a green power solution
554478 its a visual symbol of conservation efforts and green power
554479 this brings it close to home as opposed to a theoretical windmill farm that may be several hundred miles away

554481 to ibm cloud computing is much more than the normal evolution of a data center
554482 customs agents must have the ability to conduct even highly intrusive searches when there is reason to suspect criminal or terrorist activity but suspicionless searches of americans laptops and similar devices go too far congress should not allow this gross violation of privacy

554490 my lord the order of the phoenix intends to move harry potter from his current place of safety on saturday next at nightfall
554491 dawlish the auror let slip that potter will not be moved until the thirtieth the night before the boy turns seventeen
554492 my source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail this must be it no doubt a confundus charm has been placed upon dawlish it would not be the first time he is known to be susceptible
554493 i assure yaxley the auror office will play no further part in the protection of harry potter the order believes that we have infiltrated the ministry
554494 dawlish believes an entire party of aurors will be used to transfer the boy
554495 the place according to the source has been given every protection that the order and ministry together could provide i think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there my lord unless of course the ministry has fallen before next saturday which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest
554496 my lord i have good news on that score i have with difficulty and after great effort succeeded in placing an imperius curse upon pius thicknesse
554497 but thicknesse is only one man scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before i act one failed attempt on the ministers life will set me back a long way
554498 yes my lord that is true but you know as head of the department of magical law enforcement thicknesse has regular contact not only with the minister himself but also with the heads of all the other ministry departments it will i think be easy now that we have such a high ranking official under our control to subjugate the others and then they can all work together to bring scrimgeour down
554499 as long as our friend thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest
554500 at any rate it remains unlikely that the ministry will be mine before next saturday if we cannot touch the boy at his destination then it must be done while he travels
554501 we now have several people planted within the department of magical transport if potter apparates or uses the floo network we shall know immediately
554502 the order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the ministry they mistrust everything to do with the place
554503 he will have to move in the open easier to take by far
554504 i shall attend to the boy in person there have been too many mistakes where harry potter is concerned some of them have been my own that potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs
554505 i have been careless and so have been thwarted by luck and chance those wreckers of all but the best laid plans but i know better now i understand those things that i did not understand before i must be the one to kill harry potter and i shall be
554506 have i not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet
554507 i understand better now i shall need for instance to borrow a wand from one of you before i go to kill potter
554508 lets see lucius i see no reason for you to have a wand anymore
554509 i have given you your liberty lucius is that not enough for you but i have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late what is it about my presence in your home that displaces you lucius
554510 why do the malfoys look so unhappy with their lot is my return my rise to power not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years
554511 it is an honor to have you here in our familys house there can be no higher pleasure
554512 no higher pleasure even compared with the happy event that i hear has taken place in your family this week
554513 im talking about your niece bellatrix and yours lucius and narcissa she has just married the werewolf remus lupin you must be so proud
554514 we narcissa and i have never set eyes on our sister since she married the mudblood this brat has nothing to do with either of us nor any beast she marries
554515 many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time
554516 you must prune yours must you not to keep it healthy cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest
554517 and in your family so in the world we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain
554518 for those of you who do not know we are joined here tonight by charity burbage who until recently taught at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry
554519 yes professor burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about muggles how they are not so different from us
554520 not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of wizarding children last week professor burbage wrote an impassioned defense of mudbloods in the
554521 what do you see when you look in the mirror
554522 i i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks
554523 such a long full life im sure my book will be the first of very very many
554524 oh when youve been a journalist as long as i have working to a deadline is second nature i knew that the wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and i wanted to be the first to meet that need
554525 skeeters book contains less fact than a chocolate frog card
554526 darling dodgy i remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights bless him completely gaga seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of lake windermere kept telling me to watch out for trout
554527 you know as well as i do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of galleons a refusal to hear the word no and a nice sharp quick quotes quill people were queuing to dish the dirt on dumbledore anyway not everyone thought he was so wonderful you know he trod on an awful lot of important toes but old dodgy doge can get off his high hippogriff because ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth
554528 now come off it betty im not giving away all the highlights before anybodys bought the book
554529 but i can promise that anybody who still thinks dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening lets just say that nobody hearing him rage against you know who would have dreamed that he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth and for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance he wasnt exactly broad minded when he was younger yes albus dumbledore had an extremely murky past not to mention that very fishy family which he worked so hard to keep hushed up
554530 oh aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap
554531 no no im talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats worse even than the muggle maiming father dumbledore couldnt keep either of them quiet anyway they were both charged by the wizengamot no its the mother and the sister that intrigued me and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness but as i say youll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details all i can say now is its no wonder dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken
554532 although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements as i reveal in chapter sixteen ivor dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragons blood when dumbledore borrowed his papers
554533 im afraid those who go dewy eyed over dumbledores spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell or perhaps a dungbomb very dirty business indeed all ill say is dont be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend after theyve read my book people may be forced to conclude that grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly
554534 i devote an entire chapter to the whole potter dumbledore relationship its been called unhealthy even sinister again your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story but there is no question that dumbledore took an unnatural interest in potter from the word go whether that was really in the boys best interests well well see its certainly an open secret that potter has had a most troubled adolescence
554535 poor potter has few real friends and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life the triwizard tournament i am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real harry potter
554536 well i dont want to say too much its all in the book but eyewitnesses inside hogwarts castle saw potter running away from the scene moments after dumbledore fell jumped or was pushed potter later gave evidence against severus snape a man against whom he has a notorious grudge is everything as it seems that is for the wizarding community to decide once theyve read my book
554537 ive decided i dont believe a word of it were staying put were not going anywhere
554538 i was awake half the night thinking it all over and i believe its a plot to get the house
554539 a plot to get this house are you actually as stupid as you look
554540 ive already got a house my godfather left me one so why would i want this one all the happy memories
554541 and weve been through this about a hundred times already
554542 once im seventeen the protective charm that keeps me safe will break and that exposes you as well as me the order is sure voldemort will target you whether to torture you to try and find out where i am or because he thinks by holding you hostage id come and try to rescue you
554543 youve got to go into hiding and the order wants to help youre being offered serious protection the best there is
554544 well then why cant they protect us it seems to me that as innocent victims guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man we ought to qualify for government protection
554545 all right lets say for the sake of argument we accept this protection i still dont see why we cant have that kingsley bloke
554546 kingsley is protecting the mug i mean your prime minister
554547 but hestia jones and dedalus diggle are more than up to the job
554548 these accidents arent accidents the crashed and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news people are disappearing and dying and hes behind it voldemort ive told you this over and over again he kills muggles for fun even the fogs theyre caused by dementors and if you cant remember what they are ask your son
554549 because once im seventeen all of them death eaters elementors maybe even inferi which means dead bodies enchanted by a dark wizard will be able to find you and will certainly attack you and if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards i think youll agree you need help
554550 they will torture and kill you like they did my parents
554551 for the first time in your life youre talking sense
554552 theyll be here in about five minutes he said and when one of the dursleys replied he left the room
554553 its really good of you to do this theyre through here my aunt and uncle and cousin
554554 i see you are packed and ready excellent the plan as harry has told you is a simple one
554555 we shall be leaving before harry does due to the danger of using magic in your house harry being still underage it could provide the ministry with an excuse to arrest him we shall be driving say ten miles or so before disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you you know how to drive i take it
554556 know how to of course i ruddy well know how to drive
554557 very clever of you sir very clever i personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs
554558 i thought mad eye was going to come and take me by side along apparition
554559 we are attempting to time your departure from the house with your familys disapparition harry thus the charm breaks the moment you all head for safety
554560 hes off with some of your lot isnt he right dudley lets get in the car you heard the man were in a hurry
554561 dont these people realize what youve been through what danger you are in the unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti voldemort movement
554562 they think im a waste of space actually but im used to
554563 s such a lovely b boy s saying thank you
554564 he only said he didnt think harry was a waste of space
554565 yea but coming from dudley thats like i love you
554566 good luck i hope we meet again the hopes of the wizarding world rest upon your shoulders
554567 oh im sure we shall end up the best of chums
554568 dont you want to take a last look at the place
554569 kingsley i thought you were looking after the muggle prime minister
554570 im sorry you couldnt be there harry it was very quiet
554571 all right all right well have time for a cozy catch up later
554572 as dedalus probably told you we had to abandon plan a pius thicknesse has gone over which gives us a big problem hes made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the floo network place a portkey here or apparate in or out all done in the name of your protection to prevent you know who getting in at you absolutely pointless seeing as your mothers charm does that already what hes really done is to stop you getting out of here safely
554573 second problem youre underage which means youve still got the trace on you
554574 the charm that detects magical activity around under seventeens the way the ministry finds out about underage magic if you or anyone around you casts a spell to get you out of here thicknesse is going to know about it and so will the death eaters
554575 we cant wait for the trace to break because the moment you turn seventeen youll lose all the protection your mother gave you in short pius thicknesse thinks hes got you cornered good and proper
554576 were going to use the only means of transport left to us the only ones the trace cant detect because we dont need to cast spells to use them brooms thestrals and hagrids motorbike
554577 now your mothers charm will only break under two conditions when you come of age or
554578 you no longer call this place home you and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight in the full understanding that youre never going to live together again correct
554579 so this time when you leave therell be no going back and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range were choosing to break it early because the alternative is waiting for you know who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen
554580 the one thing weve got on our side is that you know who doesnt know were moving you tonight weve leaked a fake trail to the ministry they think youre not leaving until the thirtieth however this is you know who were dealing with so we cant rely on him getting the date wrong hes bound to have a couple of death eaters patrolling the skies in this general area just in case so weve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them they all look like they could be the place were going to hide you theyve all got some connection with the order my house kingsleys place mollys auntie muriels you get the idea
554581 youll be going to tonkss parents once youre within the boundaries of the protective enchantments weve put on their house youll be able to use a portkey to the burrow any questions
554582 maybe they wont know which of the twelve secure houses im heading for at first but wont it be sort of obvious once
554583 i forgot to mention the key point fourteen of us wont be flying to tonkss parents there will be seven harry potters moving through the skies tonight each of them with a companion each pair heading for a different safe house
554584 if you think im going to let six people risk their lives
554585 imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky scrawny gits forever
554586 you cant do it if i dont cooperate you need me to give you some hair
554587 obviously theres no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate
554588 yeah thirteen of us against one bloke whos not allowed to use magic weve got no chance
554589 if it has to come to force then it will
554590 everyone heres overage potter and theyre all prepared to take the risk
554591 lets have no more arguments times wearing on i want a few of your hairs boy now
554592 with you know who out there and half the ministry on his side potter if were lucky hell have swallowed the fake bait and hell be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth but hed be mad not to have a death eater or two keeping an eye out its what id do they might not be able to get at you or this house while your mothers charm holds but its about to break and they know the rough position of the place our only chance is to use decoys even you know who cant split himself into seven
554593 ooh you look much tastier than crabbe and goyle harry
554594 oh you know what i mean goyles potion tasted like bogies
554595 as ive already told you you spineless worm any death eaters we run into will be aiming to capture potter not kill him dumbledore always said you know who would want to finish potter in person itll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about the death eatersll want to kill them
554596 those whose clothes are a bit roomy ive got smaller here
554597 and vice versa dont forget the glasses theres six pairs in the side pocket and when youre dressed theres luggage in the other sack
554598 the pairs will be as follows mundungus will be traveling with me by broom
554599 the other one george or fred or whoever you are youre with remus
554600 well be on the bike brooms an thestrals cant take me weight see not a lot o room on the seat with me on it though so youll be in the sidecar
554601 we think the death eaters will expect you to be on a broom
554602 snapes had plenty of time to tell them everything about you hes never mentioned before so if we do run into any death eaters were betting theyll choose one of the potters who looks at home on a broomstick all right then
554603 i make it three minutes until were supposed to leave
554604 an the last time yeh was on it harry i could fit yeh in one hand
554605 its got a few tricks up its sleeves now tha one was my idea
554606 im still not sure that was advisable and its certainly only to be used in emergencies
554607 everyone ready please i want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversions lost
554608 see you all in about an hour at the burrow on the count of three one two three
554609 hagrid weve got to go back weve got to go back
554610 i shouldnta tried ter repair it meself yehve got no room
554611 hagrid do the dragon fire thing again lets get out of here
554612 i think weve lost em harry i think weve done it
554613 somehow harry found his nose an inch from the dragon fire button he punched it with his wand free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air hurtling straight toward the ground
554614 hagrid the motorbike sped up sucked towards the earth face level with the handlebars harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer he was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it behind him came another scream
554615 the wifes seeing to him now how are you feeling anything else broken ive fixed your ribs your tooth and your arm im ted by the way ted tonks doras father
554616 that was a nasty crash you just had what happened anyway something go wrong with the bike arthur weasley overstretch himself again him and his muggle contraptions
554617 well we know our protective charms hold then dont we they shouldnt be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction
554618 blimey harry how did yeh get out o that i thought we were both goners
554619 it fell right beside you i picked it up and thats my wife youre shouting at
554620 weve got to get back to the burrow and find out then well be able to send you word or or tonks will once shes
554621 she knows her stuff shes been in plenty of tight spots with the aurors the portkeys through here
554622 its supposed to leave in three minutes if you want to take it
554623 harry you are the real harry what happened where are the others
554624 we were surrounded the moment we took off they knew it was tonight i dont know what happened to anyone
554625 ron and tonks should have been back first but they missed their portkey it came back without them
554626 should have been dad and freds they were supposed to be second you and hagrid were third and
554627 if they made it george and lupin aught to be back in about a minute
554628 what creature sat in the corner the first time that harry potter visited my office at hogwarts
554629 weve been betrayed voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan you might have been an impostor
554630 none of the order would have told voldemort we were moving tonight
554631 voldemort only caught up with me toward the end he didnt know which one i was in the beginning if hed been in on the plan hed have known from the start i was the one with hagrid
554632 i saw stan shunpike you know the bloke who was the conductor on the knight bus and i tried to disarm him instead of well he doesnt know what hes doing does he he must be imperiused
554633 harry the time for disarming is past these people are trying to capture and kill you at least stun if you arent prepared to kill
554634 we were hundreds of feet up stans not himself and if i stunned him and hed fallen hed have died the same as if id used avada kedavra expelliarmus saved me from voldemort two years ago
554635 and a great number of death eaters witnessed that happening forgive me but it was a very unusual move then under the imminent threat of death repeating it tonight in front of death eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal
554636 but the death eaters frankly most people would have expected you to attack back expelliarmus is a useful spell harry but the death eaters seem to think it is your signature move and i urge you not to let it become so
554637 i wont blast people out of my way just because theyre there
554638 i think so although theres no chance of replacing his ear not when its been cursed off
554639 the last words albus dumbledore spoke to the pair of us
554640 but somebody betrayed us they knew they knew it was tonight
554641 but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven harrys
554642 and we saw you know who as well he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly
554643 i saw him too he came after hagrid and me
554644 i couldnt understand why hed vanished but what made him change targets
554645 hermione theres obviously been a mass breakout which the ministry has hushed up traverss hood fell off when i cursed him hes supposed to be inside too but what happened to you remus wheres george
554646 he lost his hood during the chase sectumsempra was always a specialty of snapes i wish i could say id paid him back in kind but it was all i could do to keep george on the broom after he was injured he was losing so much blood
554647 i cant make it grow back not when its been removed by dark magic but it couldve been so much worse hes alive
554648 ill prove who i am kingsley after ive seen my son now back off if you know whats good for you
554649 pathetic with the whole wide world of ear related humor before you you go for
554650 youll be able to tell us apart now anyway mum
554651 ron and tonks should be back by now they didnt have a long journey auntie muriels not that far from here
554652 were still waiting for bill and fleur and mad eye and mundungus
554653 she wants me quite as much as she wants harry remus she tried very hard to kill me
554654 im going to have to get back to downing street i should have been there an hour ago
554655 it happened just after we broke out of the circle mad eye and dung were close by us they were heading north too
554656 and i wondered that too on the way back here because they seemed to be expecting us didnt they but mundungus cant have betrayed us they didnt know there would be seven harrys that confused them the moment we appeared and in case youve forgotten it was mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery why wouldnt he have told them the essential point i think dung panicked its as simple as that he didnt want to come in the first place but mad eye made him and you know who went straight for them it was enough to make anyone panic
554657 you know who acted exactly as mad eye expected him to
554658 mad eye said hed expect the real harry to be with the toughest most skilled aurors
554659 but still eet does not explain ow zey know we were moving arry tonight does eet somebody must ave been careless somebody let slip ze date to an outsider it is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze ole plan
554660 and let something slip i know they didnt mean to do it its not their fault
554661 weve got to trust each other i trust all of you i dont think anyone in this room would ever sell me to voldemort
554662 who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends
554663 the whole point of tonight was to get you here safely and thank goodness it worked
554664 there are a dozen places you might be now harry
554665 hes got no way of knowing which safe house youre in
554666 blimey harry after all we wen through ter get you here
554667 we can put her up with pidwidgeon and give her something to eat
554668 wait till it gets out yeh did it again harry
554669 escaped him fought him off when he was right on top of yeh
554670 it was my wand my wand acted of its own accord
554671 but thats impossible harry you mean that you did magic without meaning to you reacted instinctively
554672 the bike was falling i couldnt have told you where voldemort was but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him and it wasnt even a spell i recognized ive never made gold flames appear before
554673 when youre in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of
554674 you sought to help potter to help him escape me
554675 i swear i did not i believed a different wand would work
554676 i cannot understand the connection exists only between your two wands
554677 but it was supposed to have stopped your scar it wasnt supposed to do this anymore you mustnt let that connection open up again dumbledore wanted you to close your mind
554678 harry hes taking over the ministry and the newspapers and half the wizarding world dont let him inside your head too
554679 till youre seventeen youve still got the trace on you and we can plan here as well as anywhere cant we or
554680 dyou reckon you already know where the you know whats are
554681 she said she was saving it for when you got here
554682 that means i only need to stay here four days
554683 weve got to stay for the wedding theyll kill us if we miss it
554684 they havent got a clue and now you mention it i wanted to talk to you about that
554685 mums been trying to get it out of hermione and me what were off to do shell try you next so brace yourself dad and lupinve both asked as well but when we said dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us they dropped it not mum though shes determined
554686 ron and hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of hogwarts
554687 ron and hermione know about it and they want to come too
554688 well frankly i think arthur and i have a right to know and im sure mr and mrs granger would agree
554689 youre barely of age any of you its utter nonsense if dumbledore needed work doing he had the whole order at his command harry you must have misunderstood him probably he was telling you something he
554690 i should have realized well harry while weve still got you here you wont mind helping with the preparations for bill and fleurs wedding will you theres still so much to do
554691 i think mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning shell be able to delay you leaving
554692 someone else might kill off voldemort while shes holding us here making vol au vents
554693 and as there are around twenty of us that greatly dilutes the power of the fidelius charm twenty times as many opportunities for the death eaters to get the secret out of somebody we cant expect it to hold much longer
554694 but surely snape will have told the death eaters the address by now
554695 well mad eye set up a couple of curses against snape in case he turns up there again we hope theyll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place but we cant be sure it would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky
554696 but that doesnt mean much its keeping a lot quiet these days
554697 and they still havent called a hearing about all the underage magic i used escaping the death eaters
554698 because they know i had no choice or because they dont want me to tell the world voldemort attacked me
554699 the latter i think scrimgeour doesnt want to admit that you know who is as powerful as he is nor that azkabans seen a mass breakout
554700 isnt anyone at the ministry prepared to stand up to him
554701 terrified that they will be next to disappear their children the next to be attacked there are nasty rumors going around i for one dont believe the muggle studies professor at hogwarts resigned she hasnt been seen for weeks now meanwhile scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day i just hope hes working on a plan
554702 of course none of our guests are death eaters but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ave ad champagne
554703 exclaimed ron slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother
554704 why does my room have to be cleaned out harry and i are fine with it the way it is
554705 we are holding your brothers wedding here in a few days time young man
554706 no harry dear id much rather you helped arthur much out the chickens and hermione id be ever so grateful if youd change the sheets for monsieur and madame delacour you know theyre arriving at eleven tomorrow morning
554707 but er ted tonks sent me most of what was left of siriuss bike and er im hiding thats to say keeping it in here fantastic stuff theres an exhaust gaskin as i believe its called the most magnificent battery and itll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work im going to try and put it all back together again when mollys not i mean when ive got time
554708 even if the killing curse missed mad eye still fell about a thousand feet
554709 fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand
554710 well all right if you want him to be dead
554711 the death eaters probably tidied up after themselves thats why no ones found him
554712 like barty crouch turned into a bone and buried in hagrids front garden
554713 its just so awf ful isnt it r right after dumbledore i j just n never imagined mad eye dying somehow he seemed so tough
554714 but you know what hed say to us if he was here
554715 hed tell us to learn from what happened to him and what ive learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit mundungus
554716 just trying to decide which ones to take with us
554717 i forgot well be hunting down voldemort in a mobile library
554718 i wonder will we need to translate runes its possible i think wed better take it to be safe
554719 i know you said after dumbledores funeral that you wanted to come with me
554720 were coming with you that was decided months ago years really
554721 ive been packing for days so were ready to leave at a moments notice which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic not to mention smuggling whole stock of polyjuice potion right under rons mums nose
554722 ive also modified my parents memories so that theyre convinced theyre really called wendell and monica wilkins and that their lifes ambition is to move to australia which they have now done
554723 assuming i survive our hunt for the horcruxes ill find mum and dad and lift the enchantment if i dont well i think ive cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy wendell and monica wilkins dont know that theyve got a daughter you see
554724 didnt realize that ron and i know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you well we do ron show harry what youve done
554725 nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules
554726 ill explain it back in my room the smells getting to me
554727 once weve left the ghouls going to come and live down here in my room
554728 i think hes really looking forward to it well its hard to tell because all he can do is moan and drool but he nods a lot when you mention it anyway hes going to be me with spattergroit good eh
554729 look when we three dont turn up at hogwarts again everyones going to think hermione and i must be with you right which means the death eaters will go straight for our families to see if theyve got information on where you are
554730 but hopefully itll look like ive gone away with mum and dad a lot of muggle borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment
554731 we cant hide my whole family itll look too fishy and they cant all leave their jobs
554732 so were going to put out the story that im seriously ill with spattergroit which is why i cant go back to school if anyone comes calling to investigate mum or dad can show them the ghoul in my bed covered in pustules spattergroits really contagious so theyre not going to want to go near him it wont matter that he cant say anything either because apparently you cant once the fungus has spread to your uvula
554733 and your mum and dad are in on this plan
554734 dad is he helped fred and george transform the ghoul mum well youve seen what shes like she wont accept were going till were gone
554735 ginnys probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring
554736 i dunno why the delacours have got to come two days before the wedding
554737 fleurs sisters a bridesmaid she needs to be here for the rehearsal and shes too young to come on her own
554738 is where were going after we leave here i know you said you wanted to go to godrics hollow first harry and i understand why but well shouldnt we make the horcruxes our priority
554739 if we knew where any of the horcruxes were id agree with you
554740 dont you think theres a possibility that voldemorts keeping a watch on godrics hollow
554741 he might expect you to go back and visit your parents graves once youre free to go wherever you like
554742 he said in his note he was going to destroy it didnt he
554743 yes but were still going to have to try and trace the real locket arent we
554744 i didnt think there were any books on horcruxes in the library
554745 dumbledore removed them all but he he didnt destroy them
554746 how in the name of merlins pants have you managed to get your hands on those horcrux books
554747 they were still library books even if dumbledore had taken them off the shelves anyway if he
554748 i just did a summoning charm you know accio and they zoomed out of dumbledores study window right into the girls dormitory
554749 right after we agreed wed leave school and go and look for the horcruxes when i went back upstairs to get my things it it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them the better it would be and i was alone in there so i tried and it worked they flew straight in through the open window and i i packed them
554750 i cant believe dumbledore would have been angry its not as though were going to use the information to make a horcrux is it
554751 this is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a horcrux its a horrible book really awful full of evil magic i wonder when dumbledore removed it from the library if he didnt do it until he was headmaster i bet voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here
554752 why did he have to ask slughorn how to make a horcrux then if hed already read that
554753 he only approached slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven
554754 dumbledore was sure riddle already knew how to make a horcrux by the time he asked slughorn about them i think youre right hermione that could easily have been where he got the information
554755 the more horrible they seem and the less i can believe that he actually made six it warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it and thats just by making one horcrux
554756 youve got to really feel what youve done theres a footnote apparently the pain of it can destroy you i cant see voldemort attempting it somehow can you
554757 so does it say how to destroy horcruxes in that book
554758 because it warns dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them from all that ive read what harry did to riddles diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a horcrux
554759 oh well lucky weve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs then
554760 i was wondering what we were going to do with them
554761 it has to be something so destructive that the horcrux cant repair itself
554762 our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom and theyre all dangerous to carry around with you thats a problem were going to have to solve though because ripping smashing or crushing a horcrux wont do the trick youve got to put it beyond magical repair
554763 but even if we wreck the thing it lives in
554764 why cant the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else
554765 because a horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being
554766 look if i picked up a sword right now ron and ran you through with it i wouldnt damage your soul at all
554767 which would be a real comfort to me im sure
554768 it should be actually but my point is that whatever happens to your body your soul will survive untouched
554769 but its the other way round with a horcrux the fragment of soul inside it depends on its container its enchanted body for survival it cant exist without it
554770 and once the diary was properly destroyed the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did flushing it away but obviously it came back good as new
554771 the bit of soul in that diary was possessing ginny wasnt it how does that work then
554772 while the magical container is still intact the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object i dont mean holding it for too long its nothing to do with touching it
554773 i mean close emotionally ginny poured her heart out into that diary she made herself incredibly vulnerable youre in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the horcrux
554774 im so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering
554775 im sure you all need your rest but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and i was under the impression that you had agreed to help
554776 except without the job satisfaction the sooner this weddings over the happier ill be
554777 then well have nothing to do except find horcruxes itll be like a holiday wont it
554778 we are most honored at the approaching union of our two families let me present my wife apolline
554779 and of course you ave met my leetle daughter gabrielle
554780 madame delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice gabrielle followed her elder sister around trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid french on the downside the burrow was not built to accommodate so many people mr and mrs weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room having shouted down monsieur and madame delacours protests and insisted they take their bedroom gabrielle was sleeping with fleur in percys old room and bill would be sharing with charlie his best man once charlie arrived from romania opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent and it was in desperation that harry ron and hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house still wont leave us alone
554781 wed better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow to put up the tent for the wedding
554782 millamants magic marquees theyre very good bills escorting them youd better stay inside while theyre here harry i must say it does complicate organizing a wedding having all these security spells around the place
554783 i didnt mean well your safetys much more important actually ive been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday harry seventeen after all its an important day
554784 really mrs weasley just a normal dinner would be fine its the day before the wedding
554785 oh well if youre sure dear ill invite remus and tonks shall i and how about hagrid
554786 voldemort i think hes somewhere abroad looking for gregorovitch it didnt look like anywhere in britain
554787 although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep
554788 hes got something to do with quidditch theres some connection but i cant think what it is
554789 dragomir gorgovitch chaser transferred to the chudley cannons for a record fee two years ago record holder for most quaffle drops in a season
554790 although they were only around a foot away there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him at least until they poked him in the eye
554791 heres your present unwrap it up here its not for my mothers eyes
554792 itd pure gold twelve fail safe ways to charm witches explains everything you need to know about girls if only id had this last year id have known exactly how to get rid of lavender and i wouldve known how to get going with well fred and george gave me a copy and ive learned a lot youd be surprised its not all about wandwork either
554793 arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth harry
554794 he had to leave early for work but hell be back for dinner thats our present on top
554795 its traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age
554796 im afraid that one isnt new like rons it was actually my brother fabians and he wasnt terribly careful with his possessions its a bit dented on the back but
554797 its not much but i hope you like it what did you get him
554798 ah yes zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever ave
554799 but you must tell it clearly what you want ozzerwise you might find you ave a leetle less hair zan you would like
554800 im nearly done im just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash ron
554801 i didnt know what would be useful nothing too big because you wouldnt be able to take it with you
554802 so then i thought id like you to have something to remember me by you know if you meet some veela when youre off doing whatever youre doing
554803 i think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground to be honest
554804 you ditched her what are you doing now messing her around
554805 so was i you know why i stopped it and it wasnt because i wanted to
554806 yeah but you go snogging her now and shes just going to get her hopes up again
554807 shes not an idiot she knows it cant happen shes not expecting us to to end up married or
554808 youve really got an eye for that sort of thing
554809 six years ter the day since we met harry dyeh remember it
554810 didnt you smash down the front door give dudley a pigs tail and tell me i was a wizard
554811 here harry couldnt think what ter get teh but then i remembered this
554812 mokeskin hide anythin in there an no one but the owner can get it out theyre rare them
554813 wish dad would hurry up and get here mums getting edgy
554814 especially as i can see that i am gate crashing a party
554815 i shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private
554816 is there such a place he demanded of mr weasley
554817 there will be no need for you to accompany us arthur
554818 i have some questions for the three of you and i think it will be best if we do it individually if you two
554819 you can speak to us together or not at all
554820 i am here as im sure you know because of albus dumbledores will
554821 a surprise apparently you were not aware then that dumbledore had left you anything
554822 dumbledore died over a month ago why has it taken this long to give us what he left us
554823 they wanted to examine whatever hes left us you had no right to do that
554824 the decree for justifiable confiscation gives the ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a will
554825 that law was created to stop wizards passing on dark artifacts
554826 and the ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceaseds possessions are illegal before seizing them are you telling me that you thought dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed
554827 are you planning to follow a career in magical law miss granger
554828 so why have you decided to let us have our things now cant think of a pretext to keep them
554829 they cant keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove theyre dangerous right
554830 if you were not very close to dumbledore how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will he made exceptionally few personal bequests the vast majority of his possessions his private library his magical instruments and other personal effects were left to hogwarts why do you think you were singled out
554831 i when i say we werent close i mean i think he liked me
554832 the last will and testament of albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore yes here we are to ronald bilius weasley i leave my deluminator in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it
554833 it may even be unique certainly it is of dumbledores own design why would he have left you and item so rare
554834 yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three why is that to what use did he think you would put to the deluminator mr weasley
554835 to miss hermione jean granger i leave my copy of the tales of beedle the bard in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive
554836 why do you think dumbledore left you that book miss granger
554837 i dont know he must have thought id enjoy it
554838 did you ever discuss codes or any means of passing secret messages with dumbledore
554839 and if the ministry hasnt found any hidden codes in this book in thirty one days i doubt that i will
554840 i leave the snitch he caught in his first quidditch match at hogwarts as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill
554841 for the reasons you just read out i suppose to remind me what you can get if you persevere and whatever it was
554842 i notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a snitch
554843 oh it cant be a reference to the fact harrys a great seeker thats way too obvious
554844 there must be a secret message from dumbledore hidden in the icing
554845 but a snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object you know why im sure
554846 a snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released not even by the maker who wears gloves it carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it in case of a disputed capture this snitch
554847 will remember your touch potter it occurs to me that dumbledore who had prodigious magical skill whatever his other faults might have enchanted this snitch so that it will open only for you
554848 it chose him he was the one who found it it came to him out of the sorting hat
554849 according to reliable historical sources the sword may present itself to any worthy gryffindor
554850 that does not make it the exclusive property of mr potter whatever dumbledore may have decided
554851 maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall
554852 was it because dumbledore believed that only the sword of godric gryffindor could defeat the heir of slytherin did he wish to give you that sword potter because he believed as do many that you are the one destined to destroy he who must not be named
554853 has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in voldemort maybe the ministry should put some people onto that instead of wasting their time stripping down deluminators or covering up breakouts from azkaban so this is what youve been doing minister shut up in your office trying to break open a snitch people are dying i was nearly one of them voldemort chased me across three countries he killed mad eye moody but theres no word about any of that from the ministry has there and you still expect us to cooperate with you
554854 no dyou want to give him an excuse to arrest us
554855 remembered that i am not dumbledore who forgave your insolence and insubordination you may wear that scar like a crown potter but it is not up to a seventeen year old boy to tell me how to do my job its time you learned some respect
554856 you seem to think that the ministry does not desire what you what dumbledore desired we ought to work together
554857 harry dear everyones awfully hungry we didnt like to start without you shall i serve dinner now
554858 we could have achieved that with peruvian instant darkness powder
554859 i know but surely he wouldnt have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights
554860 dyou think he knew the ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything hed left us
554861 he couldnt tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things but that will doesnt explain
554862 why he couldnt have given us a hint when he was alive
554863 if these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the ministry youd think hed have left us know why unless he thought it was obvious
554864 i always said he was mental brilliant and everything but cracked leaving harry an old snitch what the hell was that about
554865 when scrimgeour made you take it harry i was so sure that something was going to happen
554866 i wasnt going to try too hard in front of scrimgeour was i
554867 the snitch i caught in my first ever quidditch match
554868 i open at the close at the close i open at the close
554869 i was it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year if he wanted me to have it why didnt he just give it to me then
554870 ron you know full well harry and i were brought up by muggles
554871 we didnt hear stories like that when we were little we heard snow white and the seven dwarves and cinderella
554872 i mean just what you hear you know that all these old stories came from beedle i dunno what theyre like in the original versions
554873 but i wonder why dumbledore thought i should read them
554874 probably just charlie now mums asleep sneaking off to regrow his hair
554875 a brutal triple murder by the bridegrooms mother might put a bit of damper on the wedding ill get the light
554876 i wont be bothering with any of this nonsense you can all wear what you like and ill put a full body bird curse on mum until its all over
554877 cried a bit about percy not being here but who wants him oh blimey brace yourselves here they come look
554878 theyll need help understanding our english customs ill look after them
554879 arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair sorry about last night
554880 the ministrys being very anti werewolf at the museum and we thought our presence might not do you any favors
554881 my daughter and i live just over the hill so kind of the good weasleys to invite us but i think you know my luna
554882 she lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes such a glorious infestation how few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes or to give them their correct name the gernumbli gardensi
554883 luna my love if you should feel any burgeoning talent today perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaims in mermish do not repress it you may have been gifted by the gernumblies
554884 but my father has done a lot of research on gernumbli magic
554885 are you sure you dont want to put anything on that bite though
554886 you look smart i told daddy most people would probably wear dress robes but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding for luck you know
554887 and your hairs much too long ronald for a moment i thought you were ginevra merlins beard what is xenophilius lovegood wearing he looks like an omelet and who are you
554888 another weasley you breed like gnomes isnt harry potter here i was hoping to meet him i thought he was a friend of yours ronald or have you merely been boasting
554889 hmm made an excuse did he not as gormless as he looks in press photographs then ive just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara
554890 goblin made you know and been in my family for centuries shes a good looking girl but still well well find me a good seat ronald i am a hundred and seven and i ought not to be on my feet too long
554891 she used to come for christmas every year then thank god she took offense because fred and george set off a dungbomb under her chair at diner dad always says shell have written them out of her will like they care theyre going to end up richer than anyone in the family rate theyre going wow
554892 your great aunt muriel doesnt agree i just met her upstairs while she was giving fleur the tiara
554893 yeah shes just told me my ears are lopsided old bat i wish old uncle bilius was still with us though he was a right laugh at weddings
554894 wasnt he the one who saw a grim and died twenty four hours later
554895 well yeah he went a bit odd toward the end
554896 but before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party
554897 he used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky then run onto the dance floor hoist up his robes and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his
554898 i didnt know you were goodness its lovely to see how are you
554899 or were going to get run over by the bride
554900 we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls
554901 but i must say ginevras dress is far too low cut
554902 daddys just gone to give bill and fleur our present
554903 thats xenophilius lovegood hes the father of a friend of ours
554904 if he vus not a guest of fleurs i vould dud him here and now for veering that filthy sign upon his chest
554905 grindelvald killed many people my grandfather for instance of course he vos never powerful in this country they said he feared dumbledore and rightly seeing how he vos finished but this
554906 this is his symbol i recognized it at vunce grindelvald carved it into a vall at durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to shock make themselves impressive until those of us who had lost family members to grindelvald taught them better
554907 i walked past that sign for several years i know it vell
554908 that xenophilius doesnt actually know what the symbol means the lovegoods are quite unusual he could have easily picked it up somewhere and think its a cross section of the head of a crumple horned snorkack or something
554909 well i dont know what they are but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them
554910 i had not realized i ever discussed my vand with fans
554911 he retired several years ago i was one of the last to purchase a gregorovitch vand they are the best although i know of course that your britons set much store by ollivander
554912 and shes seeing someone jealous type big bloke you wouldnt want to cross him
554913 is the point of being an international quidditch player if all the good looking girls are taken
554914 my dear boy arthur told me you were here disguised i am so glad so honored
554915 after dumbledore the shock and for you i am sure
554916 elphias i dont know whether you saw the interview rita skeeter gave about dumbledore
554917 oh yes harry i saw it that woman or vulture might be a more accurate term positively pestered me to talk to her i am ashamed to say that i became rather rude called her an interfering trout which resulted as you my have seen in aspersions cast upon my sanity
554918 rita skeeter hinted that professor dumbledore was involved in the dark arts when he was young
554919 not a word harry let nothing tarnish your memories of albus dumbledore
554920 you there give me your chair im a hundred and seven
554921 now what were you saying about rita skeeter elphias you know shes written a biography of dumbledore i cant wait to read it i must remember to place an order at flourish and blotts
554922 theres no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh there were some mighty funny rumors about albus
554923 i noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours
554924 oh we all know you worshipped dumbledore i daresay youll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his squib sister
554925 who said his sister was a squib i thought she was ill
554926 anyway how could you expect to know anything about it it all happened years and years before you were even thought of my dear and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened thats why i cant wait to find out what skeeters unearthed dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time
554927 why did half of us never even know she existed until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her where was saintly albus while ariana was locked in the cellar off being brilliant at hogwarts and never mind what was going on in his own house
554928 she never pretended anything of the sort kendra was a fine woman
554929 proud and very domineering the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a squib
554930 so you say elphias but explain then why she never attended hogwarts
554931 in our day squibs were often hushed up thought to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didnt exist
554932 and yet she was never taken to st mungos and no healer was ever summoned to see her
554933 for your information elphias my cousin lancelot was a healer at st mungos at the time and he told my family in strictest confidence that ariana had never been seen there all most suspicious lancelot thought
554934 id have said that it was she who finished off ariana
554935 a mother kill her own daughter think what youre saying
554936 if the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end why not
554937 but as i say it doesnt fit because kendra died before ariana of what nobody ever seemed sure
554938 yes ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed kendra in the struggle
554939 shake your head all you like elphias you were at arianas funeral were you not
554940 his heart wasnt the only thing didnt aberforth break albus nose halfway through the service
554941 bathilda described the whole thing to mother while i was listening at the door
554942 i think bathilda has spilled the beans to rita skeeter all those hints in skeeters interview about an important source close to the dumbledores goodness knows she was there all through the ariana business and it would fit
554943 a most gifted magical historian and an old friend of albuss
554944 if that is so it is even more dishonorable for skeeter to have taken advantage of her
554945 and no reliance can be placed on anything bathilda may have said
554946 oh there are ways of bringing back memories and im sure rita skeeter knows them all
554947 but even if bathildas completely cuckoo im sure shed still have old photographs maybe even letters she knew the dumbledores for years well worth a trip to godrics hollow id have thought
554948 oh yes shes been there forever the dumbledores moved there after percival was imprisoned and she was their neighbor
554949 the ministry has fallen scrimgeour is dead they are coming
554950 walk just walk we need to find somewhere for you to change
554951 why didnt i make sure i had the invisibility cloak with me
554952 its okay ive got the cloak ive got clothes for both of you
554953 tricky but i think ive done it okay anyway i managed to fit everything we need in here
554954 and i had them all stacked by subject oh well harry youd better take the invisibility cloak ron hurry up and change
554955 i told you at the burrow ive had the essentials packed for days you know in case we needed to make a quick getaway i packed your rucksack this morning harry after you changed and put it in here i just had a feeling
554956 its you theyre after harry and well just put everyone in even more danger by going back
554957 most of the order was there theyll look after everyone
554958 just as a matter of interest why tottenham court road
554959 ive no idea it just popped into my head but im sure were safer out in the muggle world its not where theyll expect us to be
554960 we can hardly book rooms at the leaky cauldron can we and grimmauld place is out if snape can get in there i suppose we could try my parents home though i think theres a chance they might check there oh i wish theyd shut up
554961 fancy a drink ditch ginger and come and have a pint
554962 you know were not far from the leaky cauldron here its only in charing cross
554963 not to stay there but to find out whats going on
554964 we know whats going on voldemorts taken over the ministry what else do we need to know
554965 i say we find a quiet place to disapparate and head for the countryside once were there we could send a message to the order
554966 well as long as it doesnt get them into trouble though they mightve been arrested already god thats revolting
554967 lets get going then i dont want to drink this muck
554968 hermione have you got muggle money to pay for this
554969 yes i took out all my building society savings before i came to the burrow ill bet all the change is at the bottom
554970 bellowed the death eater and the table behind which harry was standing blew up the force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the cloak slipped off him
554971 screamed hermione from out of sight and the death eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china table and coffee
554972 she said pointing her wand at ron who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans leaving a deep cut
554973 oh im so sorry ron my hands shaking the severed ropes fell away ron got to his feet shaking his arms to regain feeling in them harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond death eater was sprawled across the bench
554974 i shouldve recognized him he was there the night dumbledore died
554975 i recognize him from the old wanted posters i think the big ones thorfinn rowle
554976 how did they find us what are we going to do
554977 kill them theyd kill us they had a good go just now
554978 its better like that itll throw them off the scent if we killed them itd be obvious we were here
554979 take care of the other one and the waitress while ron and i clear up
554980 dont you think they might wonder whats happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like its just been bombed
554981 its no wonder i cant get it out hermione you packed my old jeans theyre tight
554982 you you dont think youve still got your trace on you do you harry
554983 the trace breaks at seventeen thats wizarding law you cant put it on an adult
554984 what if the death eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen year old
554985 but harry hasnt been near a death eater in the last twenty four hours whos supposed to have put a trace back on him
554986 if i cant use magic and you cant use magic near me without us giving away our position
554987 rons dad said theyve put up jinxes against him and even if they havent worked
554988 so what i swear id like nothing better than to meet snape
554989 hermione where else is there its the best chance weve got snapes only one death eater if ive still got the trace on me well have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go
554990 so where are these jinxes they put up against snape
554991 that m must have b been the t tongue tying curse mad eye set up for snape
554992 but it wasnt really him was it just something to scare snape
554993 before we go any farther i think wed better check
554994 that was a spell to reveal human presence and theres nobody here except us
554995 and youd think if harry still had a trace on him theyd have followed us here i know they cant get in the house but whats up harry
554996 what else didnt you see anything was he cursing someone
554997 your scar again but whats going on i thought that connection had closed
554998 i i think its started opening again whenever he loses control thats how it used to
554999 harry dumbledore didnt want you to use that connection he wanted you to shut it down thats why you were supposed to use occlumency
555000 its your family course you were worried id feel the same way
555001 i dont want to be on my own could we use the sleeping bags ive brought and camp in here tonight
555002 more rowle or shall we end it and feed you to nagini lord voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time you called me back for this to tell me that harry potter has escaped again draco give rowle another taste of our displeasure do it or feel my wrath yourself
555003 harry do you want your toothbrush ive got it here
555004 harry dont just disappear please we were terrified why did you come up here anyway
555005 did you make all this mess or was some of it done when you got here
555006 i thought so every room i looked into on the way up had been disturbed what were they after do you think
555007 but youd think hed already have all he needed i mean was
555008 what about information on dumbledore the second page of the letter for instance you know this bathilda my mum mentions you know who she is
555009 so your parents knew her she was an incredible magic historian
555010 and she lives in godrics hollow rons auntie muriel was talking about her at the wedding she knew dumbledores family too be pretty interesting to talk to wouldnt she
555011 i understand why youd love to talk to her about your mum and dad and dumbledore too
555012 but that wouldnt really help us in our search for the horcruxes would it
555013 harry i know you really want to go to godrics hollow but im scared im scared at how easily those death eaters found us yesterday it just makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried im sure theyd be expecting you to visit it
555014 of course i can see why thats upset you harry
555015 id just like to know whether or not its true or
555016 harry do you really think youll get the truth from a malicious old woman like muriel or from rita skeeter how can you believe them you knew dumbledore
555017 but you know how much truth there was in everything rita wrote about you doge is right how can you let these people tarnish your memories of dumbledore
555018 sirius told me about him he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave so they killed him
555019 if he was a death eater he had access to voldemort and if he became disenchanted then he would have wanted to bring voldemort down
555020 what that was siriuss brother wasnt it regulus arcturus regulus
555021 regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the death eaters
555022 hes sitting in the middle of the front row thats where the seeker never mind
555023 oh it could still be here but under counter enchantments
555024 charms to prevent it from being summoned magically you know
555025 like voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave
555026 whether hed manage to destroy it or not hed want to keep it hidden from voldemort wouldnt he
555027 he had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen cmon
555028 she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement kitchen and slammed the door behind them
555029 back in my mistresss old house with the blood traitor weasley and the mudblood
555030 i forbid you to call anyone blood traitor or mudblood
555031 there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs we threw it out did you steal it back
555032 mundungus fletcher stole it all miss bellas and miss cissys pictures my mistresss gloves the order of merlin first class the goblets with the family crest and and
555033 i dont think so right kreacher i want the truth how do you know mundungus fletcher stole the locket
555034 kreacher saw him coming out of kreachers cupboard with his hands full of kreachers treasures
555035 why where did it come from what did regulus have to do with it kreacher sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket and everything regulus had to do with it
555036 master sirius ran away good riddance for he was a bad boy and broke my mistresss heart with his lawless ways
555037 and master regulus had volunteered kreacher it was an honor said master regulus an honor for him and for kreacher who must be sure to do whatever the dark lord ordered him to do and then to c come home
555038 there was a b basin full of potion on the island
555039 kreacher drank and as he drank he saw terrible thing kreachers insides burned kreacher cried for master regulus to save him he cried for his mistress black but the dark lord only laughed he made kreacher drink all the potion he dropped a locket into the empty basin he filled it with more potion
555040 and then the dark lord sailed away leaving kreacher on the island
555041 kreacher needed water he crawled to the islands edge and he drank from the black lake and hands dead hands came out of the water and dragged kreacher under the surface
555042 but you couldnt apparate in and out of that cave
555043 i mean they can apparate and disapparate in and out of hogwarts when we cant
555044 of course voldemort would have considered the ways of house elves far beneath his notice it would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didnt
555045 kreacher was told to come home so kreacher came home
555046 well then you did what you were told didnt you
555047 what did regulus say when you told him what happened
555048 master regulus told kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house
555049 m master regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the dark lord had
555050 and he told kreacher to take it and when the basin was empty to switch the lockets
555051 the mudblood touched kreacher he will not allow it what would his mistress say
555052 oh dont you see now how sick it is the way theyve got to obey
555053 kreacher tried everything everything he knew but nothing nothing would work so many powerful spells upon the casing kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it but it would not open kreacher punished himself he tried again he punished himself he tried again
555054 voldemort tried to kill you regulus died to bring voldemort down but you were still happy to betray sirius to voldemort
555055 hes a slave house elves are used to bad even brutal treatment what voldemort did to kreacher wasnt that far out of the common way what do wizard wars mean to an elf like kreacher hes loyal to people who are kind to him and mrs black must have been and regulus certainly was so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs i know what youre going to say
555056 that regulus changed his mind but he doesnt seem to have explained that to kreacher does he
555057 sirius was horrible to kreacher harry and its no good looking like that you know its true kreacher had been alone for such a long time when sirius came to live here and he was probably starving for a bit of affection im sure miss cissy and miss bella were perfectly lovely to kreacher when he turned up so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know ive said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house elves well voldemort did and so did sirius
555058 when you feel up to it er please sit up
555059 kreacher i am going to ask you to do something
555060 kreacher i want you please to go and find mundungus fletcher we need to find out where the locket where master reguluss locket it its really important we want to finish the work master regulus started we want to er ensure that he didnt die in vain
555061 this belonged to regulus and im sure hed want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you
555062 or theyd have sent snape in after us wouldnt they
555063 dyou reckon hes been in here and has his tongue tied by moodys curse
555064 otherwise hed have been able to tell that lot how to get in wouldnt he but theyre probably watching to see whether we turn up they know that harry owns the house after all
555065 wizarding wills are examined by the ministry remember theyll know sirius left you the place
555066 and he left me the deluminator maybe im supposed to use it
555067 then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him raising its dead hand
555068 i am remus john lupin werewolf sometimes known as moony one of the four creators of the marauders map married to nymphadora usually known as tonks and i taught you how to produce a patronus harry which takes the form of a stag
555069 speaking as your ex defense against the dark arts teacher i quite agree that you had to check ron hermione you shouldnt be so quick to lower your defenses
555070 i had to apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me they cant know youre in here or im sure theyd have more people out there theyre staking out everywhere thats got any connection with you harry lets go downstairs theres a lot to tell you and i want to know what happened after you left the burrow
555071 id have been here three days ago but i needed to shake off the death eater tailing me
555072 only after we ran into a couple of death eaters in a caf on tottenham court road
555073 but how did they find you so quickly its impossible to track anyone who apparates unless you grab hold of them as they disappear
555074 and it doesnt seem likely they were just strolling down tottenham court road at the time does it
555075 apart from anything else theyd know for sure harry was here if he still had the trace on him wouldnt they but i cant see how they could have tracked you to tottenham court road thats worrying really worrying
555076 tell us what happened after we left we havent heard a thing since rons dad told us the family was safe
555077 thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to disapparate before they arrived
555078 a mixture but to all intents and purposes theyre the same thing now
555079 there were about a dozen of them but they didnt know you were there harry arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of scrimgeour before they killed him if its true he didnt give you away
555080 the death eaters searched the burrow from top to bottom
555081 they found the ghoul but didnt want to get too close and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours they were trying to get information on you harry but of course nobody apart from the order knew that you had been there
555082 at the same time that they were smashing up the wedding more death eaters were forcing their way into every order connected house in the country no deaths
555083 but they were rough they burned down dedalus diggles house but as you know he wasnt there and they used the cruciarus curse on tonkss family again trying to find out where you went after you visited them theyre all right shaken obviously but otherwise okay
555084 what youve got to realize harry is that the death eaters have got the full might of the ministry on their side now
555085 theyve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest they managed to penetrate every defensive spell wed cast against them and once inside they were completely open about why theyd come
555086 and are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing harrys whereabouts out of people
555087 youll know sooner or later anyway thats their pretext for going after you
555088 the official version of scrimgeours murder is that he resigned he has been replaced by pius thicknesse who is under the imperius curse
555089 naturally many people have deduced what has happened there has been such a dramatic change in ministry policy in the last few days and many are whispering that voldemort must be behind it however that is the point they whisper they darent confide in each other not knowing whom to trust they are scared to speak out in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted yes voldemort is playing a very clever game declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion remaining masked has created confusion uncertainty and fear
555090 involves warning the wizarding world against me instead of voldemort
555091 its mental if you could steal magic there wouldnt be any squibs would there
555092 nevertheless unless you can prove that you have at least one close wizarding relative you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment
555093 what if purebloods and halfbloods swear a part of their family
555094 ill teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it
555095 ron as were on the run with harry potter the most wanted person in the country i dont think it matters if i was going back to school it would be different whats voldemort planning for hogwarts
555096 attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard
555097 that was announced yesterday its a change because it was never obligatory before of course nearly every witch and wizard in britain has been educated at hogwarts but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred this way voldemort will have the whole wizarding population under his eye from a young age and its also another way of weeding out muggle borns because students must be given blood status meaning that they have proven to the ministry that they are of wizard descent before they are allowed to attend
555098 and ron and hermione are in on it and theyre coming with me
555099 i cant remus im sorry if dumbledore didnt tell you i dont think i can
555100 but i might still be of some use to you you know what i am and what i can do i could come with you to provide protection there would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to
555101 youre married how does she feel about you going away with us
555102 so do you accept my offer will three become four i cannot believe that dumbledore would have disapproved he appointed me your defense against the dark arts teacher after all and i must tell you that i believe we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined
555103 you want to leave tonks at her parents house and come away with us
555104 harry im sure james would have wanted me to stick with you
555105 im not im pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you arent sticking with your own kid actually
555106 i i made a grave mistake in marrying tonks i did it against my better judgment and have regretted it very much every since
555107 so youre just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us
555108 dont you understand what ive done to my wife and my unborn child i should never have married her ive made her an outcast
555109 you have only ever seen me amongst the order or under dumbledores protection at hogwarts you dont know how most of the wizarding world sees creatures like me when they know of my affliction they can barely talk to me dont you see what ive done
555110 my kind dont usually breed it will be like me i am convinced of it how can i forgive myself when i knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child and if by some miracle it is not like me then it will be better off a hundred times so without a father of whom it must always be ashamed
555111 dont say that how could any child be ashamed of you
555112 what will they do to a half werewolf whose fathers in the order my father died trying to protect my mother and me and you reckon hed tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us
555113 this is not about a desire for for danger or personal glory how dare you suggest such a
555114 the man who taught me to fight dementors a coward
555115 but if it makes him go back to tonks itll be worth it wont it
555116 slammed the door in my face when i went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade cauldron cakes
555117 the first year they were there i only ever saw the two boys wouldnt have known there was a daughter if i hadnt been picking plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in and saw kendra leading ariana out into the back garden walked her round the lawn once keeping a firm grip on her then took her back inside didnt know what to make of it
555118 youre not in much of a position to make threats
555119 kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief master
555120 fletcher knows how to avoid capture has many hidey holes and accomplices nevertheless kreacher cornered the thief in the end
555121 for your information none of the rest of us disapparated
555122 well youre a bunch of bleedin eroes then arent you but i never pretended i was up for killing meself
555123 were not interested in why you ran out on mad eye
555124 we already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum
555125 well then why the ell am i being unted down by ouse elves
555126 its not about the goblets either although youre getting warmer
555127 call im off call im off e should be locked up
555128 we need him conscious kreacher but if he needs persuading you can do the honors
555129 when you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find
555130 you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard there was a locket there
555131 hes wondering whether he should have asked more money for it
555132 that wouldnt have been effing difficult bleedin gave it away din i no choice
555133 i was selling in diagon alley and she come up to me and asks if ive got a license for trading in magical artifacts bleedin snoop she was gonna fine me but she took a fancy to the locket an told me shed take it and let me off that time and to fink meself lucky
555134 screamed hermione and a jet of water streamed from her wand engulfing a spluttering and choking mundungus harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in rons and hermiones faces the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again
555135 greeted him the chill wind swept him and his tongue rolled up for a moment
555136 shoes off if you please master harry and hands washed before dinner
555137 i welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest wizarding traditions and values like committing murder and cutting off peoples ears i suppose snape headmaster snape in dumbledores study merlins pants
555138 the other teachers wont stand for this mcgonagall and flitwick and sprout all know the truth they know how dumbledore died they wont accept snape as headmaster and who are these carrows
555139 there are pictures of them inside they were at the top of the tower when snape killed dumbledore so its all friends together and
555140 i cant see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay if the ministry and voldemort are behind snape itll be a choice between staying and teaching or a nice few years in azkaban and thats if theyre lucky i reckon theyll stay to try and protect the students
555141 well at least we know exactly where snape is now
555142 there are still a load of death eaters watching this house
555143 more than usual its like theyre hoping well march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the hogwarts express
555144 ive been thinking about that all day it left nearly six hours ago weird not being on it isnt it
555145 i landed badly on the top step and the cloak slipped
555146 and what in the name of merlins most baggy y fronts was that about
555147 snape could send phineas nigellus to look inside this house for him
555148 but let him try it now all phineas nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag
555149 watched the ministry entrance for seven hours no sign of her saw your dad though ron he looks fine
555150 dad always told us most ministry people use the floo network to get to work
555151 thats why we havent seen umbridge shed never walk shed think shes too important
555152 and what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes
555153 dad said everyone from magical maintenance wears navy blue robes
555154 you do realize dont you that theres probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the ministry of
555155 i dont think were going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the ministry entrance for another month the longer we put it off the farther away that locket could be theres already a good chance umbridge has chucked it away the thing doesnt open
555156 shes found a way of opening it and shes now possessed
555157 wouldnt make any difference to her she was so evil in the first place
555158 we know theyve stopped apparition in and out of the ministry we know only the most senior ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the floo network now because ron heard those two unspeakables complaining about it
555159 and we know you get in using those funny coins or tokens or whatever they are because i saw that witch borrowing one from her friend
555160 i dont know harry i dont know there are an awful lot of things that could go wrong so much relies on chance
555161 lets say we go for it tomorrow i think it should just be me and harry
555162 its one thing hanging around the entrances under the cloak but this is different hermione
555163 youre on the list of muggle borns who didnt present themselves for interrogation
555164 and youre supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the burrow
555165 let me know if you ever defeat voldemort wont you
555166 well if all three of us go well have to disapparate separately
555167 master has not finished his soup would master prefer the savory stew or else the treacle tart to which master is so partial
555168 thanks kreacher but ill be back in a minute er bathroom
555169 he no live here he no live here i know him not
555170 we know your scar hurt downstairs and youre white as a sheet
555171 fine ive just seen voldemort murdering a woman by now hes probably killed her whole family and he didnt need to it was cedric all over again they were just
555172 dumbledore wanted you to use occlumency he thought the connection was dangerous voldemort can it harry what good is it to watch him kill and torture how can it help
555173 hermione i cant you know im lousy at occlumency i never got the hang of it
555174 i hate it i hate the fact that he can get inside me that i have to watch him when hes most dangerous but im going to use it
555175 forget dumbledore this is my choice nobody elses i want to know why hes after gregorovitch
555176 voldemorts got ollivander locked up somewhere if hes already got a wandmaker what does he need another one for
555177 maybe he agrees with krum maybe he thinks gregorovitch is better or else he thinks gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me because ollivander didnt know
555178 but made it happen why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power
555179 because i know it wasnt me and so does voldemort hermione we both know what really happened
555180 its up to him and if were going to the ministry tomorrow dont you reckon we should go over the plan
555181 polyjuice potion invisibiliity cloak decoy detonators you should each take a couple just in case puking pastilles nosebleed norgat extendable ears
555182 and when you think i used to fantasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall
555183 and i thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here
555184 youd better take this hermione and here are the tokens
555185 were running late mr magical maintenance will be here any second
555186 you cant go to work in this state i think you ought to go to st mungos and get them to sort you out
555187 it would have made much less mess to stun him too
555188 but i still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention keen on his job though isnt he chuck us the hair and the potion then
555189 weird he wasnt wearing them today wasnt it seeing how much he wanted to go anyway im reg cattermole according to the label in the back
555190 blooming pain in the bum this eh forcing us all to get to work this way who are they expecting to turn up harry potter
555191 i requested somebody from magical maintenance to sort out my office cattermole its still raining in there
555192 raining in your office thats thats not good is it
555193 you realize that i am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife cattermole in fact im quite surprised youre not down there holding her hand while she waits already given her up as a bad job have you probably wise be sure and marry a pureblood next time
555194 not that any woman i married would ever be mistaken for such filth and the head of department of magical law enforcement needed a job doing i would make it my priority to do this job cattermole do you understand me
555195 then attend to it cattermole and if my office is not completely dry within an hour your wifes blood status will be in even greater doubt than it is now
555196 if i dont turn up my wife i mean cattermoles wife
555197 thats mental we havent got much time you two find umbridge ill go and sort out yaxleys office but how do i stop a raining
555198 that should stop the rain if its a hex or curse if it doesnt somethings gone wrong with an atmospheric charm which will be more difficult to fix so as an interim measure try impervius to protect his belongings
555199 level four department for the regulation and control of magical creatures incorporating beast being and spirit divisions goblin liaison office and pest advisory bureau
555200 dirk cresswell eh from goblin liaison nice one albert im pretty confident ill get his job now
555201 level two department of magical law enforcement including the improper use of magic office auror headquarters and wizengamot administration services
555202 actually harry i think id better go after him i dont think he knows what hes doing and if he gets caught the whole thing
555203 thats that problem solved minister if mafalda can be spared for record keeping we shall be able to start straightaway
555204 ten people today and one of them the wife of a ministry employee tut tut even here in the heart of the ministry
555205 well go straight down mafalda youll find everything you need in the courtroom good morning albert arent you getting out
555206 arthur weasley someone said he was up on level one
555207 if you ask me the blood traitors are as bad as the mudbloods good day runcorn
555208 will the old hag be interrogating mudbloods all day does anyone know
555209 what has she got magic ears as well as an eye now
555210 i bet it sneaked up here from experimental charms theyre so careless remember that poisonous duck
555211 harry blimey i forgot what you looked like why isnt hermione with you
555212 she had to go down to the courtrooms with umbridge she couldnt refuse and
555213 i quite understand what youre saying wakanda but im afraid i cannot be party to
555214 isnt your wife in for questioning today er whats happened to you why are you so wet
555215 i couldnt stop it so theyve sent me to get bernie pillsworth i think they said
555216 you tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree didnt you
555217 so dirk cresswell is ten times the wizard you are
555218 and if he survives azkaban youll have to answer to him not to mention his wife his sons and his friends
555219 no no im half blood im half blood i tell you my father was a wizard he
555220 if you struggle you will be subjected to the dementors kiss
555221 a wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the ministry today mrs cattermole
555222 eight and three quarter inches cherry unicorn hair core do you recognize the description
555223 could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand
555224 i dont know where he is he was supposed to meet me here
555225 theyre frightened they think that i might not come home
555226 i didnt t take it from anybody i b bought it when i was eleven years old it it it
555227 no i dont think so mrs cattermole wands only choose witches or wizards you are not a witch i have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here mafalda pass them to me
555228 the s stands for selwyn i am related to the selwyns indeed there are few pure blood families to whom i am not related a pity
555229 hermione if you think i was going to sit here and let her pretend
555230 but but reg said you were the one who submitted my name for questioning
555231 i know that harry but if she wakes up and the lockets gone i need to duplicate it
555232 go home grab your children and get out get out of the country if youve got to disguise yourselves and run youve seen how it is you wont get anything like a fair hearing here
555233 how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door
555234 its been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families
555235 go abroad if you can just get well away from the ministry thats the er new official position now if youll just follow the patronuses youll be able to leave the atrium
555236 runcorn let me out he attacked umbridge and yaxley and hes told all of us to leave the country i think wed better do it reg i really do lets hurry home and fetch the children and why are you so wet
555237 harry they know there are intruders inside the ministry something about a hole in umbridges office door
555238 okay all of you who havent got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has well need to be fast before they stop us come on
555239 this lot need to leave before you seal the exits
555240 weve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone
555241 would you like me to have your family tree examined like i had dirk cresswells
555242 i didnt mean nothing albert but i thought i thought they were in for questioning and
555243 purer than many of yours i daresay off you go
555244 my wife who was that with my wife whats going on
555245 let go im not your husband youve got to go home
555246 harry quickly in my bag theres a small bottle labeled essence of dittany
555247 there are spells that would put him completely right but i darent try in case i do them wrong and cause more damage hes lost so much blood already
555248 why are we here i thought we were going back to grimmauld place
555249 harry i dont think were going to be able to go back there
555250 as we disapparated yaxley caught hold of me and i couldnt get rid of him he was too strong and he was still holding on when we arrived at grimmauld place and then well i think he must have seen the door and thought we were stopping there so he slackened his grip and i managed to sake him off and i brought us here instead
555251 but then wheres he hang on you dont mean hes at grimmauld place he cant get in there
555252 harry i think he can i i forced him to let go with a revulsion jinx but id already taken him inside the fidelius charms protection since dumbledore died were secret keepers so ive given him the secret havent i
555253 dont be stupid it wasnt your fault if anything it was mine
555254 umbridge had stuck it to her office door to spy on people i couldnt leave it there but thats how they knew there were intruders
555255 in the woods where they held the quidditch world cup
555256 if were staying we should put some protective enchantments around the place
555257 i thought this belonged to that bloke perkins at the ministry
555258 apparently he didnt want it back his lumbagos so bad
555259 she added pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas which in one fluid motion rose into the air and settled fully constructed onto the ground before harry out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope
555260 but it feels like a a jinx or something cant we call him you know who please
555261 in case you hadnt noticed mate calling you know who by his name didnt do dumbledore much good in the end
555262 just just show you know who some respect will you
555263 harry repeated but hermione shot him a warning look apparently he was not to argue with ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition
555264 as long as mr cattermole had his wits about him hell have transported mrs cattermole by side along apparition and theyll be fleeing the country right now with their children thats what harry told her to do
555265 i didnt get the feeling reg cattermole was all that quick witted though the way everyone was talking to me when i was him god i hope they made it if they both end up in azkaban because of us
555266 what did we just go through all that for the locket wheres the locket
555267 shouted ron raising himself a little higher on his pillows
555268 no one tells me anything blimey you could have mentioned it
555269 well we were running for our lives from the death eaters werent we
555270 there isnt any chance someones destroyed it since kreacher had it
555271 thered be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed
555272 were going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it
555273 keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it
555274 i think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent
555275 and well need to think about some food as well you stay there
555276 i have it not i have it no more it was many years ago stolen from me
555277 do not lie to lord voldemort gregorovitch he knows he always knows
555278 hes found gregorovitch hermione and i think hes killed him but before he killed him he read gregorovitchs mind and i saw
555279 i think id better take over the watch if youre so tired youre falling sleep
555280 he found gregorovitch he had him tied up he was torturing him
555281 hows gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if hes tied up
555282 he asked him to hand it over but gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him and then then
555283 he read gregorovitchs mind and i saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill and he fired a curse at gregorovitch and jumped out of sight he stole it he stole whatever after and i i think ive seen him somewhere
555284 harry you dont reckon after something else to turn into a horcrux
555285 maybe but wouldnt it be dangerous for him to make another one didnt hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already
555286 harry what happened why do you think you couldnt make your patronus you managed perfectly yesterday
555287 im starving all ive had since i bled half to death is a couple of toadstools
555288 you go and fight your way through the dementors then
555289 i would but my arms in a sling in case you hadnt noticed
555290 i remember everything weve done while ive bee wearing it i wouldnt know what id done if id been possessed would i ginny told me there were times when she couldnt remember anything
555291 well maybe we ought not to wear it we can just keep it in the tent
555292 but well take turns wearing it so nobody keeps it on too long
555293 and now weve sorted that out can we please get some food
555294 theres no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around
555295 not if i left some money under the chicken coo
555296 yeah lets go to albania shouldnt take more than an afternoon to search an entire country
555297 there cant be anything there hed already made five of his horcruxes before he went into exile and dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth
555298 we know the snakes not in albania its usually with vol
555299 fine the snake is usually with you know who happy
555300 i cant see him hiding anything at borgin and burkes
555301 borgin and burke were experts at dark objects they wouldve recognized a horcrux straightaway
555302 i still reckon he might have hidden something at hogwarts
555303 dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of hogwarts secrets
555304 if there was one place that was really important to you know who it was hogwarts
555305 this is you know who were talking about right not you
555306 you told us that you know who asked dumbledore to give him a job after he left
555307 and dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something probably another founders object to make into another horcrux
555308 so he never got the chance to find a founders object there and hide it in the school
555309 harry caught the fish and i did my best with it i notice im always the one who ends up sorting out the food because im a girl i suppose
555310 no its because youre supposed to be the best at magic
555311 you can do the cooking tomorrow ron you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating and ill sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see you
555312 how can you side with him he hardly ever does the cook
555313 muffliato muggle repelling and disillusionment charms all of it they shouldnt be able to hear of see us whoever they are
555314 there ought to be a few salmon in here or dyou reckon its too early in the season accio salmon
555315 so you three have been on the run how long
555316 met up with griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with gornuk not long after nice to have a but of company
555317 heard death eaters were in the area last week and decided id better run for it refused to register as a muggle born on principle see so i knew it was a matter of time knew id have to leave in the end my wife should be okay shes pure blood and then i net dean here what a few days ago son
555318 my dad left my mum when i was a kid ive got no proof he was a wizard though
555319 ive got to say dirk im surprised to run into you pleased but surprised word was that youd been caught
555320 i was halfway to azkaban when i made a break for it stunned dawlish and nicked his broom it was easier than youd think i dont reckon hes quite right at the moment might be confunded if so id like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it probably saved my life
555321 and where do you two fit in i er had the impression the goblins were for you know who on the whole
555322 having refused what i considered an impertinent request i could see that my person safety was in jeopardy
555323 gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race i recognize no wizarding master
555324 didnt manage to lock a death eater up in one of the old high security vaults i suppose
555325 if i had the sword would not have helped him break out
555326 so is severus snape though he does not know it
555327 about the kids who tried to steal gryffindors sword out of snapes office at hogwarts
555328 griphook here told me he heard about it from bill weasley who works for the bank one of the kids who tried to take the sword was bills younger sister
555329 she and a couple of friends got into snapes office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase
555330 what did they think that theyd be able to use the sword on you know who or on snape himself
555331 well whatever they thought they were going to do with it snape decided the sword wasnt safe where it was
555332 couple of days later once hed got the say so from you know who i imagine he sent it down to london to be kept in gringotts instead
555333 oh yes it is a copy en excellent copy it is true but it was wizard made the original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin made armor possesses wherever the genuine sword of gryffindor is it is not in a vault at gringotts bank
555334 and i take it you didnt bother telling the death eaters this
555335 i saw no reason to trouble them with the information
555336 what happened to ginny and all the others the ones who tried to steal it
555337 i mean the weasleys dont need any more of their kids injured do they
555338 they suffered no serious injury as far as i am aware
555339 with snapes track record i suppose we should just be glad theyre still alive
555340 youre not going to sit there and tell me you think potter had anything to do with it
555341 and i reckon hes the real thing the chosen one or whatever you want to call it
555342 yeah theres a lot would like to believe hes that son
555343 you deserve to be lied to if youre still reading that much dirk you want the facts try the quibbler
555344 you want to give it a look xeno is printing all the stuff the prophets ignoring not a single mention of crumple horned snorkacks in the last issue how long theyll let him get with it mind i dont know but xeno says front page of every issue that any wizard whos against you know who ought to make helping harry potter their number one priority
555345 hard to help a boy whos vanished off the face of the earth
555346 listen the fact that they havent caught him yets one hell of an achievement
555347 id take tips from him gladly its what were trying to do stay free isnt it
555348 with the whole of the ministry and all their informers looking for him id have expected him to be caught by now mind whos to say they havent already caught and killed him without publicizing it
555349 if somebody swapped the real sword for the face while it was in dumbledores office
555350 phineas nigellus would have seen it happen he hangs right beside the case
555351 remove this foul addition at once remove it i say you are ruining a great work of art where am i what is going on
555352 can that possible be the voice of the elusive mr potter
555353 weve got a couple of questions to ask you about the sword of gryffindor
555354 your tone displeases me the girl and her friends were foolhardily in the extreme thieving from the headmaster
555355 exactly what claim did the weasley girl have upon it she deserved her punishment as did the idiot longbottom and the lovegood oddity
555356 neville is not an idiot and luna is not an oddity
555357 where have you brought me why have you removed me from the house of my forebears
555358 never mind that how did snape punish ginny neville and luna
555359 professor snape sent them into the forbidden forest to do some work for the oaf hagrid
555360 buy ginny neville and luna probably had a good laugh with hagrid the forbidden forest theyve faced plenty worse than the forbidden forest big deal
555361 what we really wanted to know professor black is whether anyone else has um taken out the sword at all maybe its been taken away for cleaning or something
555362 goblin made armor does not require cleaning simple girl goblins silver repels mundane dirt imbibing only that which strengthens it
555363 perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmasters office
555364 evidently it is not only muggle borns who are ignorant potter the portraits of hogwarts may commune with each other but they cannot travel outside of the castle except to visit a painting of themselves elsewhere dumbledore cannot come here with me and after the treatment i have received at your hands i can assure you that i will not be making a return visit
555365 couldnt you just tell us please when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case before ginny took it out i mean
555366 i believe that the last time i saw the sword of gryffindor leave its case was when professor dumbledore used it to break open a ring
555367 professor snape has more important things on his mind that the many eccentricities of albus dumbledore good bye potter
555368 the sword can destroy horcruxes goblin made blades imbibe only that which strengthens them harry that swords impregnated with basilisk venom
555369 and dumbledore didnt five it to me because he still needed it he wanted to use it on the locket
555370 and he must have realized they wouldnt let you have it if he put it in his will
555371 but snape knows how to get in wouldnt that be a bit risky
555372 not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords
555373 so would he have hidden the sword well away from hogsmeade then what dyou reckon ron ron
555374 you two carry on dont let me spoil your fun
555375 all right ill spit it out dont expect me to skip up and down the tent because theres some other damn thing weve got to find just add it to the list of stuff you dont know
555376 its not like im not having the time of my life here
555377 you know with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night i just hoped you know after wed been running round a few weeks wed have achieved something
555378 so what part of it isnt living up to your expectations
555379 did you think wed be staying in five star hotels finding a horcrux every other day did you think youd be back to mummy by christmas
555380 we thought dumbledore had told you what to do we thought you had a real plan
555381 yeah and were about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them nowhere effing near in other words
555382 please take it off you wouldnt be talking like this if you hadnt been wearing it all day
555383 dyou think i havent noticed the two of you whispering behind my back dyou think i didnt guess you were thinking this stuff
555384 you said it too you said you were disappointed you said youd thought he had a bit more to go on than
555385 i was only saying she was with the others they were with hagrid
555386 yeah i get it you dont care and what about the rest of my family the weasleys dont need another kid injured did you hear that
555387 i dont think it means anything new has happened anything we dont know about think ron bills already scared plenty of people must have seen that george has lost an ear by now and youre supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit im sure thats all he meant
555388 go back to them pretend youre got over your spattergroit and mummyll be able to feed you up and
555389 i know that but it isnt a rune and its not in the syllabary either all along i thought it was a picture of an eye but i dont think it is its been inked in look somebodys drawn it there it isnt really part of the book think have you ever seen it before
555390 isnt it the same symbol lunas dad was wearing round his neck
555391 ive never heard that grindelwald had a mark theres no mention of it in anything ive ever read about him
555392 well like i say krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at durmstrang and grindelwald put it there
555393 thats very odd if its a symbol of dark magic whats it doing in a book of childrens stories
555394 and youd think scrimgeour would have recognized it he was minister he ought to have been expert on dark stuff
555395 i know perhaps he thought it was an eye just like i did all the other stories have little pictures over the titles
555396 ive been thinking i i want to go to godrics hollow
555397 yes ive been wondering that too i really think well have to
555398 of course i did you want to go to godrics hollow i agree i think we should i mean i cant think of anywhere else it could be either itll be dangerous but the more i think about it the more likely it seems its there
555399 i mightve opened it you know when i bought it just the once
555400 well as the village is named after him id have thought you might have made the connection
555401 because professor bagshot doesnt cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century but you see godrics hollow godric gryffindor gryffindors sword dont you think dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection
555402 ginnys great aunt at the wedding the one who said you had skinny ankles
555403 yeah he might have done so are we going to go to godrics hollow
555404 yes but well have to think it through carefully harry
555405 well need to practice disapparating together under the invisibility cloak for a start and perhaps disillusionment charms would be sensible too unless you think we should go the whole hog and use polyjuice potion in that case well need to collect hair from somebody i actually think wed better do that harry the thicker our disguises the better
555406 oh come on we dont look like us and theres no one around
555407 they theyll be in there wont they your mum and dad i can see the graveyard behind it
555408 look at this its an abbott could be some long lost relation of hannahs
555409 im going to keep looking for my parents all right
555410 isnt that a death eater idea why is that there
555411 it doesnt mean defeating death in the way the death eaters mean it harry
555412 it means you know living beyond death living after death
555413 theres someone there someone watching us i can tell there over by the bushes
555414 muggles whove just been laying flowers on your parents grave harry im sure theres someone over there
555415 or a bird if it was a death eater wed be dead by now but lets get out of here and we can put the cloak back on
555416 maybe its like the injuries from dark magic and you cant repair the damage
555417 youre not going to go inside it looks unsafe it might oh harry look
555418 look at the size of her i think we could overpower her if we had to
555419 listen i should have told you i knew she wasnt all there
555420 this picture hermione its the thief the thief who stole from gregorovitch please
555421 why did you ask us to come with you mrs miss bagshot
555422 oh right hermione i think she wants me to go upstairs with her
555423 maybe dumbledore told her to give the sword to me and only to me
555424 lily take harry and go its him go run ill hold him off
555425 i had to use a hover charm to get you into your bunk i couldnt
555426 in my bag i think we should keep it off for a while
555427 we shouldnt have gone to godrics hollow its my fault its all my fault hermione im sorry
555428 its not you fault i wanted to go too i really thought dumbledore might have left the sword there for you
555429 what happened harry what happened when she took you upstairs was the snake hiding somewhere did it just come out and kill her and attack you
555430 she was the snake or the snake was her all along
555431 bathilda mustve been dead a while the snake was was inside her you know who put it there in godrics hollow to wait you were right he knew id go back
555432 she didnt want to talk in front of you because it was parseltongue all parseltongue and i didnt realize but of course i could understand her
555433 it wasnt supposed to kill me just keep me there till you know who came
555434 youre the one who needs sleep no offense but you look terrible im fine ill keep watch for a while wheres my wand
555435 harry i dont think were going to be able to
555436 remember remember ron when he broke his wand crashing the car it was never the same again he had to get a new one
555437 well ill just borrow yours for now then while i keep watch
555438 harry you wanted to know who that man in the picture was well ive got the book
555439 it was in bathildas sitting room just lying there this note was sticking out of the top of it
555440 no hermione i know it was an accident you were trying to get us out of there alive and you were incredible id be dead if you hadnt been there to help me
555441 ran wild course with his mum and dad gone youd have felt sorry for him only he kept chucking goat dung at my head i dont think albus was fussed about him i never saw them together anyway
555442 whatever he became later naturally i introduced him to poor albus who was missing the company of lads his own age the boys took to each other at once
555443 yes even after theyd spent all day in discussion both such brilliant young boys they got on like a cauldron on fire id sometimes hear an owl tapping at gellerts bedroom window delivering a letter from albus an idea would have struck him and he had to let gellert know immediately
555444 it was poor little ariana dying i think that did it
555445 it came as an awful shock gellert was there in the house when it happened and he came back to my house all of a dither told me he wanted to go home the next day terribly distressed you know so i arranged a portkey and that was the last i saw of him
555446 i think thats the worst bit i know bathilda thought it was all just talk but for the greater good became grindelwalds slogan his justification for all the atrocities he committed later and from that it looks like dumbledore gave him the idea they say for the greater good was even carved over the entrance to nurmengard
555447 i thought youd say they were young they were the same age as we are now and here we are risking our lives to fight the dark arts and there he was in a huddle with his new best friend plotting their rise to power over the muggles
555448 all that right to rule rubbish its magic is might all over again
555449 whatever was wrong with that girl i dont think she was a squib
555450 the dumbledore we thought we knew didnt want to conquer muggles by force
555451 he changed harry he changed its as simple as that maybe he did believe these things when he was seventeen but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the dark arts dumbledore was the one who stopped grindelwald the one who always voted for muggle protection and muggle born rights who fought you know who from the start and who died trying to bring him down
555452 harry im sorry but i think the real reason youre so angry is that dumbledore never told you any of this himself
555453 look what he asked from me hermione risk your life harry and again and again and dont expect me to explain everything just trust me blindly trust that i know what im doing trust me even though i dont trust you never the whole truth never
555454 i dont know who he loved hermione but it was never me this isnt love the mess hes left me in he shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with gellert grindelwald than he ever shared with me
555455 thanks for the tea ill finish the watch you get back in the warm
555456 i kept thinking i could hear people moving outside i even though i saw somebody one or twice
555457 the snow the dark it plays tricks on your eyes but perhaps we ought to disapparate under the invisibility cloak just in case
555458 i came camping here once with my mum and dad
555459 panted ron holding up the horcrux which swung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis
555460 what no of course not i thought it was you doing it
555461 but i dont understand how did you get here how did you find us
555462 ive been looking for you for hours its a big forest isnt it and i was just thinking id have to go kip under a tree and wait for morning when i saw that dear coming and you following
555463 i did think i saw something move over there but i was running to the pool at the time because youd gone in and you hadnt come up so i wasnt going to make a detour to hey
555464 because you got the sword out of the pool i think its supposed to be you
555465 and you will stab it straightaway okay because whatevers in there will put up a fight the bit of riddle in the diary tried to kill me
555466 lets get rid of the damn thing its been months
555467 i cant handle it im not making excuses for what i was like but it affects me worse than it affects you and hermione it made me think stuff stuff that i was thinking anyway but it made everything worse i cant explain it and then id take it off and id get my head straight again and then id have to put the effing thing back on i cant do it harry
555468 you can youve just got the sword i know its supposed to be you who uses it please just get rid of it ron
555469 i have seen your dreams ronald weasley and i have seen your fears all you desire is possible but all that you dread is also possible
555470 echoed the riddle hermione who was more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real hermione she swayed cackling before ron who looked horrified yet transfixed the sword hanging pointlessly at his side
555471 crooned riddle hermione and she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around riddle harry wrapping him in a close embrace their lips met
555472 i love her like a sister and i reckon that she feels the same way about me its always been like that i thought you knew
555473 getting the sword finishing off the horcrux saving my life
555474 that makes me sound a lot cooler than i was
555475 stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was
555476 all weve got to do is find that tent again
555477 its okay everythings fine more than fine im great theres someone here
555478 i cam running after you i called you i begged you to come back
555479 rack your brains ron that should only take a couple of seconds
555480 i dont care what hes done weeks and weeks we could have been
555481 i wanted to come back the minute id disapparated but i walked straight into a gang of snatchers hermione and i couldnt go anywhere
555482 theyre everywhere gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up muggle borns and blood traitors theres a reward from the ministry for everyone captured i was on my own and i look like i might be school age they got really excited thought i was a muggle born in hiding i had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the ministry
555483 told them i was stan shunpike first person i could think of
555484 they werent the brightest one of them was definitely part troll the smell of him
555485 anyway they had a row about whether i was stan or not it was a bit pathetic to be honest but there were still five of them and only one of me and theyd taken my wand then two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted i managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach grabbed his wand disarmed the bloke holding mine and disapparated i didnt do it so well splinched myself again
555486 and i came out miles from where you were by the time i got back to that bit of riverbank where wed been you were gone
555487 you must have been simply terrified meanwhile we went to godrics hollow and lets think what happened there harry oh yes snake turned up it nearly killed both of us and then you know who himself arrived and missed us by about a second
555488 imagine losing fingernails harry that really puts our sufferings into perspective doesnt it
555489 how exactly did you find us tonight thats important once we know well be able to make sure were not visited by anyone else we dont want to see
555490 i dont know how it works or why it happened then and not any other time because ive been wanting to come back ever since i left but i was listening to the radio really early on christmas morning and i heard i heard you
555491 no i heard you coming out of my pocket your voice
555492 my name ron and you said something about a wand
555493 and it didnt seem different or anything but i was sure id heard you so i clicked it and the light went out in my room but another light appeared right outside the window
555494 it was a ball of light kind of pulsing and bluish like that light you get around a portkey you know
555495 i grabbed my stuff and packed it then i put on my rucksack and went out into the garden
555496 the little ball of light was hovering there waiting for me and when i came out it bobbed along a bit and i followed it behind the shed and then it well it went inside me
555497 right to my chest and then it just went straight through it was here
555498 i could feel it it was hot and once it was inside me i knew what i was supposed to do i knew it would take me where i needed to go so i disapparated and came out on the side of a hill there was snow everywhere
555499 we spent two nights there and the second night i kept thinking i could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out
555500 your protective spells work anyway because i couldnt see you and i couldnt hear you i was sure you were around though so in the end i got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear i thought youd have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent
555501 weve been disapparating under the invisibility cloak as an extra precaution and we left really early because as harry says wed heard somebody blundering around
555502 i kept hoping youd appear but when it started to get dark i knew i must have missed you so i clicked the deluminator again the blue light came out and went inside me and i disapparated and arrived here in these woods i still couldnt see you so i just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end and harry did well i saw the doe first obviously
555503 couldnt you see who was casting it didnt you see anyone and it led you to the sword i cant believe this then what happened
555504 did you just say now that you got away from the snatchers with a spare wand
555505 here i figured its always handy to have a backup
555506 couldve been worse remember those birds she set on me
555507 someone sent that doe someones on our side one horcrux down mate
555508 oh yeah well its just a bad habit weve slipped into
555509 but the names been jinxed harry thats how they track people using his name breaks protective enchantments it causes some kind of magical disturbance its how they found us in tottenham court road
555510 yeah a bunch of death eaters cornered him bill said but he fought his way out hes on the run now just like us
555511 his patronus is a lynx we saw it at the wedding remember
555512 i saw it happen i saw the body hes definitely gone anyway his patronus was a phoenix not a doe
555513 same reason he didnt give it to you while he was alive same reason he left you an old snitch and hermione a book of kids stories
555514 sometimes ive thought when ive been a bit hacked off he was having a laugh or or he just wanted to make it more difficult but i dont think so not anymore he knew what he was doing when he gave me the deluminator didnt he he well
555515 speaking of dumbledore have you heard what skeeter wrote about him
555516 the spider gave a little shiver bouncing slightly in the web
555517 xenophilius lovegood lunas father i want to go and talk to him
555518 i know viktor said it was grindelwalds mark but it was definitely on that old grave in godrics hollow and the dates on the headstone were long before grindelwald came along and now this well we cant ask dumbledore or grindelwald what it means i dont even know whether grindelwalds still alive but we can ask mr lovegood he was wearing the symbol at the wedding im sure this is important harry
555519 but it keeps appearing harry dumbledore left me how do you know were not supposed to find out about the sign
555520 we keep trying to convince ourselves dumbledore left us secret signs and clues
555521 i think hermiones right i think we ought to go and see lovegood
555522 lovegoods on your side harry s been for you all along it keeps telling everyone theyve got to help you
555523 but dont you think if it was dumbledore would have told me about it before he died
555524 maybe maybe its something you need to find out for yourself
555525 but i still think we ought to talk to mr lovegood a symbol that links dumbledore grindelwald and godrics hollow harry im sure we ought to know about this
555526 only once weve seen lovegood lets try and look for some more horcruxes shall we where do the lovegoods live anyway do either of you know
555527 i dunno exactly where but mum and dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them shouldnt be hard to find
555528 you only agreed to try and get back in her good books
555529 and this is a bit of both cheer up its the christmas holidays lunall be home
555530 its weird being this near but not going to visit
555531 well its not like you havent just seen them you were there for christmas
555532 do you think i was going to go back there and tell them all id walked out on you yeah fred and george wouldve been great about it and ginny shed have been really understanding
555533 bill and fleurs new place shell cottage bills always been decent to me he he wasnt impressed when he heard what id done but he didnt go on about it he knew i was really sorry none of the rest of the family know i was there bill told mum he and fleur werent going home for christmas because they wanted to spend it alone you know first holiday after they were married i dont think fleur minded you know how much she hates celestina warbeck
555534 do you think its theirs and theyve gone away for christmas
555535 listen ive got a feeling youd be able to tell who lived there if you looked through the lovegoods window lets try the next lot of hills
555536 thats got to be lunas house who else would live in a place like that it looks like a giant rook
555537 what what is it who are you what do you want
555538 but harry its an erumpent horn its a class b tradeable material and its an extraordinary dangerous thing to have in a house
555539 theres a description in fantastic beasts and where to find them mr lovegood you need to get rid of it straightaway dont you know it can explode at the slightest touch
555540 is a shy and highly magical creature and its horn
555541 two weeks ago from a delightful young wizard who knew my interest in the exquisite snorkack a christmas surprise for my luna now
555542 arent you the one who keeps telling everyone its their first duty to help harry
555543 luna is down at the stream fishing for freshwater plimpies she she will like to see you ill go and call her and then yes very well i shall try to help you
555544 hes probably worried about whatll happen to them if the death eaters find out i was here
555545 awful old hypocrite telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm our of it himself and for heavens sake keep away from that horn
555546 modeled fittingly enough upon the head of the beautiful rowens ravenclaw wit beyond measure is a mans greatest treasure
555547 these are the wrackpurt siphons to remove all sources of distraction from the thinkers immediate area
555548 luna is down beyond bottom bridge she is most excited that you are here she ought not to be too long she has caught nearly enough plumpies to make soup for all of us
555549 its about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at bill and fleurs wedding mr lovegood we wondered what it meant
555550 are you referring to the sign of the deathly hallows
555551 you havent heard of them im not surprised very very few wizards believe witness that knuckle headed young man at your brothers wedding
555552 who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well known dark wizard such ignorance there is nothing dark about the hallows at least not in that crude sense one simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers in the hope that they might help one with the quest
555553 i assume that you are familiar with the tale of the three brothers
555554 well well mr potter the whole thing starts with the tale of the three brothers i have a copy somewhere
555555 ive got a copy mr lovegood ive got it right here
555556 well then why dont you read it out aloud much the best way to make sure we all understand
555557 sorry i just think its a bit spookier if its midnight
555558 yeah because we really need a bit more fear in our lives
555559 and then death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like
555560 sometimes he gets bored of running at them flapping his arms and shrieking sorry hermione
555561 in due course the brothers separated each for his own destination
555562 the first brother traveled on for a week more and reaching a distant village sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel
555563 that very night another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay wine sodden upon his bed the thief took the wand and for good measure slit the oldest brothers throat
555564 and so death took the first brother for his own
555565 meanwhile the second brother journeyed to his own home where he lived alone
555566 yet she was sad and cold separated from him as by a veil though she had returned to the mortal world she did not truly belong there and suffered finally the second brother driven mad with hopeless longing killed himself so as to truly join her
555567 and so death took the second brother from his own
555568 but though death searched for the third brother for many years he was never able to find him
555569 but theres no mention of the words deathly hallows in the story
555570 that is a childrens tale told to amuse rather than to instruct those of us who understand these matters however recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects or hallows which if united will make the possessor master of death
555571 you are i gather not unintelligent but painfully limited narrow close minded
555572 we all know that there are such things as invisibility cloaks
555573 none of you have ever seen such a thing the possessor would be immeasurably rich would he not
555574 say the cloak existed what about that stone mr lovegood the thing you call the resurrection stone
555575 but thats im sorry but thats completely ridiculous how can i
555576 i am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little
555577 the elder wand is the hallow that is most easily traced because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand
555578 which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner if he is to be truly master of it
555579 surely you have heard of the way the wand came to egbert the egregious after his slaughter of emeric the evil of how godelot died in his own cellar after his son hereward took the wand from him of the dreadful loxias who took the wand from baraabas deverill whom he had killed the bloody trail of the elder wand is splattered across the pages of wizarding history
555580 so where do you think the elder wand is now
555581 who knows where the elder wand lies hidden the trail goes cold with arcus and livius who can say which of them really defeated loxias and which took the wand and who can say who may have defeated them history alas does not tell us
555582 mr lovegood does the peverell family have anything to do with the deathly hallows
555583 i thought you were new to the hallows quest many of us questers believe that the peverells have everything
555584 that was the name on the grave with the mark on it in godrics hollow
555585 the sign of the death hallows on ignotuss grave is conclusive proof
555586 why that the three brothers in the story were actually the three peverell brothers antioch cadmus and ignotus that they were the original owners of the hallows
555587 its a pile of utter rubbish this cant be what the sign really means this must just be his weird take on it what a waste of time
555588 nah that storys just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons isnt it dont go looking for trouble dont go pick fights dont go messing around with stuff thats best left alone just keep your head down mind your own business and youll be okay come to think of it
555589 maybe that storys why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky
555590 one of those superstitions isnt it may born witches will marry muggles jinx by twilight undone by midnight wand of cider never prosper you must have heard them my mums full of them
555591 its just a morality tale its obvious which gift is best which one youd choose
555592 but you wouldnt need to be invisible if you had the wand
555593 and its helped us rather a lot in case you hadnt noticed
555594 only if you were prat enough to go dancing around waving it over your head and singing ive got an unbeatable want come and have a go if you think youre hard enough
555595 you know the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra powerful wands for hundreds of years
555596 the deathstick the wand of destiny they crop up under different names through the centuries usually in the possession of some dark wizard whos boasting about them professor binns mentioned some of them but oh its all nonsense wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other peoples
555597 that those wants the deathstick and the wand of destiny arent the same want surfacing over the centuries under different names
555598 what if theyre all really the elder wand made by death
555599 well if you could bring people back we could have sirius mad eye dumbledore my parents
555600 but according to beedle the bard they wouldnt want to come back would they
555601 i dont suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead have there
555602 i dont think anyone except mr lovegood could kid themselves thats possible beedle probably took the idea from the sorcerers stone you know instead of a stone to make you immortal a stone to reverse death
555603 of course not were invisible when were under it ron
555604 but all the stuff he said about other cloaks and theyre not exactly ten a knut you know is true its never occurred to me before but ive heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old or them being ripped apart by spells so theyve got holes harrys was owned by his dad so its not exactly new is it but its just perfect
555605 harry what are you doing i dont think you should look around when hes not here
555606 i ive already told you she is down at the botions bridge fishing for plimpies
555607 so why have you only laid that tray for four
555608 her clothes are gone her bed hasnt been slept in where is she and why do you keep looking out of the window
555609 is that what you were doing when you went into the garden mr
555610 they will be here any moment i must save luna i cannot lose luna you must not leave
555611 didnt i tell you there was no need to hurry travers
555612 didnt i tell you this nutter was just raving as usual
555613 i told you last week lovegood we werent coming back for anything less than some solid information remember last week when you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress and the week before
555614 when you thought wed give her back if you offered us proof there are cumple
555615 and now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up
555616 the place looks like its about to fall in selwyn
555617 the stairs are completely blocked could try clearing it might bring the place down
555618 you have never seen potter in your life have you thought youd lure us here to kill us did you and you think youll get your girl back like this
555619 please please give me luna just let me have luna
555620 if you get up those stairs and bring me down harry potter but if this is a plot if its a trick if youve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us well see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury
555621 give me the invisibility cloak ron youre going to put it on
555622 please ron harry hold on tight to my hand ron grab my shoulder
555623 hermione youre a genius a total genius i cant believe we got out of that
555624 thats why i wanted the death eaters to get a glimpse of harry before we left so they knew xenophilius hadnt been lying
555625 youre supposed to be in bed with spattergrolt ron theyve kidnapped luna because her father supported harry what would happen to your family if they knew youre with him
555626 well if theyre telling the truth and shes still alive
555627 shes tough luna much tougher than youd think shes probably teaching all the inmates about wrackspurts and nargles
555628 if he hadnt just tried to sell us to the death eaters yeah
555629 harry you were right it was godrics hollow all over again a complete waste of time the deathly hallows such rubbish although actually
555630 he might have made it all up mightnt he he probably doesnt believe in the deathly hallows at all he just wanted to keep us talking until the death eaters arrived
555631 its a damn sight harder making stuff up when youre under stress than youd think i found that out when the snatchers caught me it was much easier pretending to be stan because i knew a bit about him than inventing a whole new person old lovegood was under loads of pressure trying to make sure we stayed put i reckon he told us the truth or what he thinks is the truth just to keep us talking
555632 even if he was being honest i never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life
555633 the chamber of secrets was supposed to be a myth wasnt it
555634 a story about how humans are frightened of death if surviving was as simple as hiding under the invisibility cloak wed have everything we need already
555635 i dont know we could do with an unbeatable wand
555636 you said there have been loads of wands the deathstick and whatever they were called
555637 all right even if you want to kid yourself the elder wands real what about the resurrection stone
555638 when my wand connected with it made my mum and dad appear and cedric
555639 but they werent really back from the dead were they
555640 those kind of of pale imitations arent the same as truly bringing someone back to life
555641 but she the girl in the tale didnt really come back did she
555642 i looked him up after i saw the mark on his grave if hed been anyone famous or done anything important im sure hed be in one of our books the only place ive managed to find the name peverell is i borrowed it from kreacher
555643 it lists the pure blood families that are now extinct in the male line apparently the peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish
555644 centuries ago in the case of the peverells they could still have descendents though theyd just be called something different
555645 sorry said ron and hermione together grandfather in the pensieve with dumbledore marvolo gaunt said he was descended from the peverells
555646 the ring the ring that became the horcrux marvolo gaunt said it had the peverell coat of arms on it i saw him waving it in the bloke from the ministrys face he nearly shoved it up his nose
555647 there was nothing fancy on there as far as i could see maybe a few scratches i only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open
555648 blimey you reckon it was this sign again the sign of the hallows
555649 but harry if youre thinking what i think youre think
555650 hermione it fits of its own accord i know the sign of the deathly hallows was on that stone gaunt said he was descended from the peverells
555651 a minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly
555652 what did dumbledore do with it after he broke it open
555653 but harrys imagination was racing ahead far beyond ron and hermiones
555654 hes my ancestor im descended from the third brother it all makes sense
555655 he felt armed in certainty in his belief in the hallows as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two
555656 read it dumbledore had the cloak hermione why else would he want it he didnt need a cloak he could perform a disillusionment charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one
555657 its in here he left me the ring its in the snitch
555658 and chasing the third but he doesnt realize he just thinks its a powerful wand
555659 im sorry but i think youve got this wrong all wrong
555660 please just answer me this if the deathly hallows really existed and dumbledore knew about them knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of death harry why wouldnt he have told you why
555661 but you said it hermione youve got to find out about them for yourself its a quest
555662 but i only said that to try and persuade you to come to the lovegoods
555663 dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself he let me try my strength take risks this feels like the kind of thing hed do
555664 i dunno i mean bits of it sort of fit together
555665 i think were supposed to get rid of horcruxes harry thats what dumbledore told us to do maybe maybe we should forget about this hallows business
555666 were not the one with an obsession harry were the ones trying to do what dumbledore wanted us to do
555667 i thought it was you know who we were supposed to be fighting
555668 upper flagley is a wizarding village he mightve wanted to live there lets go and have a poke around
555669 but not until march did luck favor ron at last harry was sitting in the tent entrance on guard duty staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground when ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent
555670 ive got it ive got it password was albus get in here harry
555671 apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those charming death eaters
555672 theyve all got code names but you can usually tell
555673 lets take a moment to report those deaths that the dont think important enough to mention it is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of ted tonks and dirk cresswell
555674 a goblin by the name of gornuk was also killed
555675 meanwhile in gaddley a muggle family of five has been found dead in their home
555676 finally we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of bathilda bagshot have been discovered in godrics hollow the evidence is that she died several months ago the order of the phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by dark magic
555677 listeners id like to invite you now to join us in a minutes silence in memory of ted tonks dirk cresswell bathilda bagshot gornuk and the unnamed but no less regretted muggles murdered by the death eaters
555678 and now we can return to regular contributor royal for an update on how the new wizarding order is affecting the muggle world
555679 muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties
555680 however we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect muggle friends and neighbors often without the muggles knowledge id like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example perhaps by casting a protective charm over any muggle dwellings in your street many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken
555681 and what would you say royal to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times it should be wizards first asked lee
555682 id say that its one short step from wizards first to purebloods first and then to death eaters
555683 were all human arent we every human life is worth the same and worth saving
555684 excellently put royal and youve got my vote for minister of magic if we ever get out of this mess
555685 and now over to romulus for our popular feature pals of potter
555686 romulus do you maintain as you have every time youve appeared on our program that harry potter is still alive
555687 there is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the death eaters if it had happened because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime the boy who lived remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting the triumph of good the power of innocence the need to keep resisting
555688 and what would you say to harry if you knew he was listening romulus
555689 and id tell him to follow his instincts which are good and nearly always right
555690 and our usual update on those friends of harry potters who are suffering for their allegiance
555691 well as regular listeners will know several of the more outspoken supporters of harry potter have now been imprisoned including xenophilius lovegood erstwhile editor of
555692 we have also heard within the last few hours that rubeus hagrid
555693 well known gamekeeper at hogwarts school has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of hogwarts where he is rumored to have hosted a support harry potter party in his house however hagrid was not taken into custody and is we believe on the run
555694 i suppose it helps when escaping from death eaters if youve got a sixteen foot high half brother
555695 may i just add that while we here at applaud hagrids spirit we would urge even the most devoted of harrys supporters against following hagrids lead support harry potter parties are unwise in the present climate
555696 so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to and now lets move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as harry potter we like to refer to him as the chief death eater and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him id like to introduce a new correspondent rodent
555697 im not being rodent no way i told you i wanted to be rapier
555698 oh all right then rapier could you please give us your take on the various stories weve been hearing about the chief death eater
555699 as our listeners will know unless theyve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic mind you if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine we must have a good nineteen you know whos running around the place
555700 the air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself
555701 so people lets try and calm down a bit things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well for instance this new idea that you know who can kill people with a single glance from his eyes thats a listeners one simple test check whether the thing thats glaring at you has got legs if it has its safe to look into its eyes although if it really is you know who thats still likely to be the last thing you ever do
555702 well who wouldnt want a nice little holiday after all the hard work hes been putting in
555703 point is people dont get lulled into a false sense of security thinking hes out of the country maybe he is maybe he isnt but the fact remains he can move faster than severus snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to so dont count on him being a long way away if youre planning to take any risks i never thought id hear myself say it but safety first
555704 listeners that brings us to the end of another we dont know when it will be possible to broadcast again but you can be sure we shall be back keep twiddling those dials the next password will be mad eye keep each other safe keep faith good night
555705 hes abroad hes still looking for the wand i knew it
555706 come on hermione why are you so determined not to admit it
555707 i told you harry i told you we cant say it anymore weve got to put the protection back around us quickly its how they find
555708 we know youre in there youve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we dont care who we curse
555709 your boyfriends going to have worse than that done to him if hes on my list
555710 delicious girl what a treat i do enjoy the softness of the skin
555711 ill be needing butterbeer to wash this one down what happened to you ugly
555712 we know stan shunpike es put a bit of work our way
555713 so youre related to blood traitors even if youre not a mudblood and lastly your pretty little friend
555714 oh im not going to bite just yet well see if shes a bit quicker at remembering her name than barny who are you girly
555715 but the ole lot of em look like they could still be ogwarts age
555716 and you decided to go camping and you thought just for a laugh youd use the dark lords name
555717 you know who used to like using the dark lords name weasley
555718 well they dont show the dark lord proper respect so the names been tabooed a few order members have been tracked that way well see bind them up with the other two prisoners
555719 a mudblood a runaway goblin and these truants you checked their names on the list yet scabior
555720 so you arent wanted then vernon or are you on that list under a different name what house were you in at hogwarts
555721 funny ow they all thinks we wants to ear that
555722 but none of em can tell us where the common room is
555723 you enter through the wall its full of skulls and stuff and its under the lake so the lights all green
555724 well well looks like we really ave caught a little slytherin
555725 good for you vernon cause there aint a lot of mudblood slytherins whos your father
555726 if youre telling the truth ugly youve got nothing to fear from a trip to the ministry i expect your fatherll reward us just for picking you up
555727 oh very nice indeed looks goblin made that where did you get something like this
555728 ang on a minute greyback look at this in the
555729 you know what little girly this picture looks a hell of a lot like you
555730 dont touch it harry yelled he could not stop himself he thought he might be sick from the pain of it
555731 theyll take the credit and we wont get a look in i say we take him straight to you know who
555732 i havent got they say hes using the malfoys place as a base well take the boy there
555733 completely sure its him cause if it aint greyback were dead
555734 i say thats potter and him plus his wand thats two hundred thousand galleons right there but if youre too gutless to come along any of you its all for me and with any luck ill get the girl thrown in
555735 all right were in and what about the rest of em greyback whatll we do with em
555736 might as well take the lot weve got two mudbloods thats another ten galleons give me the sword as well if theyre rubies thats another small fortune right there
555737 how do we get in theyre locked greyback i cant blimey
555738 so you have come i thought you would one day but your journey was pointless i never had it
555739 were here to see he who must not be named
555740 if you look a bit closer youll see is scar
555741 my son draco is home for his easter holidays if that is harry potter he will know
555742 draco if we are the ones who hand potter over to the dark lord everything will be forgiv
555743 now we wont be forgetting who actually caught him i hope mr malfoy
555744 completely sure that it is potter before we summon the dark lord they say this is his
555745 but it does not resemble ollivanders description if we are mistaken if we call the dark lord here for nothing remember what he did to rowle and dolohov
555746 yes yes she was in madam malkins with potter i saw her picture in the
555747 its them potters friends draco look at him isnt it arthur weasleys son whats his name
555748 and beside her we think potter potter and his friends caught at last
555749 are you sure well then the dark lord must be informed at once
555750 you lost your authority when you lost your wand lucius how dare you take your hands off me
555751 this is nothing to do with you you did not capture the boy
555752 but its us that caught potter and its us thatll be claiming the gold
555753 take your gold filthy scavenger what do i want with gold
555754 do not touch it we shall all perish if the dark lord comes now
555755 its not yours missus its mine i reckon i found it
555756 if you havent got the guts to finish them then leave them in the courtyard for me
555757 be quiet the situation is graver than you can possibly imagine cissy we have a very serious problem
555758 if it is indeed potter he must not be harmed
555759 the dark lord wishes to dispose of potter himself but if he finds out i must i must know
555760 the prisoners must be placed in the cellar while i think what to do
555761 this is my house bella you dont give orders in my
555762 do it you have no idea of the danger were in
555763 blood traitor is next to mudblood in my book take them downstairs greyback and make sure they are secure but do nothing more to them yet
555764 reckon shell let me have a bit of the girl when shes finished with her
555765 id say ill get a bite or two wouldnt you ginger
555766 we need a plan stop yelling we need to get these ropes off
555767 yes its me oh no i didnt want you to be caught
555768 oh yes i expect so theres an old nail we use if we need to break anything just a moment
555769 mr ollivander have you got the nail if you just move over a little bit i think it was beside the water jug
555770 im going to ask you again where did you get this sword
555771 in my pocket theres a deluminator and its full of light
555772 youre lying filthy mudblood and i know it you have been inside my vault at gringotts tell the truth
555773 what else did you take what else have you got tel me the truth or i swear i shall run you through with this knife
555774 the cellar is completely escape proof i tried at first mr ollivander has been here for a long time hes tried everything
555775 did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you
555776 weve never been inside your vault it isnt the real sword its a copy just a copy
555777 draco fetch the goblin he can tell us whether the sword is real or not
555778 you must tell them that swords a fake they mustnt know its the real one griphook please
555779 stand back line up against the back wall dont try anything or ill kill you
555780 go both of you well see you at bill and fleurs
555781 kill me then voldemort i welcome death but my death will not bring you what you seek there is so much you do not understand
555782 did you hear that what was that noise in the cellar
555783 said ron pointing the wand at the silver hand but nothing happened pettigrew dropped to his knees and at the same moment hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead
555784 we can dispose of the mudblood greyback take her if you want her
555785 he roared pointing wormtails wand at bellatrix and hers flew into the air and was caught by harry who had sprinted after ron
555786 and lucius malfoy collapsed onto the hearth jets of light flew from dracos narcissas and greybacks wands harry threw himself to the floor rolling behind a sofa to avoid them
555787 drop them or well see exactly how filthy her blood is
555788 draco pick them up the dark lord is coming harry potter your death approaches
555789 cissy i think we ought to tie these little heroes up again while greyback takes care of miss mudblood i am sure the dark lord will not begrudge you the girl greyback after what you have done tonight
555790 the werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground
555791 how dare you take a witchs wand how dare you defy your masters
555792 dobby is a free elf and dobby has come to save harry potter and his friends
555793 thank you so much dobby for rescuing me from that cellar its so unfair that you had to die when you were so good and brave ill always remember what you did for us i hope youre happy now
555794 lucky that ginnys on holiday if shed been at hogwarts they could have taken her before we reached her now we know shes safe too
555795 moved them to muriels the death eaters know rons with you now theyre bound to target the family dont apologize
555796 it was always a matter of time dads been saying so for months were the biggest blood traitor family there is
555797 fidelius charm dads secret keeper and weve done it on this cottage too im secret keeper here none of us can go to work but thats hardly the most important thing now once ollivander and griphook are well enough well move them to muriels too there isnt much room here but shes got
555798 i need both of them here i need to talk to them its important
555799 but it cant wait i need to talk to them now privately and separately its urgent
555800 you turn up here with a dead house elf and a half conscious goblin hermione looks as though shes been tortured and rons just refused to tell me anything
555801 youre in the order bill you know dumbledore left us a mission were not supposed to talk about it to anyone else
555802 all right who do you want to talk to first
555803 you were amazing coming up with that story when she was hurting you like that
555804 that i was the goblin who showed you to your vault the first time you ever visited gringotts
555805 i remember harry potter even amongst goblins you are very famous
555806 i watched you from the window of the bedroom next door
555807 well i need some help griphook and you can give it to me
555808 the same day i first met you griphook my birthday seven years ago
555809 well the vault we need to get into isnt empty and im guessing its protection will be pretty powerful
555810 no chance at all if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours yeah i know i remember
555811 but im not trying to get myself any treasure im not trying to take anything for personal gain can you believe that
555812 if there was a wizard of whom i would believe that they did not seek personal gain
555813 it would be you harry potter goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night not from wand carriers
555814 that is immaterial wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand lore with other magical beings they deny us the possibility of extending our powers
555815 you wont tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do
555816 this isnt about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature
555817 but it is it is precisely that as the dark lord becomes ever more powerful your race is set still more firmly above mine gringotts falls under wizarding rule house elves are slaughtered and who amongst the wand carriers protests
555818 we protest and im hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf griphook im a mudblood
555819 mudblood and proud of it ive got no higher position under this new order than you have griphook it was me they chose to torture back at the malfoys
555820 did you know that it was harry who set dobby free
555821 did you know that weve wanted elves to be freed for years
555822 you cant want you know who defeated more than we do griphook
555823 the sword that lies inside it is a fake this is the real one
555824 i think that you already know this you asked me to lie for you back there
555825 but the fake sword isnt the only thing in that vault is it
555826 it is against our code to speak of the secrets of gringotts we are the guardians of fabulous treasures we have a duty to the objects placed in our care which were so often wrought by our fingers
555827 we havent got a hope of breaking in without a goblins help youre our one chance
555828 that the skele gro has finished its work i may be able to sleep at last forgive me
555829 are you saying what i think youre saying are you saying theres a horcrux in the lestranges vault
555830 bellatrix was terrified when she thought wed been in there she was beside herself why what did she think wed seen what else did she think we might have taken something she was petrified you know who would find out about
555831 but i thought we were looking for places been places hes done something important
555832 he never had gold there when he was younger because nobody left him anything he would have seen the bank from the outside though the first time he ever went to diagon alley
555833 i think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a gringotts vault i think hed have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the wizarding world and dont forget he trusted bellatrix and her husband they were his most devoted servants before he fell and they went looking for him after he vanished he said it night he came back i heard him
555834 i dont think hed have told bellatrix it was a horcrux though he never told lucius malfoy the truth about the diary he probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault the safest place in the world for anything you want to hide hagrid told me except for hogwarts
555835 bits i just wish id understood dumbledore as much but well see come on ollivander now
555836 you rescued us i thought we would die in that place i can never thank you
555837 i am sorry very sorry but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that i know of
555838 twelve and three quarter inches unyielding this wand belonged to bellatrix lestrange
555839 hawthorn and unicorn hair ten inches precisely reasonably springy this was the wand of draco malfoy
555840 then it may be yours of course the manner of taking matters much also depends upon the wand itself in general however where a wand has been won its allegiance will change
555841 that much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore
555842 a person can still use a wand that hasnt chosen them though
555843 oh yes if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument the best results however must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand these connections are complex an initial attraction and then a mutual quest for experience the wand learning from the wizard the wizard from the wand
555844 i think so subtle laws govern wand ownership but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master
555845 chestnut and dragon heartstring nine and a quarter inches brittle i was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping for peter pettigrew yes if you won it it is more likely to do your bidding and do it well than another wand
555846 you ask deep questions mr potter wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic
555847 so it isnt necessary to kill the previous owner to take the possession of a wand
555848 necessary no i should not say that it is necessary to kill
555849 legends about a wand or wands that have been passed from hand to hand by murder
555850 and you know who is interested in it isnt he
555851 he wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands
555852 he tortured me you must understand that the cruciatus curse i i had no choice but to tell him what i knew what i guessed
555853 you told him about the twin cores you said he just had to borrow another wizards wand
555854 mine still beat the borrowed wand do you know why that is
555855 i had never heard of such a thing your wand performed something unique that night the connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare yet why your wand would have snapped the borrowed wand i do not know
555856 we were talking about the other wand the wand that changes hands by murder when you know who realized my wand had done something strange he came back and asked about that other wand didnt he
555857 he wanted to know everything i could tell him about the wand variously known as the deathstick the wand of destiny or the elder wand
555858 had always been happy with the wand i made him yes and phoenix feather thirteen and a half inches until he discovered the connection of the twin cores now he seeks another more powerful wand as the only way to conquer yours
555859 but hell know soon if he doesnt already that mines broken beyond repair
555860 we left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the malfoys hermione if they examine them properly make them re create the spells theyve cast lately theyd see that yours broke mine theyll see that you tried and failed to mend it and theyll realize that ive been using the blackthorn one ever since
555861 the dark lord no longer seeks the elder wand only for your destruction mr potter he is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable
555862 the owner of the elder wand must always fear attack
555863 but the idea of the dark lord in possession of the deathstick is i must admit formidable
555864 you you really think this wand exists then mr ollivander
555865 yes it is perfectly possible to trace the wands course through history there are gaps of course and long ones where it vanishes from view temporarily lost or hidden but always it resurfaces it has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize there are written accounts some of them obscure that i and other wandmakers have made it our business to study they have the ring of authenticity
555866 so you you dont think it can be a fairy tale or a myth
555867 whether it to pass by murder i do not know its history is bloody but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object and arouses such passions in wizards immensely powerful dangerous in the wrong hands and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands
555868 you told you know who that gregorovitch had the elder wand didnt you
555869 you told you know who that gregorovitch had the wand
555870 a rumor years and years ago long before you were born i believe gregorovitch himself started it you can see how good it would be for business that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the elder wand
555871 mr ollivander one last thing and then well let you get some rest what do you know about the deathly hallows
555872 im afraid i dont know what youre talking about is this still something to do with wands
555873 thank you very much well leave you to get some rest now
555874 i really do please get some rest thank you for telling me all of this
555875 i saw you know who trying to find him when he tracked him down he found that gregorovitch didnt have it anymore it was stolen from him by grindelwald how grindelwald found out that gregorovitch had it i dont know but if gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor it cant have been that difficult
555876 and grindelwald used the elder wand to become powerful and at the height of his power when dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him he dueled grindelwald and beat him and he took the elder wand
555877 how long have you known this why have we been wasting time
555878 hermiones right dumbledore didnt want me to have it he didnt want me to take it he wanted me to get the horcruxes
555879 im not supposed to im supposed to get the horcruxes
555880 what if dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand
555881 what if working out what the symbol meant made you worthy to get the hallows
555882 harry if that really is the elder wand how the hell are we supposed to finish off you know who
555883 harry admits he could have imagined the eye dont you harry
555884 if it wasnt dumbledore explain how dobby knew we were in the cellar hermione
555885 i cant but can you explain how dumbledore sent him to us if hes lying in a tomb at hogwarts
555886 arry gripook would like to speak to you e eez in ze smallest bedroom e says e does not want to be overeard
555887 though the goblins of gringotts will consider it base treachery i have decided to help you
555888 ill bet the lestranges have got loads of stuff you can take your pick once we get into the vault
555889 i am not a thief boy i am not trying to procure treasures to which i have no right
555890 wizarding arrogance again that sword was ragnuk the firsts taken from him by godric gryffindor it is a a masterpiece of goblinwork it belongs with the gobl the sword is the price of my hire take it or leave it
555891 we need to discuss this griphook if thats all right could you give us a few minutes
555892 hes having a laugh we cant let him have that sword
555893 wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races but theres no account that i know of that says gryffindor stole the sword
555894 about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them i suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasnt asked for one of our wands
555895 but arguing with griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isnt going to make him more likely to help us is it
555896 hows this we tell griphook we need the sword until we get inside the and then he can have it theres a fake in these isnt there we switch them and give him the fake
555897 hes the only one who realized there had been a swap
555898 is despicable ask for his help then double cross him and you wonder why goblins dont like wizards ron
555899 all right all right it was the only thing i could think of whats your solution then
555900 we need to offer him something else something just as valuable
555901 brilliant ill go and get one of our ancient goblin made swords and you can gift wrap it
555902 griphook maybe gryffindor didnt take the sword how do we know the goblin version of historys right
555903 well tell him he can have the sword after hes helped us get into that vault but well be careful to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it
555904 after weve used it on all of the horcruxes ill make sure he gets it then ill keep my word
555905 i know that but he neednt i wont be lying really
555906 i have your word harry potter that you will give me the sword of gryffindor if i help you
555907 on the occasion i was told to place inside it the false sword it is one of the most ancient chambers the oldest wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level where the vaults are largest and best protected
555908 i never meant you to have to deal with all of this
555909 arry you saved my sisters life i do not forget
555910 mr ollivander leaves for muriels zis evening zat will make zings easier ze goblin
555911 can move downstairs and you ron and dean can take zat room
555912 well be off your hands soon too ron hermione and i we wont need to be here much longer
555913 of course you must not leave you are safe ere
555914 a bit like hippos daddy says only purple and hairy and if you want to call them you have to hum they prefer a waltz nothing too fast
555915 and if you ever come to our house ill be able to show you the horn daddy wrote to me about it but i havent seen it yet because the death eaters took me from the hogwarts express and i never got home for christmas
555916 daddy told me it will probably have re formed by now they mend themselves you know
555917 you were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place
555918 and i wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to bills auntie murie i never returned er tiara
555919 the very least i can do in return for your generous hospitality
555920 ollivander settled in mum and dad say hello ginny sends you all her love fred and george are driving muriel up the wall theyre still operating an owl order business out of her back room it cheered her up to have her tiara back though she said she thought wed stolen it
555921 yes hes trying to re create the lost diadem of ravenclaw
555922 i am a werewolf married to nymphadora tonks and you the secret keeper of shell cottage told me the address and bade me come in an emergency
555923 its a boy weve named him ted after doras father
555924 you yes of course dora quite agrees no one better
555925 i think he looks like dora but she thinks he is like me not much hair it looked black when he was born but i swear its turned ginger in the hour since probably blond by the time i get back andromeda says tonkss hair started changing color the day that she was born
555926 good bye good bye ill try and bring some pictures in a few days time theyll all be so glad to know that ive seen you
555927 i wanted a private word actually harry it hasnt been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people
555928 ive worked for gringotts ever since i left hogwarts as far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins i have goblin friends or at least goblins i know well and like
555929 harry what do you want from griphook and what have you promised him in return
555930 if you have struck any kind of bargain with griphook and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure you must be exceptionally careful goblin notions of ownership payment and repayment are not the same as human ones
555931 dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries but youll know all that from history of magic there has been fault on both sides i would never claim that wizards have been innocent however there is a belief among some goblins and those at gringotts are perhaps most prone to it that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure that they have no respect for goblin ownership
555932 you dont understand harry nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins to a goblin the rightful and true master of any object is the maker not the purchaser all goblin made objects are in goblin eyes rightfully theirs
555933 then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money they have however great difficulty with the idea of goblin made objects passing from wizard to wizard you saw griphooks face when the tiara passed under his eyes he disapproves i believe he thinks as do the fiercest of his kind that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died they consider our habit of keeping goblin made objects passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment little more than theft
555934 is to be very careful what you promise goblins harry it would be less dangerous to break into gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin
555935 i really hate it it feels all wrong it doesnt work properly for me its like a bit of her
555936 this is the wand that tortured nevilles mum and dad and who knows how many other people this is the wand that killed sirius
555937 i wish mr ollivander could have made me another one too
555938 weve just been checking the last minute stuff griphook weve told bill and fleur were leaving tomorrow and weve told them not to get up to see us off
555939 she tasted disgusting worse than gurdyroots okay ron come here so i can do you
555940 right but remember i dont like the beard too long
555941 its not that it gets in the way but i liked my nose a bit shorter try and do it the way you did last time
555942 where are my children what has he done with them you know you know
555943 well i confess i am surprised to see you out and about bellatrix
555944 i heard that the inhabitants of malfoy manor were confined to the house after the ah escape
555945 the dark lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past
555946 perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is travers
555947 it does not matter it will not do so again
555948 while they do nothing but beg i have no objection but one of them actually asked me to plead her case in the ministry last week im a witch sir im a witch let me prove it to you
555949 as if i was going to give her my wand but whose wand
555950 i dont know what rumors you have been listening to travers but you seem sadly misinformed
555951 he speaks very little english but he is in sympathy with the dark lords aims he has traveled here from transylvania to see our new regime
555952 gold filthy gold we cannot live without it yet i confess i deplore the necessity of consorting with our long fingered friends
555953 like i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it
555954 identification i i have never been asked for identification before
555955 they must have been warned there might be an imposter
555956 ah you have had a new wand made madam lestrange
555957 but how could you have done which wandmaker did you use
555958 yes very handsome and is it working well i always think wands require a little breaking in dont you
555959 good good s if you will follow me madam lestrange
555960 forgive me madam but there have been special orders regarding the vault of lestrange
555961 i am aware of the instructions madam lestrange wishes to visit her vault very old family old clients this way please
555962 i dont think i did it strongly enough i dont know
555963 so we need bogrod to control the cart i no long have the authority but there will not be room for the wizard
555964 it washes away all enchantment all magical concealment they know there are imposers in gringotts they have set off defenses against us
555965 we cannot enter the vault without a gringotts goblin and we need the clankers
555966 harry said again his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand
555967 they saw the shield charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway
555968 but even more savage for that however we have the means to control it it has learned what to expect when the clankers come give them to me
555969 it will expect pain when it hears the noise it will retreat and bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault
555970 light your wands cant you and hurry we have little time
555971 everything you touch will burn and multiply but the copies are worthless and if you continue to handle the treasure you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold
555972 remember the cups small and gold its got a badger engraved on it two handles otherwise see if you can spot ravenclaws symbol anywhere the eagle
555973 and how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything
555974 cried hermione who had evidently forgotten in her desperation what griphook had told them during their planning sessions
555975 if you want the sword griphook then youll have to help us more than wait can i touch stuff with the sword hermione give it here
555976 if i can just poke the sword through a handle but how am i going to get up there
555977 ive got to get up there weve got to get rid of it
555978 screeched hermione in an attempt to protect herself ron and the goblins from the burning metal
555979 yelled harry and with a crash he and griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure and the sword flew out of harrys hand
555980 he bellowed and ron and hermione joined in jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins and some toppled over but others advanced and harry saw several wizard guards running around the corner
555981 at least we cant wear it this time thatd look a bit weird hanging around our necks
555982 its a dragon hermione it can look after itself its us we need to worry about
555983 well i dont know how to break this to you
555984 but i think they might have noticed we broke into gringotts
555985 hell know wont he you know who will know we know about his horcruxes
555986 m my lord we t tried to st stop them im impostors my lord broke broke into the into the lestranges vault
555987 it was it was the p potter b boy and the t two accomplices
555988 a a s small golden c cup m my lord
555989 he knows and hes going to check where the others are and the last one
555990 i saw him find out about the cup i i was in his head hes
555991 hes seriously angry and scared too he cant understand how we knew and now hes going to check the others are safe the ring first
555992 no he was concentrating on warning snape he didnt think about exactly where it is
555993 we cant just go we havent got a plan we need to
555994 can you imagine what hes going to do once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone
555995 and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the schools like get under the cloak hermione i want to stick together this time
555996 itll be dark no ones going to notice our feet
555997 we know you are here potter and theres no getting away well find you
555998 they set up that spell to tell them wed come
555999 the dark lord wants potter dead by no hands but his
556000 an dementors wont kill him the dark lord wants potters life nor his soul hell be easier to there were noises of agreement dread filled harry to repel dementors they would have to produce
556001 its him down there down there i saw his patronus it was a stag
556002 so what you send dementors down my street ill send a patronus back atem im not havingem near me ive told you that im not having it
556003 if i want to put my cat out i will and be damned to your curfew
556004 what if i did going to cart me off to azkaban kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door do it then if you want to but i hope for your sakes you havent pressed your little dark marks and summoned him hes not going to like being called here for me and my old cat is he now
556005 and where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pubs closed down what will happen to your
556006 i keep my mouth shut its why you come here isnt it
556007 albus told me what it was been trying to keep
556008 brains like that you could be a death eater son havent i just prove my patronus is a goat
556009 we need to think of the best way to get you out of here cant be done by night you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness caterwauling charms set off theyll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs i dont reckon ill be able to pass of a stag as a goat a second time wait for daybreak when curfew lifts then you can put your cloak back on and set out on foot get right out of hogsmeade up into the mountains and youll be able to disapparate there might see hagrid hes been hiding in a cave up there with grawp ever since they tried to arrest him
556010 is to get as far from here as from here as you can
556011 you dont understand there isnt much time weve got to get into the castle dumbledore i mean
556012 and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans you get away from this school potter and out of the country if you can forget my brother and his clever schemes hes gone where none of this can hurt him and you dont owe him anything
556013 you dont think i understood my own brother think you know albus better than i did
556014 nice job i hope pleasant easy sort of thing youd expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves
556015 the order of the phoenix is finished won its over and anyone whos pretending differents kidding themselves itll never be safe for you here potter he wants you too badly so go abroad go into hiding save yourself best take these two with you
556016 theyll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows theyve been working with you
556017 oh did he now and did he tell you everything was he honest with you
556018 i knew my brother potter he learned secrecy at our mothers knee secrets and lies thats how we grew
556019 thought the sun shone out of my brothers every office he did well so did plenty of people you three included by the looks of it
556020 funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if hed left em well alone
556021 when my sister was six years old she was attacked by three muggle boys theyd seen her doing magic spying through the back garden hedge she was a kid she couldnt control it no witch or wizard can at that age what they saw scared them i expect they forced their way through the hedge and when she couldnt show them the trick they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it
556022 it destroyed her what they did she was never right again she wouldnt use magic but she couldnt get rid
556023 and my father went after the bastards that did it
556024 we had to keep her safe and quiet we moved house put it about she was ill and my mother looked after her and tried to keep her calm and happy was her favourite
556025 not albus he was always up in his bedroom when he was home reading his books
556026 if id been there i could have calmed her down she had one of her rages and my mother wasnt as young as she was and it was an accident ariana couldnt control it but my mother was killed
556027 so that put paid to albuss trip round the world with little doge the pair of em came home for my mothers funeral and then doge went off on his own and albus settled down as head of the family ha
556028 id have looked after her i told him so i didnt care about school id have stayed home and done it take over from my mother bit of a comedown for mr brilliant theres no prizes for looking after your half mad sister stopping her blowing up the house every other day but he did all right for a few weeks till he came
556029 but after a few weeks of it id had enough i had it was nearly time for me to go hack to hogwarts so i told em both of em face to face like i am to you now
556030 i told him youd better give it up now you cant move her shes in no fit state you cant take her with you wherever it is youre planning to go when youre making your clever speeches trying to whip yourselves up a following he didnt like that
556031 grindelwald didnt like that at all he got angry he told me what a
556032 and there was an argument and i pulled my wand and he pulled out his and i had the cruciatus curse used on
556033 and i think she wanted to help but she didnt really know what she was doing and i dont know which of us did it it could have been any of us and she was dead
556034 course grindelwald scarpered he had a bit of a track record already back in his own country and he didnt want ariana
556035 the night that your brother died he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind he started screaming
556036 he thought he was back there with you and grindelwald i know he did
556037 he thought he was watching grindelwald hurting you and ariana it was torture to him if youd seen him then you wouldnt say he was free
556038 how can you be sure potter that my brother wasnt more interested in the greater good than in you how can you be sure you arent dispensable just like my little sister
556039 why didnt he say to him take care of yourself heres how to survive
556040 im of age and im going to keep fighting even if youve given up
556041 won its over and anyone whos pretending differents kidding themselves
556042 i dont say i like it but its the truth
556043 your brother knew how to finish you know who and he passed the knowledge on to me im going to keep going until i succeed or i die dont think i dont know how this might end ive known it for years
556044 if you cant help us well wait till daybreak leave you in peace and try to find a way help us well now would be a great time to mention it
556045 you must know theyve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends dementors
556046 i knew youd come kept telling seamus it was a matter of time
556047 this is nothing seamus is worse youll see shall we get going then oh
556048 ab there might be a couple more people no the way
556049 what dyou mean a couple more longbottom theres a curfew and a camwaulding charm on the whole village
556050 i know thats why theyll be apparating directly into the bar
556051 just send them down the passage when they get here will you thanks a lot
556052 i dont know how to thank you youve saved our lives twice
556053 i might not be able to save em a third time
556054 it isnt on the marauders map is it harry i thought there were only seven passages in and out of school
556055 they sealed off all of those before the start of the year
556056 theres no chance of getting through any of them now not with the curses over the entrances and death eaters and dementors waiting at the exits
556057 never mind that stuff is it true did you break into gringotts did you escape on a dragon its everywhere everyones talking about it terry boot got beaten up by carrow for yelling about it in the great hall at dinner
556058 but what have you been doing people have been saying youve just been on the run harry but i dont think so i think youve been up to something
556059 but tell us about hogwarts neville we havent heard anything
556060 theyre in charge of all discipline they like punishment the carrows
556061 nah they make her look tame the other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the carrows if we do anything wrong they dont though if they can avoid it you can tell they all hate them as much as we do
556062 amycus the bloke he teaches what used to be defense against the dark arts except now its just the dark arts
556063 i refused to do it some people are into it though crabbe and goyle love it first time theyve ever been top in anything i expect
556064 alecto amycuss sister teaches muggle studies which is compulsory for everyone weve all got to listen to her explain how muggles are like animals stupid and dirty and how they drive wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them and how the natural order is being reestablished i got this one
556065 for asking her how much muggle blood she and her brother have got
556066 theres a time and a place for getting a smart mouth
556067 you wouldnt have stood it either the thing is it helps when people stand up to them it gives everyone hope i used to notice that when you did it harry
556068 doesnt matter they dont want to spill too much pure blood so theyll torture us a bit if were mouthy but they wont actually kill us
556069 the only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble they get taken hostage old xeno lovegood was getting a bit so they dragged luna off the train on the way back for christmas
556070 yeah i know she managed to get a message to me
556071 the carrows never rumbled how we were communicating it drove them mad we used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls
556072 we lost luna at christmas and ginny never came back after easter and the three of us were sort of the leaders the carrows seemed to know i was behind a lot of it so they started coming down on me hard and then michael corner went and got caught releasing a first year theyd chained up and they tortured him pretty badly that scared people off
556073 yeah well i couldnt ask people to go through what michael did so we dropped those kinds of stunts but we were still fighting doing underground stuff right up until a couple of weeks ago thats when they decided there was only one way to stop me i suppose and they went for gran
556074 well you can see their thinking it had worked really well kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave i spose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around thing was
556075 they bit off a bit more than they could chew with gran little old witch living alone they probably thought hey didnt need to send anyone particularly powerful anyway
556076 dawlish is still in st mungos and grans on the run she sent me a letter
556077 telling me she was proud of me that im my parents son and to keep it up
556078 only thing was once they realized they had no hold over me they decided hogwarts could do without me after all i dont know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to azkaban either way i knew it was time to disappear
556079 surpassed itself hasnt it the carrows were chasing me and i knew i had just one chance for a hideout i managed to get through the door and this is what i found well it wasnt exactly like this when i arrived it was a load smaller there was only one hammock and just gryffindor hangings but its expanded as more and more of the d a have arrived
556080 its a proper hideout as long as one of us stays in here they cant get at us the door wont open its all down to neville he really
556081 i dont want any carrow supporters to be able to get in and itll do it for you youve just got to make sure you close the loopholes nevilles the man
556082 id been in here about a day and a half and getting really hungry and wishing i could get something to eat and thats when the passage to hogs head opened up
556083 yeah well foods one of the five exceptions to gamps law of elemental transfiguration
556084 so weve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks
556085 and it just makes more hammocks every time we need room and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up
556086 thereve been so many rumors weve been trying to keep up with you on
556087 well theres something we ron hermione and i need to do and then well get out of here
556088 why cant you tell us its something to do with fighting you know who right
556089 we we cant tell you weve got to do it alone
556090 and we werent supposed to tell i mean he wanted us to do it just the three of us
556091 i never said it had but i dont see why you cant trust us everyone in this rooms been fighting and theyve been driven in here because the carrows were hunting them down everyone in heres proven theyre loyal to dumbledore loyal to you
556092 we got your message neville hello you three i thought you must be here
556093 i promised her and ginny that if you turned up id let them know we all thought that if you came back it would mean revolution that we were going to overthrow snape and the carrows
556094 isnt it harry were going to fight them out of hogwarts
556095 im sorry but thats not what we came back for
556096 what were doing will benefit everyone in the end its all about trying to get rid of you know who
556097 he wants a kip and his bars turned into a railway station
556098 just going to make it up as we go along are we my favorite kind
556099 the message said harry was back and we were going to fight
556100 we dont know where it is weve got to find it fast we dont have to tell them its a horcrux
556101 i think rons right we dont even know what were looking for we need them
556102 something something thatll help us overthrow you know who its here at hogwarts but we dont know where it might have belonged to ravenclaw has anyone heard of an object like that has anyone come across something with her eagle on it for instance
556103 well theres her lost diadem i told you about it remember harry the lost diadem of ravenclaw daddys trying to duplicate it
556104 professor flitwick says the diadem vanished with ravenclaw herself people have looked but
556105 ravenclaws was supposed to have magical properties enhance the wisdom of the wearer
556106 and none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it
556107 if youd like to see what the diadems supposed to look like i could take you up to our common room and show you harry ravenclaws wearing it in her statue
556108 listen i know its not much of a lead but im going to go look at this statue at least find out what the diadem looks like wait for me here and keep you know the other one safe
556109 he led harry and luna to a corner where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase
556110 it comes out somewhere different every day so theyve never been able to find it
556111 only trouble is we never know exactly where were going to end up when we go out be careful harry theyre always patrolling the corridors at night
556112 well you have to wait for somebody who gets it right
556113 yeah trouble is we cant really afford to wait for anyone else luna
556114 well then i think the answer is that a circle has no beginning
556115 ive never stunned anyone except in our d a lessons
556116 luna where are you i need to get under the cloak
556117 alecto the ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves terrified then without warning there came a series of loud bangs as though somebody was firing a gun into the door if he comes and we havent got potter dyou want to go the same way as the malfoys answer me
556118 go and get flitwick get him to open it now
556119 didnt professor flitwick let her in earlier this evening at your urgent request perhaps she could open the door for you then you neednt wake up half the castle
556120 ill cruciate the lot of em till they tell me who did it and whats the dark lord going to say
556121 we havent got him and theyve gone and killed her
556122 not after the dark lord gets hold of her shes gone and sent for him i felt me mark burn and he thinks weve got potter
556123 he told us potter might try and get inside ravenclaw tower and to send for him if we caught him
556124 why would harry potter try to get inside ravenclaw tower potter belongs in my house
556125 yeah thats what well do well say alecto was ambushed by the kids them kids up there
556126 and well say they forced her to pres her mark and thats why he got a false alarm he can punish them couple of kids more or less whats the difference
556127 only the difference between truth and lied courage and cowardice
556128 a difference in short which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate but let me make one thing very clear you are not going to pass off y9our many ineptitudes on the students of hogwarts i shall not permit it
556129 i dont think it makes any difference what we call him
556130 theres something i need to do professor so you know where the diadem of ravenclaw is
556131 the d diadem of ravenclaw of course not hasnt it been lost for centuries
556132 potter it was madness utter madness for you to enter this castle
556133 professor theres something hidden here that im supposed to find and it
556134 if he who must not be named does indeed know that you are here
556135 times running out voldemorts getting nearer professor im acting on dumbledores orders i must find what he wanted me to find but weve got to get the students out while im searching the castle its me voldemort wants but he wont care
556136 we shall secure the school against he who must not be named while you search for this this object
556137 and if hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege with the dark lord at the gates it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible
556138 i know professor but if voldemort and the death eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they wont be interested in anyone whos disapparating out of hogs head
556139 come we must alert the other heads of house youd better put that cloak back on
556140 you death eaters have your own private means of communication i forgot
556141 i did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors minerva
556142 i wonder what could have brought you out of our bed at this late hour
556143 unlike dumbledore he was still carrying a wand and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master
556144 my dear boy what a surprise minerva do please explain severus what
556145 very well he who must not be named is coming
556146 potter has work to do in the castle on dumbledores orders we need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while potter does what he needs to do
556147 you realize of course that nothing we do will be able to keep out you know who indefinitely
556148 i shall meet you in the great hall in twenty minutes with my house
556149 tentacula devils snare and snargaluff pods yes id like to see the death eaters fighting those
556150 professor im sorry to interrupt but this is important have you got any idea where the diadem of ravenclaw is
556151 a little extra wisdom never goes amiss potter but i hardly think it would be much use in
556152 we shall meet you and your ravenclaws in the great hall filius
556153 i shall expect you and the slytherins in the great hall in twenty minutes also
556154 if you wish to leave with your students we shall not stop you but if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle then horace we duel to kill
556155 the time has come for slytherin house to decide upon its loyalties
556156 man the boundaries protect us do your duty to our school
556157 you and miss lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the great hall i shall rouse the other gryffindors
556158 but harry did not look back and at last they reached the entrance to the room of requirement harry leaned against the enchanted wall which opened to admit them and he and luna sped back down the steep staircase
556159 voldemorts on his way theyre barricading he run for it what are you doing here how did you know
556160 you couldnt expect everyone to miss the fun harry and the d a let the order of the phoenix know and it all kind of snowballed
556161 theyre evacuating the younger kids and everyones meeting in the great hall to get organized
556162 i wont permit it the boys yes but you youve got to go home
556163 ginnys hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mothers grip
556164 a teenagers gang thats about to take him on which no one else has dared to do
556165 you cant do this everyone underage will have to leave its only right
556166 my whole familys here i cant stand waiting there alone and not knowing and
556167 i was an idiot i was a pompous prat i was a a
556168 but i had to find a way out and its not so easy at the ministry theyre imprisoning traitors all the time i managed to make contact with aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that hogwarts was going to make a fight of it so here i am
556169 well we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these
556170 now lets get upstairs and fight or all the good death eatersll be taken
556171 why doesnt ginny stay here then at least shell be on the scene and know whats going on but she wont be in the middle of the fighting
556172 evacuation will be overseen by mr filch and madame pomfrey prefects when i give the word you will organize your house and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation point
556173 the important thing is to get you out of here safely
556174 he has to use the common phrase done a bunk
556175 but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it
556176 your efforts are futile you cannot fight me i do not want to kill you i have great respect for the teachers of hogwarts i do not want to spill magical blood
556177 and they shall not be harmed give me harry potter and i shall leave the school untouched give me harry potter and you will be rewarded
556178 you will leave the hall first with mr filch if the rest of your house could follow
556179 weve only got half an half an hour until midnight so we need to act fast a battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of hogwarts and the order of the phoenix professors flitwick sprout and mcgonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers ravenclaw astronomy and gryffindor where theyll have good overview excellent positions from which to work spells meanwhile remus
556180 all right leaders up here and well divide up the troops
556181 nick youve got to help me whos the ghost of ravenclaw tower
556182 the gray lady of course but if it is ghostly services you require
556183 thats her over there harry the young woman with the long hair
556184 please i need some help i need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem
556185 if that diadems at hogwarts ive got to find it fast
556186 you are hardly the first student to covet the diadem
556187 its about voldemort defeating voldemort or arent you interested in that
556188 youre her daughter but then you must know what happed to it
556189 i doubt that it would greatly increase you chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself lord
556190 theres no time to explain but if you care about hogwarts if you want to see voldemort finished youve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem
556191 i sought to make myself cleverer more important than my mother i ran away with it
556192 my mother they say never admitted that the diadem was gone but pretended that she had it still she concealed her loss my dreadful betrayal even from the other founders of hogwarts
556193 then my mother fell ill fatally ill in spite of my perfidy she was desperate to see me one more time she sent a man who had long loved me though i spurned his advances to find me she knew that he would not rest until he had done so
556194 he tracked me to the forest where i was hiding when i refused to return with him he became violent the baron was always a hot tempered man furious at my refusal jealous of my freedom he stabbed me
556195 it remained where i had hidden it when i heard the baron blundering through the forest toward me concealed inside a hollow tree
556196 a forest in albania a lonely place i thought was far beyond my mothers reach
556197 youve already told someone this story havent you another student
556198 well you werent the first person riddle wormed things out of
556199 he hid the diadem in the castle the night he asked dumbledore to let him teach
556200 he mustve hidden the diadem on his way up to or down from dumbledores office but it was well worth trying to get the job then he mightve got the chance to nick gryffindors sword as well thank you thanks
556201 ill se yer in a moment theres a good lad
556202 voice carried didnt it yet got till midnight ter gimme potter knew yeh mus be here knew that mus be happenin get down fang so we come ter join in me an grawpy an fang smashed our way through the boundary by the forest grawpy was carryin us fang an me told him ter let me down at the castle so he shoved me through the window bless him not exactly what i meant bu wheres ron an hermione
556203 oh dont mind me ill just be here and crumble
556204 going to lob them over the walls they wont like this
556205 braggarts and rogues dogs and scoundrels drive them out harry potter see them off
556206 ive had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub potter
556207 im not deaf the whole of hogsmeade heard him and it never occurred to any of you to keep a few slytherins hostage there are kids of death eaters youve just sent to safety wouldnt it have been a bit smarter to keep em here
556208 wasnt it absolutely brilliant there we were after we left and i said to ron even if we find the other one how are we going to get rid of it we still hadnt got rid of the cup and then he thought of it the basilisk
556209 i had to have a few goes to get it right but
556210 hermione stabbed it thought she should she hasnt had the pleasure yet
556211 i know what the diadem looks like and i know where it is
556212 he hid it exactly where i had my old potions book where everyones been hiding stuff for centuries he thought he was the only one to find it come on
556213 are there still people in the passage to the hogs head
556214 i sealed it i think it unwise to leave it open now aberforth has left his pub have you seen my grandson
556215 i thought you were supposed to be with teddy at your mothers
556216 he was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds
556217 im sorry but we need you to leave too just for a bit then you can come back in
556218 the house elves theyll all be down in the kitchen wont they
556219 dyou think you could just just hold it in until weve got the diadem
556220 they look like they might be breaching the north battlements theyve brought giants of their own
556221 ginny well be back in a moment just keep out of the way keep safe come on
556222 too bad for him ive had to hide stuff in my time this way
556223 we ung back potter we decided not to go decided to bring you to im
556224 i virtually lived in the room of hidden things all last year
556225 you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die dum whats a die dum
556226 if you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing
556227 its potter the dark lord wants who cares about a die dum
556228 who cares what you think i dont take your orders no more draco you an your dad are finished
556229 but if i can i will the dark lord wants him dead anyway whats the diff
556230 again ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light the wand less malfoy cowered behind a three legged wardrobe as hermione charged toward them hitting goyle with a stunning spell as she came
556231 harry bawled but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air
556232 what are you doing what are you doing the doors that way
556233 screamed malfoy but harry made a hairpin swerve and dived the diadem seemed to fall in slow motion turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent and then he had it caught it around his wrist
556234 she was here she was supposed to be going back into the room of requirement
556235 lets stick together i say we go harry whats that on your arm
556236 fiendfyre cursed fire its one of the substances that destroy horcruxes but i would never ever have dared use it its so dangerous how did crabbe know how to
556237 shame he wasnt concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it really
556238 if he hadnt tried to kill us all id be quite sorry he was dead
556239 ron were the only ones who can end it please ron we need the snake weve got to kill the snake
556240 well have to to reach the snake but lets not lose sight now of what were supposed to be d doing were the only ones who can end it
556241 you need to find out where voldemort is because hell have the snake with him wont he do it harry look inside him
556242 if your son is dead lucius it is not my fault he did not come and join me like the rest of the slytherins perhaps he has decided to befriend harry potter
556243 you afraid my lord that potter might die at another hand but yours
556244 wouldnt it be forgive me more prudent to call off this battle enter the castle and seek him y yourself
556245 do not pretend lucius you wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son and i do not need to seek potter before the night is out potter will have come to find me
556246 snape now i need him there is a service i require from him go
556247 hes in the shrieking shack the snakes with him its got some sort of magical protection around it hes just sent lucius malfoy to find snape
556248 he knows im after keeping nagini close beside him obviously im going to have to go to him to get near the thing
556249 so you cant go thats what he wants what hes expecting
556250 you two stay here ill go under the cloak and ill be back as soon as i
556251 it makes much more sense if i take the cloak
556252 and thats the second time weve saved your life tonight you two faced bastard
556253 i can see the palce if we jsut had crookshanks again
556254 skilled wizard though you are severus i do not think you will make much difference now we are almost there almost
556255 let me find the boy let me bring you potter i know i can find him my lord please
556256 i do not understand you you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand
556257 i have performed my usual magic i am extraordinary but this wand no it has not revealed the wonders it has promised i feel no difference between this wand and the one i procured from ollivander all those years ago
556258 i have thought long and hard severus do you know why i have called you back from battle
556259 no my lord but i beg you will let me return let me find potter
556260 you sound like lucius neither of you understands potter as i do he does not need finding potter will come to me i knew his weakness you see his one great flaw he will hate watching the others struck down around him knwoing that it is for him that it happens he will want to stop it at any cost he will come
556261 but my lord he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourself
556262 my instructions to the death eaters have been perfectly clear
556263 but it is of you that i wished to speak severus not harry potter you have been very valuable to me very valuable
556264 my concern at the moment severus is what will happen when i finally meet the boy
556265 why did both the wands i have used fail when directed at harry potter
556266 my wand of yew did everything of which i asked it severus except to kill harry potter twice it failed ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores told me to take anothers wand i did so but luciuss wand shattered upon meeting potters
556267 i sought a third wand severus the elder wand the wand of destiny the deathstick i took it from its previous master i took it from the grfave of albus dumbledore
556268 all this long night when i am on the brink of victory i have sat here
556269 wondering wondering why the elder wand refuses to be what it ought to be refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner and i think i have the answer
556270 perhaps you already know it you are a clever man after all severus you have been a good and faithful servant and i regret what must happen
556271 the elder wand cannot serve me properly severus because i am not its true master the elder wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner you killed albus dumbledore while you live severus the elder wand cannot truly be mine
556272 i must master the wand severus master the wand and i master potter at last
556273 yet you have sustained heavy losses if you continue to resist me you will all die one by one i do not wish this to happen every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste
556274 lord voldemort is merciful i command my forces to retreat immediately
556275 you have one hour dispose of your dead with dignity treat your injured
556276 i speak now harry potter directly to you you have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself i shall wait for one hour in the forbidden forest if at the end of that hour you have not come to me have not given yourself up then battle recommences this time i shall enter the fray myself harry potter and i shall find you and i shall punish every last man woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me one hour
556277 lets lets get back to the castle if hes gone to the forest well need to think of a new plan
556278 are youre that snape boy they live down spinners end by the river
556279 and the ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school you get letters
556280 were all right we havent got wands yet they let you off when youre a kid and you cant help it but once youre eleven
556281 and they start training you then youve got to go careful
556282 not for her but well get the letter you and me
556283 but youre muggle born so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents
556284 but it wont be that long and ill be gone
556285 she caught her sisters hand and held tight to it even though petunia tried to pull it away
556286 maybe once im there no listen tuney maybe once im there ill be able to go to professor dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind
556287 you think i want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a a
556288 a special school for freaks you and that snape boy weirdos thats what you two are its good youre being separated from normal people its for our safety
556289 you didnt think it was such a freaks school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you
556290 that boy found it you and that boy have been sneaking in my room
556291 severus saw the envelope and he couldnt believe a muggle could have contacted hogwarts thats all
556292 she spat at her sister and she flounced off to where her parents stood
556293 tuney h hates me because we saw that letter from dumbledore
556294 who wants to be in slytherin i think id leave wouldnt you
556295 maybe ill break the tradition where are you heading if youve got the choice
556296 gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart like my dad
556297 it was dark magic and if you think thats funny
556298 what about the stuff potter and his mates get up to
556299 they sneak out at night theres something weird about that lupin where does he keep going
556300 why are you so obsessed with them anyway why do you care what theyre doing at night
556301 im just trying to show you theyre not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are
556302 i didnt m ean i just dont want to see you made a fool of he fancies you james potter fancies you
556303 i dont need you to tell me that but mulcibers and averys idea of humor is just evil sev i dont understand how you can be friends with them
556304 i only came out because mary told me you were threatening to sleep here
556305 its too late ive made excuses for you for years none of my friends can understand why i even talk to you you and your precious little death eater friends you see you dont even deny it you dont even deny thats what youre all aiming to be you cant wait to join you know who can you
556306 i cant pretend anymore youve chosen your way ive chosen mine
556307 to call me mudblood but you call everyone of my birth mudblood severus why should i be any different
556308 well severus what message does lord voldemort have for me
556309 i i come with a warning no a request please
556310 that is why it is for that reason he thinks it means lily evans
556311 it spoke of a boy born at the end of july
556312 surely lord voldemort will spare her could you not ask for mercy for the mother in exchange for the son
556313 you do not care then about the deaths of her husband and child they can die as long as you have what you want
556314 she and james put their faith in the wrong person
556315 rather like you severus werent you hoping that lord voldemort would spare her
556316 her son lives he has her eyes precisely her eyes you remember the shape and color of lily evanss eyes i am sure
556317 if you loved lily evans if you truly loved her then your way forward is clear
556318 you know how and why she died make sure it was not in vain help me protect lilys son
556319 the dark lord will return and harry potter will be in terrible danger when he does
556320 very well very well but never never tell dumbledore this must be between us swear it i cannot bear especially potters son i want your word
556321 my word severus that i shall never reveal the best of you
556322 mediocre arrogant as his father a determined rule breaker delighted to find himself famous attention seeking and impertinent
556323 other teachers report that the boy is modest likable and reasonably talented personally i find him an engaging child
556324 karkaroffs mark is becoming darker too he is panicking he fears retribution you know how much help he gave the ministry after the dark lord fell
556325 you are a braver man by far than igor karkaroff
556326 that ring carried a curse of extraordinary power to contain it is all we can hope for i have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being
556327 you have done very well severus how long do you think i have
556328 i cannot tell maybe a year there is no halting such a spell forever it will spread eventually it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time
556329 i am fortunate extremely fortunate that i have you severus
556330 if you had only summoned me a little earlier i might have been able to do more buy you more time
556331 did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse
556332 i refer to the plan lord voldemort is revolving around me his plan to have the poor malfoy boy murder me
556333 the dark lord does not expect draco to succeed this is merely punishment for luciuss recent failures slow torture for dracos parents while they watch him fail and pay the price
556334 in short the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as i have
556335 now i should have thought the natural successor to the job once draco fails is yourself
556336 lord voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at hogwarts
556337 he believes the school will soon be in his grasp yes
556338 i have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at hogwarts
556339 much less since his father has lost favor draco blames me he thinks i have usurped luciuss position
556340 all the same try i am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy ultimately of course there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from lord voldemorts wrath
556341 or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph
556342 i daresay the moment will present itself in due course given what has happened tonight
556343 we can be sure that it will happen within a year
556344 i would not have it ripped apart on my account
556345 you alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation
556346 i ask this one great favor of you severus because death is coming for me as surely as the chudley cannons will finish bottom of this years league i confess i should prefer a quick painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if for instance greyback is involved i hear voldemort has recruited him or dear bellatrix who likes to play with her food before she eats it
556347 what are you doing with potter all these evenings you are closeted together
556348 why you arent trying to give him detentions severus the boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out
556349 in looks perhaps but his deepest nature is much more like his mothers i spend time with harry because i have things to discuss with him information i must give him before it is too late
556350 it is not a question of trust i have as we both know limited time it is essential that i give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do
556351 i prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of lord voldemort
556352 and you do it extremely well do not think that i underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself severus to give voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job i would entrust to nobody but you
556353 yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of occlumency whose magic is mediocre and who has a direct connection into the dark lords mind
556354 not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing harrys mind means to him it was pain such as he has never experienced he will not try to possess harry again i am sure of it not in that way
556355 lord voldemorts soul maimed as it is cannot bear close contact with a soul like harrys
556356 in the case of harry and lord voldemort to speak of one is to speak of the other
556357 you refuse to tell me everything yet you expect that small service of me
556358 you take a great deal for granted dumbledore perhaps i have changed my mind
556359 you gave me your word severus and while we are talking about services you owe me i thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young slytherin friend
556360 come to my office tonight severus at eleven and you shall not complain that i have no confidence in you
556361 harry must not know not until the last moment not until it is necessary otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done
556362 that is between harry and me now listen closely severus there will come a time after my death do not argue do not interrupt there will come a time when lord voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake
556363 precisely if there comes a time when lord voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection then i think it will be safe to tell harry
556364 tell him that on the night lord voldemort tried to kill him when lily cast her own life between them as a shield the killing curse rebounded upon lord voldemort and a fragment of voldemorts soul was blasted apart from the whole and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building part of lord voldemort lives inside harry and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes and a connection with lord voldemorts mind that he has never understood and while that fragment of soul unmissed by voldemort remains attached to and protected by harry lord voldemort cannot die
556365 and voldemort himself must do it severus that is essential
556366 i thought all those years that we were protecting him for her for lily
556367 we have protected him because it has been essential to teach him to raise him to let him try his strength
556368 meanwhile the connection between them grows ever stronger a parasitic growth sometimes i have thought he suspects it himself if i know him he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death it will truly mean the end of voldemort
556369 you have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment
556370 dont be shocked severus how many men and women have you watched die
556371 i have spied for you and lied for you put myself in mortal danger for you
556372 you will have to give voldemort the correct date of harrys departure from his aunt and uncles
556373 not to do so will raise suspicion when voldemort believes you so well informed
556374 that they use decoys polyjuice potion identical potters its the only thing that might work you will forget that i have suggested this you will present it as your own idea you understand
556375 the granger girl then mentioned the place as she opened her bag and i heard her
556376 and you still arent going to tell me why its so important to give potter the sword
556377 course not this is something else but i might be out of sight for a while you know voldemorts snake neville hes got a huge snake calls it nagini
556378 just in case theyre busy and you get the chance
556379 were all going to keep fighting harry you know that
556380 and he will want it to be quick he wants it over
556381 sorry i will never know him but he will know why i died and i hope he will understand i was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life
556382 that head case hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here
556383 times nearly up porters had his hour hes not coming
556384 you wonderful boy you brave brave man let us walk
556385 that is the question isnt it on the whole dear boy i think not
556386 but i should have died i didnt defend myself i meant to let him kill me
556387 so the part of his soul that was in me
556388 yes he destroyed it your soul is whole and completely your own harry
556389 and nobody died for me this time how can i be alive
556390 think back remember what he did in his ignorance in his greed and his cruelty
556391 he took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it your blood in his veins harry lilys protection inside both of you he thethered you to life while he lives
556392 i live while he lives but i thought i thought it was the other way around i thought we both had to die or is it the same thing
556393 you were the seventh horcrux harry the horcrux he never meant to make
556394 and his knowledge remained woefully incomplete harry that which voldemort does not value he takes no trouble to comprehend of house elves and childrens tales of love loyalty and innocence voldemort knows and understands nothing
556395 he took your blood believing it would strengthen him he took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you his body keeps her sacrafice alive and while that enchantment survives so do you and so does voldemorts one last hope for himself
556396 theres more to it why did my wand break the wand he borrowed
556397 what you must understand harry is that you and lord voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested but here is what
556398 without meaning to as you now know lord voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form
556399 having ensured this two fold connection having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours
556400 he was more afraid than you were that night harry
556401 i believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of voldemorts wand that night which is to say that it contained a little of voldemort himself so your wand recognized him when he pursued you recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him magic much more powerful than anything luciuss wand had ever performed your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of voldemorts own deadly skill what chance did that poor stick of lucius malfoys stand
556402 but if my wand was so powerful how come hermione was able to break it
556403 my dear boy its remarkable effects were directed only at voldemort who had tampered so ill advisedly with the deepest laws of magic only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful otherwise it was a wand like any other though a good one i am sure
556404 i think we can agree that you are not dead though of course
556405 i do not minimize your sufferings which i am sure were severe
556406 like kings cross station except a lo cleaner and empty and there are no trains as far as i can see
556407 my dear boy i have no idea this is as they say
556408 can you forgive me for not trusting you for not telling you harry i only feared that you would fail as i had failed i only dreaded that you would make my mistakes i crave your pardon harry i have known for some time now that you are the better man
556409 and i was such a fool but you know dont you i have no secrets from you anymore you know
556410 master of death harry master of death was i better ultimately than voldemort
556411 of course how can you ask that you never killed if you could avoid it
556412 yet i too sought a way to conquer death harry
556413 it was the thing above all that drew us together
556414 two clever arrogant boys with a shared obsession he wanted to come to godrics hollow as i am sure you have guessed because of the grave of ignotus peverell he wanted to explore the place the third brother had died
556415 oh yes i think so whether they met death on a lonely road i think it more likely that the
556416 the cloak as you know now traveled down through the ages father to son mother to daughter right down to ignotuss last living descendant who was born as ignotus was in the village of godrics hollow
556417 you you have guessed i know why the cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died james had showed it to me just a few days previously it explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school i could hardly believe what i was seeing i asked to borrow it to examine it i had long since given up my dream of uniting the hallows but i could not resist could not help taking a closer look it was a cloak the likes of which i had never seen immensely old perfect in every respect and then your father died and i had two hallows at last all to myself
556418 voldemort knew where my mum and dad were the cloak couldnt have made them curse proof
556419 so youd given up looking for the hallows when you saw the cloak
556420 you know what happened you know you cannot despise me more than i despise myself
556421 you know the secret of my sisters ill health what those muggles did what she became
556422 i was gifted i was brilliant i wanted to escape i wanted to shine i wanted glory
556423 i loved them i loved my parents i loved my brother and my sister but i was selfish harry more selfish than you who are a remarkably selfless person could possibly imagine
556424 so that when my mother died and i was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother i returned to my village in anger and bitterness trapped and wasted i thought and then of course he came
556425 grindelwald you cannot imagine how his ideas caught me harry inflamed me muggles forced into subservience we wizards triumphant grindelwald and i the glorious young leaders of the revolution
556426 and at the heart of our schemes the deathly hallows
556427 invincible masters of death grindelwald and dumbledore two months of insanity of cruel dreams and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me
556428 and then you know what happened reality returned in the form of my rough unlettered and infinitely more admirable brother i did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me i did not want to hear that i could not set forth and seek hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow
556429 the argument became a fight grindelwald lost control that which i had always sensed in him though i pretended not to now sprang into terrible being and ariana after all my mothers care and caution lay dead upon the floor
556430 well grindelwald fled as anyone but i could have predicted
556431 years passed there were rumors about him they said he had procured a wand of immense power i meanwhile was offered the post of minister of magic not once but several times naturally i refused i had learned that i was not to be trusted with power
556432 but youd have been better much better than fudge or scimgeour
556433 you are very kind harry but while i busied myself with the training of young wizards grindelwald was raising an army they say he feared me and perhaps he did but less i think than i feared him
556434 i think he knew it i think he knew what frightened me i delayed meeting him until finally it would have been too shameful to resist any longer people were dying and he seemed unstoppable and i had to do what i could
556435 well you know what happened next i won the duel i won the wand
556436 grindelwald tried to stop voldemort going after the wand he lied you know pretended he had never had it
556437 they say he showed remorse in later years alone in his cell at nurmengard i hope that is true i would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done perhaps that lie to voldemort was his attempt to make amends to prevent voldemort from taking the hallow
556438 when i discovered it after all those years buried in the abandoned home of the gaunts the hallow i had craved most of all though in my youth i had wanted it for very different reasons i lost my head harry
556439 i was such a fool harry after all those years i had learned nothing i was unworthy to unite the deathly hallows i had proved it time and again and here was final proof
556440 it was natural you wanted to see them again whats wrong with that
556441 maybe a man in a million could unite the hallows harry i was fit only to possess the meanest of them the least extraordinary i was fit to own the elder wand
556442 but the cloak i took out of vain curiousity and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you its true owners the stone i would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace rather than enable my self sacrafice as you did you are the worthy possessor of the hallows
556443 i am afraid i counted on miss granger to slow you up harry i was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart i was scared that if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects you might seize the hallows as i did at the wrong time for the wrong reasons if you laid hands on them i wanted you to possess them safely you are the true master of death because the true master does not seek to run away from death he accepts that he must die and understands that there are far far worse things in the living world than dying
556444 i do not think so because he did not recognize the resurrection stone he turned into a horcrux but even if he had known about them harry i doubt that he woul dhave been interested in any except the first he would not think that he needed the cloak and as for the stone whom would he want to bring back from the dead he fears the dead he does not love
556445 i have been sure that he would try ever since your wand beat voldemorts in the graveyard of little hangleton at first he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill once he had kidnapped ollivander however he discovered the existence of the twin cores he thought that explained everything yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours so voldemort instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong what gift you possessed that he did not naturally set out to find the one wand that they said would beat any other for him the elder wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you he believes that the elder wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible poor severus
556446 if you planned your death with snape you meant him to end up with the elder wand didnt you
556447 but it did not work as i intended did it
556448 we are in kings cross you say i think that if you decided not to go back you would be able to lets say board a train
556449 that if you choose to return there is a chance that he may be finished for good i cannot promise it but i know this harry that you have less to fear from returning here than he does
556450 do not pity the dead harry pity the living and above all those who live without love by returning you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed fewer families are torn apart if that seems to you a worthy goal they we saw good bye for the present
556451 is this real or has this been happening inside my head
556452 of course it is happening inside your head harry but why on earth should that mean it is not real
556453 harry potter is dead by my hand and no man alive can threaten me now
556454 we go to the castle and show them what has become of their hero
556455 he will be nice and visible in your arms will he not pick up your little friend hagrid and the
556456 happy now are yeh that yeh didnt fight yeh cowardly bunch o nags are yeh happy harry potters d dead
556457 harry potter is dead he was killed as he ran away trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him we bring you his
556458 the battle is won you have lost half of your fighters my death eaters outnumber you and the boy who lived is finished there must be no more war anyone who continues to resist man woman or child will be slaughtered as will every member of their family come out of the castle now kneel before me and you shall be spared your parents and children your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven and you will join me in the new world we shall build togheter
556459 it is over set him down hagrid at my feet where he belongs
556460 harry potter is dead do you understand now deluded ones he was nothing ever but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him
556461 he was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds
556462 who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost
556463 it is neville longbottom my lord the boy who has been giving the carrows so much trouble the son of the aurors remember
556464 but you are a pureblood arent you my brave boy voldemort asked neville who stood facing him
556465 you show spirit and bravery and you come of noble stock you will make a very valuable death eater we need your kind neville longbottom
556466 if that is your choice longbottom we revert to the original plan on your head
556467 there will be no more houses the emblem sheild and colors of my noble ancestor salazar slythering will suffice everyone wont they neville longbottom
556468 neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me
556469 fight fight fight for my master defender of house elves fight the dark lord in the name of brave regulus fight
556470 what will happen to your children when ive killed you
556471 roared harry and the shield charm expanded in the middle of the hall and voldemort stared around for the source as harry pulled off the invisibility cloak at last
556472 its got to be like this its got to be me
556473 this isnt how he works is it who are you going to use as a shield today potter
556474 there are no more horcruxes its just you and me neither can live while the other survives and one of us is about to leave for good
556475 you think it will be you do you the boy who has survived by accident and because dumbledore was pulling the strings
556476 accident was it when my mother died to save me
556477 accident when i decided to fight in that graveyard accident that i didnt defend myself tonight and still survived and returned to fight again
556478 screamed voldemort but still he did not strike and the watching crowd was frozen as if petrified and of the hundreds in the hall nobody seemed to breathe but they two
556479 accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women and permitted me to kill them for you
556480 you wont be able to kill any of them ever again
556481 i meant to and thats what did it ive done what my mother did theyre protected from you havent you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding you cant torture them you cant touch them you dont learn from your mistakes riddle do you
556482 i know things you dont know tom riddle i know lots of important things that you dont want to hear some before you make another big mistake
556483 dumbledore favorite solution which he claimed conqered death though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like and old waxwork which did not prevent me stamping out your modblood mother like a cockroack potter and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse so what will stop you dying now when i strike
556484 if it is not love that will save you this time
556485 you must believe that you have magic that i do not or else a weapon more powerful than mine
556486 but he knew more than you knew enough not to do what youve done
556487 too weak to dare too weak to take what might have been his what will be mine
556488 voldemort hurled the words at harry as in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle i have seen it potter and he will not return
556489 but you didnt have him killed he chose his own manner of dying chose it months before he died arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant
556490 snape was dumbledores dumbledores from the moment you starting hunting down my mother and you never realized it because of the thing you cant understand you never saw snape cast a patronus did you riddle
556491 the same as my mothers because he loved her for nearly all of his life from the time when they were children you should have realized
556492 but when she had gone he agreed that there were other women and of purer blood worhier of him
556493 but he was dumbledores spy from the moment you threatened her and hes been working against you ever since dumbledore was already dying when snape finished him
556494 it matters not whether snape was mine or dumbledores or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path i crushed them as i crushed your mother snapes supposed great
556495 dumbledore was trying to keep the elder wand from me he intended that snape should be the true master of the wand but i got there ahead of you little boy i reached the wand before you could get your hands on it i understood the truth before you caught up i killed severus snape three hours ago and the elder wand the deathstick the wand of destiny is truly mine dumbledores last plan went wrong harry potter
556496 youre right but before you try to kill me id advise you think what youve done think and try for some remorse riddle
556497 its all youve got left ive seen what youll be otherwise be a man try try for some remorse
556498 because dumbledores last plan hasnt backfired on me at all its backfired on you riddle
556499 that wand still isnt working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person severus snape was never the true master of the elder wand he never defeated dumbledore
556500 arent you listening dumbledores death was planned between them dumbledore instended to die undefeated the wands last true master if all had gone as planned the wands power would have died with him because it had never been won from him
556501 but then potter dumbledore as good as gave me the wand
556502 i stole the wand from its last masters tomb i removed it against the last masters wishes its power is mine
556503 you still dont get it riddle do you possessing the wand isnt enough holding it using it doesnt make it really yours didnt you listen to ollivander the elder wand recognized a new master before dumbledore died someone who never even laid a hand on it the new master removed the wand from dumbledore against his will never realizing exactly what he had done or that the worlds most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance
556504 the true master of the elder wand was draco malfoy
556505 even if you are right potter it makes no difference to you and me you no longer have the phoenix wand we duel on skill alone and after i have killed you i can attend to draco malfoy
556506 youve missed your chance i got there first i overpowered draco weeks ago i took his wand from him
556507 does the wand in your hand know its last master was disarmed because if it does i am the true master of the elder wand
556508 id want some peace and quiet if it were me
556509 really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing doesnt it
556510 and let it be noted that slytherin house played its part let our contribution not be forgotten
556511 i dropped it in the forest i dont exactly here but im not going to go looking for it again do you agree
556512 a wise and courageous decision but no less than i would have expected of you does anyone know else know where it fell
556513 but of course harry it is yours forever until you pass it on
556514 back where it came from it can stay there if i die a natural death like ignotus its power will be broken wont it the previous master will never have been defeated thatll be the end of it
556515 theres nothing wrong with that he might be in slytherin
556516 james says most people only get letters from home about once a month
556517 we wrote to james three times a week last year
556518 and you dont want to believe everything he tells you about hogwarts
556519 i did hermione didnt believe i could pass a muggle driving test did you she thought id have to confound the examiner
556520 i only forgot to look in the wing mirror and lets face it i can use a supersensory charm for that
556521 make sure you beat him in every test rosie thank god you inherited your mothers brains
556522 dont try to turn them against each other before theyve even started school
556523 dont get too friendly with him though rosie granddad weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood
556524 just seen him and guess what hes doing snogging victoire
556525 and he said hed come to see her off and then he told me to go away hes snogging her
556526 he already comes round for dinner about four times a week
556527 why dont we just invite him to live with is and have done with it
556528 i dont mind sharing with al teddy could have my room
556529 you and al will share a room only when i want the house demolished
556530 outside yeah but at school hes professor longbottom isnt he i cant walk into herbology and give him love
556531 i thought they were invisible you said they were invisible
556532 theyre gentle things theres nothing scare about them anyway you wont be going up to school in the carriages youll be going in the boats
556533 dont forget hagrids invited you to tea next friday dont mess with peeves dont duel anyone till youre learned how and dont let james wind you up
556534 you were named for two headmasters of hogwarts one of them was a slytherin and he was probably the bravest man i ever knew
556535 then slytherin house will have gained an excellent student wont it it doesnt matter to us al but if it matter to you youll be able to choose gryffindor over slytherin the sorting hat takes your choice into account
556536 this sort of outbreak is a very difficult thing to manage

556559 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognised clinical nomenclature is not being used
556560 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments
556561 the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women
556562 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help
556563 they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm

556565 for all gordon browns talk of creating a fair society with opportunity for all the reality is very different
556566 a child from a deprived background is 193 times more likely to leave school without a single good gcse than they are to get three as at a level
556567 this level of inequality is a national disgrace and a block on opportunity reforming our schools and strengthening our families is the key to building a better happier and fairer society

556572 it didnt seem like she was telling me to go away if shed told me to leave id have done so straight away

556580 while we do not have a sort of webwatcher in this country who can scour the web for these types of offences it is illegal to publish this type of material and anyone who takes it upon themselves to do so faces the risk of prosecution we encourage people to report any incidents where racial or religious hatred is incited regardless of what medium it is found in
556581 would be far better to be able to do it before the next federal election
556582 im not going to give gratuitous advice to my federal colleagues but brendan nelson is on the record as saying that he supports a merger at a national level
556583 i think it can be used as a template and i think that following on from the discussions that we are having nationally it can be achieved in the short to medium term
556584 now people obviously they have some concerns with a mixture of egos and all those sorts of things

556591 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
556592 we simply wrote to qantas asking for a briefing after all the investigations are done its being portrayed that somehow were demanding meetings
556593 if you were qantas now youd be seeing the faa as being engaged in some sort of public attack on them and were not
556594 qantas is a safe airline it remains a safe airline and all were saying is obviously there was an incident which was serious and could have been much worse and you would expect us to want to sit down with them
556595 were flight attendants we have to fly in the aircraft its just a natural request
556596 for the first time since returning to democracy in 1983 the institutions were able to seriously discuss a law that for the first time relates to the redistribution of income
556597 the number of retail outlets selling ethanol blend has increased three fold over the past two years concentrating in queensland and new south wales and to a lesser extent in south australia and victoria
556598 price would be a contributor but i think people are interested in being more environmental about their fuels and also promoting an alternative source of fuel
556599 weve dominated this race twice now and not closed the deal
556600 if i did speed in pit lane i just couldnt see a thing there so when i saw the flashing lights at the end of pit lane i just went
556601 im aware that he saw the footage on tv last night and chose to attend mt druitt police station
556602 the victims were courageous in first surviving the incidents and then reporting the incidents to police and secondly having the nous to contact police again once they sighted the offender
556603 its been a traumatic experience for all the victims and im confident in saying theyve been receiving valuable help from their friends and family counsellors and police
556604 i made a decision not to politicise the games this is for athletics
556605 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
556606 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
556607 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
556608 it was a safety factor we wanted to make sure that he was outside and to apprehend him outside away from his child
556609 her first words were that she was very happy to see nice people she was pleased with that and she was ecstatic about that

556615 an incompetent or unscrupulous intelligence agency can be as great a threat to national security as not having one at all
556616 our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime
556617 or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii and korea we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
556618 government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
556619 the expansion of private i e mainly corporate power and the selective abdication of governmental responsibility for the well being of the citizenry
556620 the privatization of public services and functions manifests the steady evolution of corporate power into a political form into an integral even dominant partner with the state it marks the transformation of american politics and its political culture from a system in which democratic practices and values were if not defining at least major contributory elements to one where the remaining democratic elements of the state and its populist programs are being systematically dismantled
556621 in 2006 the cost of americas spying and surveillance activities outsourced to contractors reached 42 billion or about 70 percent of the estimated 60 billion the government spends each year on foreign and domestic intelligence the number of contract employees now exceeds the cias full time workforce of 17 500 contractors make up more than half the workforce of the cias national clandestine service formerly the directorate of operations which conducts covert operations and recruits spies abroad
556622 if theres one generalization to be made about the nsas outsourced it information technology programs it is this they havent worked very well and some have been spectacular failures in 2006 the nsa was unable to analyze much of the information it was collecting as a result more than 90 percent of the information it was gathering was being discarded without being translated into a coherent and understandable format only about 5 percent was translated from its digital form into text and then routed to the right division for analysis
556623 the key phrase in the new counterterrorism lexicon is public private partnerships in reality partnerships are a convenient cover for the perpetuation of corporate interests
556624 the separate bookkeeping and accountability devised for blackwater dyncorp triple canopy and similar outfits was part of a careful displacement of oversight from congress to the vice president and the stewards of his policies in various departments and agencies to have much of the work parceled out to private companies who are unaccountable to army rules or military justice meant among its other advantages that the cost of the war could be concealed beyond all detection
556625 bill clinton picked up the cudgel where the conservative ronald reagan left off and took it deep into services once considered inherently governmental including high risk military operations and intelligence functions once reserved only for government agencies by the end of clintons first term more than 100 000 pentagon jobs had been transferred to companies in the private sector among them thousands of jobs in intelligence by the end of his second term in 2001 the administration had cut 360 000 jobs from the federal payroll and the government was spending 44 percent more on contractors than it had in 1993
556626 outsourcing as a virtual joint venture between house majority leader newt gingrich and clinton
556627 boldest privatization agenda put forth by any president to date
556628 a neoconservative drive to siphon u s spending on defense national security and social programs to large corporations friendly to the bush administration
556629 every purchase you make with a credit card every magazine subscription you buy and medical prescription you fill every web site you visit and every e mail you send or receive every bank deposit you make every trip you book and every event you attend all these transactions and communications will go into what the defense department describes as a virtual centralized grand database
556630 so many former intelligence officers joined the private sector during the 1990s that by the turn of the century the institutional memory of the united states intelligence community now resides in the private sector thats pretty much where things stood on september 11 2001

556650 every single utility would decrease the time they said it would be before solar would be a significant part of their utility mix
556651 in a country where solar radiation is sub par compared to many parts of the u s i have to hand it to the progressiveness and commitment germany made to solar
556652 in the upcoming months we should expect to hear more from pg amp e activities in this area
556653 half the utilities on the trip really had done nothing or little solar installation
556654 for the first time since returning to democracy in 1983 the institutions were able to seriously discuss a law that for the first time relates to the redistribution of income

556660 patents are often needed to provide an incentive for innovative work but in this case the academic work lacked inventiveness as other researchers had already shown the connection between surnames y chromosomes and family history this is a great outcome and allows dna heritage and other test companies to continue offering these tests and database services to the ever growing genetic genealogy community without having to raise prices due to royalty payments

556666 to do something that has a big budget a great scope with a great director and great actors that has the quality and level of writing and the level of production design is a once in a lifetime opportunity
556667 any actor in his right mind would want to do this film would die to do it
556668 thailand invited us in a great way we got the possibility to do this fantastic backdrop i couldnt dream of
556669 weve been able to rethink the film and maybe gain a little bit more production value
556670 i think the construction team has been able to achieve something we would have never been able to do in china
556671 everything exceeded our imagination all the movies set in shanghai in the future can shoot here
556672 we were going to follow in a lot of peoples footsteps so when we couldnt work there we suddenly in a way had a breath of fresh air we thought well we can build our own world
556673 china has a great film industry with a great history but it is hard place to integrate for a western film so we were trying to marry our system with their system and thats been a little bit easier in bangkok the systems here are a little bit more compatible
556674 the government at that moment not before or after felt it was risky for them to have another film in the same time period
556675 with greatest respect to the chinese people they chinese film officials felt that this was not the right time for them to get into this movie and we did not want to press them on it we feel theres a great future for ourselves as the producers and for the weinstein co in china so we respectfully took their decision at face value
556676 a film with gong li and with chow yun fat we really have to release it in china
556677 it is very disappointing to see the new cabinet list
556678 the new cabinet cannot give thais any hope in dealing with the economic situation
556679 police are investigating the incidents but so far we concluded the bombers wanted to threaten and cause trouble rather than kill anyone since they were small bombs
556680 serious irregularities and suspicious transactions in the administration of these charities were found

556694 we are experiencing the same crunch as other livestock farmers
556695 many of our farmers report 40 feed price increases over last year
556696 the birds are docile quiet easy to raise and they produce a number of marketable end products
556697 here in montana many emu farms have evolved into integrated farming operations they raise the birds arrange for processing and then have those raw products turned into end products which they sell
556698 aliens and entities owned controlled or dominated by aliens or foreign governments may not engage in operations involving the utilization of energy this restriction applies primarily to nuclear reactors and reprocessing plants extracting plutonium
556699 these notices are in place for a reason to protect victorians he said
556700 we dont take the decision to ban products lightly but once we have made that decision we will do all that we can to ensure unsafe products are not sold in victoria
556701 traders need to be aware if you sell banned products in victoria you will be caught and prosecuted he said
556702 the convention is geared for hispanic businesses and companies that want to reach out to the hispanic entrepreneur and community
556703 it has evolved into a convention for all folks to gather at one time to network train learn and share ideas about hispanic business
556704 this is one opportunity to meet people who have faced common obstacles and gotten past them it can be one of the most inspirational activities for a small business
556705 he epitomized the small business owner that utilized access points through procurement and matchmaking opportunities to grow his business
556706 it shows the state chambers strong relationship with big capital not only the governors office but the legislature
556707 one of the tenets of chamber business is to make sure that we as hispanic businesses are heard at the capital
556708 hispanic businesses still arent getting their share of the economic pie and we needed something in the state to work collaboratively in bringing hispanic businesses together
556709 if in some way those leaders in all of these chambers are able to see the results of their help it really does inspire and jazz them thats whats difference about the chcc were a network and its our strength
556710 id like to share a few products today to pretty up the office that to borrow the expression from my pal steven make my heart go boom boom boom

556712 then the king summoned all the leaders of judah and jerusalem and the king went up to the temple of the lord with all the people of judah and jerusalem and the priests and the levites all the people from the greatest to the least there the king read to them the entire book of the covenant that had been found in the lords temple
556713 god is able to make you strong just as the good news says it is the message about jesus christ and his plan for you gentiles a plan kept secret from the beginning of time but now as the prophets foretold and as the eternal god has commanded this message is made known to all gentiles everywhere so that they might believe and obey christ to god who alone is wise be the glory forever through jesus christ amen
556714 put me on trial lord and cross examine me test my motives and affections
556715 i love your sanctuary lord the place where your glory shines
556716 a gossip tells secrets so dont hang around with someone who talks too much
556717 if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all
556718 how long was it lost and or which king was the last to actively seek it out and use it
556719 now all glory to god who is able to make you strong just as my good news says this message about jesus christ has revealed his plan for you gentiles a plan kept secret from the beginning of time
556720 all glory to the only wise god through jesus christ forever amen
556721 be wise in what is good and simple concerning evil
556722 the god of peace will crush satan under our feet shortly
556723 the doctrine of a risen saviour is exceedingly precious the resurrection is the corner stone of the entire building of christianity
556724 the doctrine is the basis of the experience but as the flower is more lovely than the root so is the experience of fellowship with the risen saviour more lovely than the doctrine itself
556725 though you cannot like the disciples see him visibly yet i bid you aspire to see christ jesus by the eye of faith and though like mary magdalene you may not touch him yet may you be privileged to converse with him and to know that he is risen you yourselves being risen in him to newness of life
556726 to know a crucified saviour as having crucified all my sins is a high degree of knowledge but to know a risen saviour as having justified me and to realize that he has bestowed upon me new life having given me to be a new creature through his own newness of life this is a noble style of experience short of it none ought to rest satisfied
556727 more times than not hes had our number to get on a guy like that it just shows it was our day at the plate
556728 i dont know if i could try to go out there and give up 14 hits
556729 it seems like i was making some pitches and they were hitting them and then there were times when i was missing my spots and they were hitting them pretty hard it just was one of those days
556730 i dont care how many griffeys we bring in here weve got to start pitching better you got to go out there and do it
556731 after the konerko home run i kind of stepped off the mound and said ok take a breather its 3 0 and you havent got an out in the second inning so lets just settle down and throw some strikes
556732 you get to where youre completely soaked and you keep going into the dugout and drying out
556733 as soon as you get back on the mound youre drenched again
556734 will not give up a single iota of its nuclear rights
556735 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges
556736 seriously seeking to increase the size of joint investments to more than 3 billion over the next years
556737 it really helped me that it started raining because i was able to go in the locker room and talk to my coach
556738 it wasnt easy to talk to my coach because he was really mad
556739 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for
556740 its weird because most weeks on tour theres probably 20 guys or 10 guys who can win on the last day
556741 but obviously if parker is 20 under john rollins has to shoot 10 under if parker is even par so it does put a stretch on everyone including me
556742 but parkers never won before so you never know he might shoot a couple over and around this golf course anything can happen you can hit good shots and get a bad bounce and be really in trouble
556743 it was my first time having a lead and i didnt really approach it the right way and learned a lot from it
556744 that one i looked past the finish line too early and this one im looking forward to the first shot on the first hole tomorrow and thats as far as im going to go
556745 american police officers arrested in mexico for smuggling in firearms ammo
556746 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
556747 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
556748 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
556749 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
556750 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
556751 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
556752 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
556753 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
556754 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
556755 seorang anggota polisi hamas dan seorang anggota brigade ezzedine al qassam sayap militer hamas tewas

556757 menembakkan rentetan mortir pada polisi hamas dan juga sebuah roket di kota gaza
556758 ada beberapa penangkapan dan akan ada banyak lagi kami telah minta polisi untuk tegas
556759 ada kebohongan kami tidak pernah menembakkan roket atau rentetan mortir hamas adalah satu satunya yang melakukan kejahatan kami telah minta semua kelompok palestina islamis dan nasionalis untuk menggunakan pengaruh mereka agar kejahatan itu berhenti
556760 serangan hamas itu telah merusak seruan saya bagi dialog nasional antara kelompok kelompok palestina

556770 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
556771 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
556772 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
556773 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
556774 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
556775 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
556776 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
556777 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
556778 we simply wrote to qantas asking for a briefing after all the investigations are done its being portrayed that somehow were demanding meetings he told aap
556779 if you were qantas now youd be seeing the faa as being engaged in some sort of public attack on them and were not
556780 qantas is a safe airline it remains a safe airline and all were saying is obviously there was an incident which was serious and could have been much worse and you would expect us to want to sit down with them
556781 were flight attendants we have to fly in the aircraft its just a natural request
556782 i always seem to pitch pretty well here for the most part they got a great team over there they play to the best of their abilities they bunt they steal they put pressure on the pitcher they get guys over i admire their approach fortunately it worked out ok for me today
556783 you got to give the other guy on the mound some credit he pitched a good game he held us in tact
556784 i think getting that first ball in the fairway tomorrow will be key
556785 and then ill have some numbers in mind from there
556786 i did a real good job with that after that i gave myself some great chances you can score from the fairway out here but you cant attack from the rough
556787 i did good i set some mini goals for myself i wanted to get to 20 under and did that so i have to re set some goals and get ready for tomorrow
556788 if a strict investigation is not conducted over this tragic incident that would be like throwing cold water on expectations for developments in inter korean relations through south north talks
556789 the act was wrong by any measure unimaginable and should not have taken place at all
556790 the south side should be held responsible for the incident
556791 the south korean tourist intruded deep into the area under the military control of the north side all alone at dawn going beyond the clearly marked boundary fence even her shoes got wet
556792 i heard a scream which made me turn left and i saw a person collapse while three north korean soldiers ran out from the mountain
556793 soldiers nudged the fallen person by their feet but i never thought that person was a tourist
556794 im hopeful that stanford hospital wont spend time and healthcare dollars fighting their own patient care workers it has been ten years since seiu first organized workers at stanford hospital now its time for the hospitals administration to work constructively with the union and community leaders
556795 its unconscionable that any reasonable person would consider this an acceptable tactic to get their point across
556796 we are working hard with the other agencies and committing advertisement click here to find out more all available resources to follow all possible leads we urge anyone with information to come forward
556797 with what happened previously and what happened last week with the pamphlets we just assumed
556798 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
556799 these unconscionable acts put the researchers their families including their children and their neighbors in grave danger
556800 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
556801 the personal safety and security of all our students faculty and staff is our highest priority
556802 are they stupid enough not to see that i am a chemist not a biologist
556803 were talking about situations where the animals in question are receiving very little in the way of veterinary care
556804 you cant have an animal producing antibodies without having it in a terribly deteriorating condition
556805 ive not held a mouse in my hand my whole life
556806 i would be glad if they want to inquire about it directly rather than printing a threatening message and scaring my family
556807 dont they realize that it is just a kind of terrorism
556808 i remain committed to crafting language that provides an additional tool for law enforcement to protect researchers and their families who have and continue to be targeted by extremist organizations
556809 the legislature needs to send a message that violence or threats of violence are not acceptable
556810 o grupo parlamentar do ps acompanha o processo do estatuto sem dramatismos

556828 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
556829 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapon states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
556830 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
556831 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
556832 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
556833 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
556834 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties

556989 a key effect of devaluation is that it makes the domestic currency cheaper relative to other currencies there are two implications of a devaluation first devaluation makes the countrys exports relatively less expensive for foreigners second the devaluation makes foreign products relatively more expensive for domestic consumers thus discouraging imports this may help to increase the countrys exports and decrease imports and may therefore help to reduce the current account deficit

556994 when the rates were getting too low they switched to competing by way of advance ratio versus selling price
556995 in other words if lender a was offering 90 financing lender b would go to 100 financing then lender c would advance 100 of selling price plus costs then to 105 etc we have seen the u s equity lenders now go to 130 of selling price giving back 10 15 to the purchasers to help buy furniture large electronic products groceries while the remaining 15 20 was eaten up in fees

557002 what do the wars in iraq and afghanistan and the economic recovery in the united states have in common more than one might expect to judge from the last couple of rounds of us growth figures 2004
557003 during the second quarter of 2003 when the war in iraq was in full swing some 60 per cent of the 3 3 per cent gdp growth rate was attributable to military spending
557004 the war has been a large part of the justification for the bush administration to run ever widening budget deficits and those deficits predicated largely on military spending have in turn pumped money into the economy and provided the stimulus that low interest rates and tax cuts on their own could never achieve
557005 these are the us governments own projections and we all know they have every incentive to accent the positive if this is the best they can do at this point then you know things are not just bad they are calamitous

557007 the us government will be spending money they dont have which means creating more of it out of thin air and diluting the value of all the dollars that came before it doesnt take a harvard mba to know that the kind of deficits projected above guarantee a persistently weak dollar higher inflation and higher interest rates going forward
557008 the great depression ended as nations increased their production of war materials at the start of world war ii this increased production provided jobs and put large amounts of money back into circulation
557009 world war ii spending often required a conversion of plants designed for civilian good production into military factories and back again over the 9 year period substantially higher federal tax rates that were paid by the majority of households imposed much stronger fiscal drags on the benefits of the spending finally less of the military spending was earmarked for wages and use of locally produced inputs which reduced the direct stimulus to the local economy

557027 he looked like he was having a hard time i dont know if it was the rest or the intensity i would say that one more day of rest would have been just what the doctor ordered but you gotta give lowell credit too because they were hitting him if you hit youre going to win its all about hitting

557043 me and former hopkinton and current post 59 teammates dan muscatello mark sanborn and mike preite spent a lot of time at coach ps baseball coaches academy just hitting off tees and trying to get ready for the upcoming season
557044 i could never picture myself standing in the outfield and getting one or two balls in a game
557045 apart from the pitcher i think the catcher is the second most important position on the field
557046 they both want to win and theyre both very good teachers of the game
557047 every coach has their own approach to the game you get two different kinds of perspectives you learn from each coach in different ways
557048 calling pitches is definitely an art form its definitely difficult and its definitely something that you get better with over time
557049 ive learned a lot about calling pitches from coach p i try to think about the game almost the way he would try to think about what pitches he would call in certain situations
557050 he keeps me on my toes and vice versa its a nice relationship
557051 if someones throwing in the higher 80s its a lot tougher to catch than someone who just throws 80
557052 getting the opportunity to catch guys like white and johnson and jack murray has definitely helped me to become a better catcher
557053 its a step up the competition is that much better the players are that much better and you have to work that much harder its going to be difficult but its going to be fun too something that im looking forward to
557054 its definitely special something that we dont take for granted at all
557055 getting out of zone 4 was unbelievably difficult and its something really special that im going to remember for a long time
557056 getting that taste of what the state tournament was like last year definitely made us hungrier to get back there this year
557057 secara kuantitas internet makin berkembang terutama banyak akses di perguruan tinggi perkantoran sehingga makin banyak orang menggunakan akses internet
557058 do you support the presence of the coalition forces in iraq
557059 we know that the bush and blair governments lied about their motives for war we know that thousands of civilians were killed
557060 two of the words most sophisticated armed forces smashed iraqs cities to pieces killed thousands of civilians and captured iraqs oil
557061 a war planned long in advance against a soft arab target that nobody much liked
557062 war in 2003 was about protecting british and american interests not liberating iraq liberation was the means to dress war up as legitimate
557063 it is in the interest of every country and the duty of every government to fight and destroy this threat to our people
557064 a fight between civilisation and terror because theres no neutral ground between good and evil freedom and slavery and life and death
557065 when i arrived in early may there was no traffic on the streets except us military vehicles no shops were open no policemen were on duty
557066 the claims that iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction is likely to be true of iraq it is not news its been known ever since 1995 its not difficult to guess that the claim was part of establishing a pretext for a large scale attack on iraq
557067 a slim majority of the population us and europe believe the war was justified and has made the united states and the world a safer place
557068 mr bushs electoral prospects are now a prisoner of what happens in iraq
557069 the absence of weapons of mass destruction the original justification for the war
557070 far more expensive than envisaged both in financial and human terms
557071 more electricity schools open regularly teachers being paid more medical supplies better shops and wages rising
557072 far less drinking water then one year ago inflation and security problems
557073 mr bushs determination to invade and tony blairs determination to support him have put global institutions and international process at risk the iraq war was an act of exceptional recklessness a year ago it remains that today even through life in iraq is in many ways the better for it
557074 believe that their lives will be better in a years time
557075 the people of iraq are free to voice their opinions celebrate their religions without ending up in one of the countless mass graves that pepper the countryside
557076 iraqis and foreigners working to improve their nation because the iraqi people persevere they believe for the first time in decades in the future they now have hope
557077 a free press many satellite dishes hospitals being reopened more medicine clean water waste disposal electricity internet access bridges and roads have been repaired new currency has been introduced and foreign banks have been given permission to operate
557078 the united states and britain share a mission in the world beyond the balance of power and the simple pursuit of interest we seek the advance of freedom and the peace that freedom brings for the first time in decades the iraqi people are enjoying the taste of freedom great challenges remain in iraq but the progress we made this year has been enormous our resolve to complete the task we set ourselves remains undiminished our partnership with the iraqi people is for the long term
557079 saddam is no longer in power a brighter future they will make their own with the support of their friends and partners in britain the united states and around the world
557080 the cut and thrust of the current debates about wmd and the difficulties encountered over the past year will continue however the accomplishments made over the past year should not be dismissed
557081 one year ago the us and britain went to war and they celebrated a victory as saddam husseins statute topped in baghdad saddam has been captured and his sons killed
557082 far more troops have been killed not a day goes by without an attack on troops or civilians
557083 the mirror was among the voices warning that winning the peace would be much harder
557084 no prospects of our forces returning home in the near future if this is victory it is a very hollow one
557085 a year ago life began to change for the better in iraq
557086 cars instead of donkeys and hope for the first time
557087 there is no neutral ground in the fight between civilisation and terror
557088 there can be no separate peace with the terrorist enemy
557089 any sign of sign of weaknesses or retreat simply validates terrorist violence and invites more violence for all the nations
557090 each must be answered with greater determination deeper resolve and bolder action against the killers
557091 the united states and great britain share a mission in the world beyond the balance of power or the simple pursuit of interest we seek the advance of freedom and the peace that freedoms brings
557092 for the first time in decades the iraqi people are enjoying the taste of freedom great challenges remain in iraq but the progress we have made this year has been enormous our resolve to complete the task we set ourselves remains undiminished our partnership with the iraqi people is for long term

557109 le stylo waterproof reminds me a lot of my beloved mac technakohl liner like technakohl it has a twist up tip and a creamy formula that glides on without tugging or pulling le stylo outlasts technakohl though when applied to the waterline which is why im using it today it also sports a sponge smudger on one end handy for diffusing harsh edges and lines
557110 high definicils lancomes new release of their legendary glossy black definicils mascara features an improved soft rubber brush that makes definicils much easier to apply
557111 lancomes got a video on youtube celebrating pixel pink color fever shine lipstick the limited edition shade created for fashion designer thankoon panichguls spring 2008 runway show while the entire video is an interesting insight into the inspiration behind the lipstick and the backstage goings on at ny fashion week my favorite parts are the animated sequences of moving paintings by experimental filmmaker jeff scher

557113 if i were forced to pick just one eyeshadow palette to bring with me on say a three day trip to las vegas that palette would have to be the new lancome stylish neutrals color design artist palette

557121 that may be in the future in the near term we want to launch these with great customization and a great library of accessories this fall
557122 i think there is a lot more we can do with them

557128 i cant believe you did it that took some legendary will power
557129 onze activiteiten worden vaak omschreven als ongehoord persoonlijk redelijk pikant en behoorlijk onverwachts maar eigenlijk organiseren we workshops projecten en lezingen gebaseerd op literatuurstudie of leefwereldonderzoek en ge nspireerd op actuele tendenzen in jongerencultuur waarbij we de grenzen van ons doelpubliek doorbreken en breed gaan in onderzoeksdomein en omdat we ons steeds weten te omringen met de juiste partners worden uit nlopende perspectieven gekoppeld aan diversiteit kwaliteit en exclusiviteit
557130 that offenders of islam would face up to a year in prison and or a fine if the victims are minors the prison term rises to seven years
557131 these notices are in place for a reason to protect victorians
557132 we dont take the decision to ban products lightly but once we have made that decision we will do all that we can to ensure unsafe products are not sold in victoria
557133 traders need to be aware if you sell banned products in victoria you will be caught and prosecuted
557134 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times
557135 that clear direction has to be based on responsible economic management and responsible economic management remains anchored in a 22 billion budget surplus a buffer for the future
557136 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world
557137 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
557138 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
557139 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view
557140 yes the economy is slowing yes we need to take the steam out of inflation but people talking recession are getting way ahead of the facts
557141 creo que en varios peri dicos viene esta noticia jeje pero de nuevo lo digo hasta no ver no creer
557142 i want tiffanys but i dont want to pay for it
557143 la realidad indica que no hemos conseguido ganar hasta el momento de local tras campeonar en el apertura pero creo que el resultado final fue justo ya que por momentos jugamos bien y por otros se nos complic fue bastante parejo
557144 cuando nos toque el partido de copa pensaremos en el partido de copa cuando nos toca un partido del campeonato pensamos en el campeonato
557145 no hay que restarle m ritos al sport ncash que jug un buen encuentro
557146 decir que la llamaban 15 veces al d a es poco incluso a la una de la ma ana le preguntaban d nde estaba muchas veces se les encontraba en la esquina de la casa controlando a mi hija y dici ndole c mo se ten a que vestir es decir la acosaban demasiado
557147 open season for speculating that all my favorite themes and cards and the most powerful cards from the last standard season are on the verge of being reprinted
557148 pick which of these cards will be reprinted in the core set
557149 i am positive this is whats in the next set
557150 i think mark rosewater should print this to fix the standard format
557151 hallowed fountain is not bad for standard is not is not is not 1
557152 i just went out and gave myself some great chances
557153 you can score out here if you are playing from the fairway it gets tougher from the rough
557154 i take no encouragement from anything in the polls that weve seen published today
557155 what i know is that queenslanders expect a lot from their government
557156 for the first time since returning to democracy in 1983 the institutions were able to seriously discuss a law that for the first time relates to the redistribution of income
557157 would be far better to be able to do it before the next federal election
557158 im not going to give gratuitous advice to my federal colleagues but brendan nelson is on the record as saying that he supports a merger at a national level
557159 i think it can be used as a template and i think that following on from the discussions that we are having nationally it can be achieved in the short to medium term
557160 now people obviously they have some concerns with a mixture of egos and all those sorts of things
557161 the number of retail outlets selling ethanol blend has increased three fold over the past two years concentrating in queensland and new south wales and to a lesser extent in south australia and victoria
557162 price would be a contributor but i think people are interested in being more environmental about their fuels and also promoting an alternative source of fuel
557163 it is a surprisingly resilient result amid all the bad business news
557164 while were seeing some high profile cutbacks like starbucks and don smallgoods were not yet seeing major job losses
557165 we simply wrote to qantas asking for a briefing after all the investigations are done its being portrayed that somehow were demanding meetings
557166 if you were qantas now youd be seeing the faa as being engaged in some sort of public attack on them and were not
557167 qantas is a safe airline it remains a safe airline and all were saying is obviously there was an incident which was serious and could have been much worse and you would expect us to want to sit down with them
557168 were flight attendants we have to fly in the aircraft its just a natural request
557169 we just need to reload and get on with the rest
557170 there have been plenty of sides beaten by geelong its what you do over the three or four weeks after you play geelong whether it puts you back into your shell or whether youre just prepared to get on and play footy
557171 we were five wins out of six games leading into this game its five out of seven now its pretty reasonable form at this time of the year so weve just got to reload
557172 we want to be able to jump out of bed on a monday morning and know that theres something hanging on the following saturdays game or sundays game or whenever it is the next weekend
557173 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
557174 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
557175 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
557176 it was a safety factor we wanted to make sure that he was outside and to apprehend him outside away from his child
557177 her first words were that she was very happy to see nice people she was pleased with that and she was ecstatic about that
557178 i made a decision not to politicise the games this is for athletics
557179 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
557180 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
557181 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
557182 weve dominated this race twice now and not closed the deal
557183 if i did speed in pit lane i just couldnt see a thing there so when i saw the flashing lights at the end of pit lane i just went
557184 im aware that he saw the footage on tv last night and chose to attend mt druitt police station
557185 the victims were courageous in first surviving the incidents and then reporting the incidents to police and secondly having the nous to contact police again once they sighted the offender
557186 todo el mundo piensa que vista es una mierda pero es porque no lo conocen bien
557187 todo el mundo adora a obama y piensa que no me voy a comer un duro por favor votadme
557188 quite a bit worse national australia bank chairman michael chaney says
557189 where it goes from here well have to wait and see its possible the situation will get quite a bit worse in credit markets
557190 we certainly dont believe any downgrade would be appropriate mr chaney said
557191 things are going extremely well but thats a matter for us to sit down and talk to the ratings agencies and to assure them thats the case
557192 worst case scenario for some of its collateralised debt obligations
557193 that of course depends on the state of the world and whether things get worse in different markets he said
557194 thats the same as any situation in banking at any time
557195 cinco ministros um procurador geral um assessor especial da presid ncia um vice ministro cinco deputados um verador e um juiz
557196 i set aside my personal agenda for the will of spirit
557197 zeist flyers nog geen twee jaar oud 2x kampioen in resp 3
557198 our goal now is absolutely to make the wicked film but much like judy craymer wouldnt give up screen rights to mamma mia until the stage show had reached its pinnacle marc and stephen schwartz are very mindful of the right timing but were dying to do it
557199 obviously were not the first newspaper to be affected by the continuing downturn in advertising
557200 we are hopeful that by opting for our employees to voluntarily sign up for buyouts we can avoid any type of layoffs going forward
557201 are you the one they talk about so much going to college
557202 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter
557203 younger students have read about and heard about it but they havent lived through those administrations and all the things that occurred then joann offers a very welcome perspective shes lived long enough to see a great deal
557204 i dont have that many more years to live and i want to do good for humanity while im here
557205 there are some things going on that i cant talk about
557206 i dont think im free to say whether i have gotten a letter or not
557207 a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who in the judgment of the prosecutor is a putative defendant
557208 the administration is lengthening the working day and cancelling the lunch break
557209 well do our best to satisfy everyone and will do some extra decorating with balloons
557210 newly weds are calling it the day of triple infinity and believe a wedding on this day will bring luck
557211 its not really right to say responsibility for family happiness and prosperity can be attached to a particular date
557212 smart people talk because they have something to say stupid people talk because they have to say something
557213 the longest continuous deployment of any united states ground combat military unit during operation iraqi freedom
557214 will you regret it when youre 30 if you dont go
557215 nathan kensinger generally does not ask have camera will trespass on brooklyns waterfront new york times
557216 its clear that the next trend in gaming is going to be bringing real objects into the virtual world playing not against other gamers but people doing the real thing
557217 at this point we have lots of interest and we are looking for the right partner to launch
557218 formula 1 and similar complex simulation games are getting less mass market nowadays compared to their more arcade style heyday in the late 90s
557219 this sort of feature would probably appeal to the hardcore gamer or f1 fan more than a mass market gamer
557220 with that we know the location and the velocity of the car
557221 combined with dgps we know the location of the car to within less than 30 centimetres
557222 we also store the data so not only can you play the game in real time but you can replay races at a later date
557223 if hamilton is driving behind you he cant see you in the game so he would drive right through you
557224 so the ai takes over at that point and you see a very realistic overtaking
557225 we go for optimal realism but the game experience has to be right
557226 there is a huge difference between what happens in the real world and what happens in video games even the most realistic simulator has to bend real world physics to make the game more fun
557227 i know i wouldnt even get close to the lap times that lewis hamilton could run unless my car in the virtual world had a load of extra grip and power which might defeat the point
557228 smart people talk because they have something to say stupid people talk because they have to say something
557229 what is this ive been playin for 36 hours straight and weve done nothin but sit in this hole in the ground lookin at bushes
557230 when you first get injured all you want to do is get up and walk you just want to be normal again
557231 i would have never tried it i always thought about it but i never would have done it
557232 theres nothing like being on a wave it makes you feel independent and kind of normal again
557233 when guys are out doing rec therapy theyre on with their life again they typically use less pain meds they sleep better theyre happier
557234 a lot of times in society youll get stared at and glared at when youre out there people dont know you have a leg until you are right up on them it kind of moves them a little bit too
557235 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
557236 children have never been very good at listening to their elders but they have never failed to imitate them
557237 nothing you do for children is ever wasted they seem not to notice us hovering averting our eyes and they seldom offer thanks but what we do for them is never wasted
557238 of course youre a girl too grandma but youre ok
557239 students feel the administration is doing a pretty good job
557240 i thought i was going to do a little better because i thought i was pretty well prepared
557241 im going to be a freshman in high school so it was really important for me to go out and get some best times before we start the high school season
557242 i just wanted to make the best of it and work really hard
557243 i wanted to make sure that as a leader of the team i could show the rest of the swimmers what i can do
557244 i know there will be high expectations for me in high school but im looking forward to it
557245 swimming is very important to me so thats the only sport im going to do in high school
557246 its such a different format than you have in high school because its in meters and its a four day event
557247 it teaches the kids more like what its going to be like in college than in high school but its still championship meet experience
557248 ultimately were going to have to grow the business in a tough market
557249 im not too worried about them running out of cash
557250 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
557251 its just a question of how severe the downturn is and how extended it is and obviously how successful the new models are that theyre looking to launch
557252 sooth and calm the people who work here as well as the patients
557253 its ok that we want to take care of the caregiver
557254 its very stressful work that we do in caring for others when theyre sick and if were not well ourselves if were stressed we cant do the best job
557255 help to alleviate stress and anxiety while loved ones are in critical care
557256 i find the sound environment is important in decreasing stress
557257 the only nos we get are if people have allergies
557258 studies show that petting a dog for 15 minutes helps lower blood pressure
557259 for patients with dementia they cant really follow words or the tv is too distracting it can help to calm and sooth them and give them something to focus on and decrease their agitation or their anxiety
557260 everything that ive done has changed me and helped me to grow into what id be doing next
557261 we go above and beyond patients dont have to pay for it its not a moneymaker its something thats feel good something to give them joy more than they would expect from a hospital stay
557262 bobs mom mary ellen asked me to come speak on behalf of all the folks here at wcco
557263 i consider it a great honor bob was a dear friend of mine as you probably know ive gotten to meet such wonderful people through bob tiffany wilson owner of v i p hair amp nails his girlfriend his good buddies his mom and sister robin i can tell you this i think his family is changed not just because of obviously all bobs been through but just meeting everybody here minnesota and the twin cities will always be a second home for them
557264 john reger was just as much there for bob as my husband greg and tiffany john and greg and tiffany too drove bob to doctor appointments and were there all the time
557265 i am a dreamer a hopeless dreamer in a split second i ask three hundred thousand questions to myself come up with the same number of answers and build a concept idea and a vision most of it is based on gross assumptions silly ideas and a wandering mind
557266 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
557267 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
557268 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
557269 i cant believe someone took the time to do this
557270 if only my late grandparents could see that times have changed that women today dont need to bank on marriages to move up in the world

557332 ambas candidaturas se han formalizado bajo la modalidad de independientes y eso nos exige trabajar el doble
557333 lamentablemente el servel aun no nos autoriza iniciar la campa a de firmas para legalizarnos y esto nos ha perjudicado sin embargo estas municipales nos dar n la oportunidad de seguir socializando nuestra propuesta pol tica a nivel de base y preparando el terreno para cuando demos el vamos a la campa a que esperamos sea el segundo semestre
557334 lautaro y freire son comunas de alta poblaci n mapuche y donde est n las bases fundadoras del partido lo que esperamos con estas candidaturas es acrecentar adem s nuestra base de militantes y posicionar a wallmapuwen de cara a nuestra campa a de legalizaci n ambas comunas son emblem ticas para nosotros y esperamos que al igual como sucede hoy con luis penchuleo en lautaro sigan surgiendo desde las comunidades liderazgos j venes que refresquen la pol tica mapuche y constituyan un real aporte a nuestro pueblo

557432 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world
557433 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
557434 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
557435 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view
557436 yes the economy is slowing yes we need to take the steam out of inflation but people talking recession are getting way ahead of the facts
557437 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times

557441 estimated 103 million persons to immigrate over the next 20 years fully one third of the current us population
557442 both cira and existing immigration law is that immigrants in convertible or lpr status have the right to bring spouses and minor children into the country spouses and dependent children will be granted permanent residence along with the primary immigrant and may also become citizens in addition after naturalizing an immigrant has the right to bring his parents into the u s as permanent residents with the opportunity for citizenship there are no numeric limits on the number of spouses dependent children and parents of naturalized citizens that may be brought into the country additionally the siblings and adult children along with their families of naturalized citizens and the adult children and their families of legal permanent residents are given preference in future admission but are subject to numeric caps
557443 all of the immigration discussed to this point would be legal immigration if illegal immigration continued after enactment of s 2611 the inflow of immigrants would be even greater although illegal immigration is considered a major problem the proposed legal immigration under cira would dwarf it numerically the net inflow of illegal immigrants into the u s population is around 700 000 per year 16 legal immigration under cira would exceed five million per year seven times the rate of the current illegal immigration flow annual legal and illegal immigration together now equals about 1 7 million future legal immigration alone under cira would be three times this amount

557449 prescribe the manner in which such acts records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof
557450 the word marriage means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife

557455 when god solved mans aloneness by creating one other person a woman not a man not a few women not a community of men and women
557456 sexual behavior of a society plays a role in either building or eroding a civilization prager
557457 overcoming prejudice which remains at the root of most opposition will be difficult if we believe in autonomy and believe that the institution of marriage is valuable it is difficult to justify depriving homosexuals and lesbians of this treasured form of human association
557458 state of virginia was challenged by loving it could have argued that the incidents of marriage were designed with same race marriages in mind
557459 real harm being gay consists of being the victim of homophobia and heterosexism
557460 not such a queer idea is there a case for same sex marriages

557466 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for
557467 its weird because most weeks on tour theres probably 20 guys or 10 guys who can win on the last day
557468 but obviously if parker is 20 under john rollins has to shoot 10 under if parker is even par so it does put a stretch on everyone including me
557469 but parkers never won before so you never know he might shoot a couple over and around this golf course anything can happen you can hit good shots and get a bad bounce and be really in trouble
557470 it was my first time having a lead and i didnt really approach it the right way and learned a lot from it
557471 that one i looked past the finish line too early and this one im looking forward to the first shot on the first hole tomorrow and thats as far as im going to go
557472 i thought it was going to be the worst birthday ever after the first three holes
557473 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for
557474 its weird because most weeks on tour theres probably 20 guys or 10 guys who can win on the last day

557498 the war on doctors is so intense that those who treat persisting lyme regularly face investigation and possible loss of their medical licenses by infectious diseases society of america dominated state boards
557499 id never been sick a day in my life i didnt even have a primary care physician
557500 it began with lightheadedness and fatigue i got fevers it just kept going
557501 i believe i was bitten several months before i got symptoms by that time i was so sick nobody thought it could be lyme

557503 the more negative results i got the more they thought i wasnt really sick
557504 i say never mind the test go ahead and get the antibiotics

557506 if people get treated right away they usually get better
557507 my books are all how to books how to make life better how to assess whats going on
557508 shortly after i was married i became active in natural childbirth i had so much to say i had to put it in a book

557511 we hope these events foster positive relationships between the officers and the citizens and lets the criminals know that we are all fighting back
557512 we want people to know that together we can make a difference

557518 when american families are burdened by skyrocketing gas prices it is a shame that the majority leadership of this congress would call for early adjournment for a five week recess rather than bring bipartisan energy legisla tion to the floor for a vote

557520 this bill gives voice to the beleaguered american public which has said enough and is calling for a comprehensive solution to the energy crisis

557530 the test match in wellington against the springboks was good and france in 2004 was pretty good so it would be in one of the top three or four performances

557644 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself

557764 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
557765 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
557766 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
557767 hiv aids continues to be a public health emergency that has not received adequate nor appropriate attention as a nationwide priority
557768 to make measurable progress against hiv we need to know whether infection rates are going up which groups are becoming infected and which prevention activities reduce new infections
557769 we need a comprehensive national aids strategy with measurable outcome targets a timeline for action increased funding and a particular focus on those most at risk including racial and ethnic minorities

557868 props for their ability to get so much speed out of their cars
557869 i think anything you say here is banal because the china market is exploding but in an interesting way
557870 what is interesting about china and what is not always appreciated by the outside world is that you have a very
557871 distribution here is several light years ahead of say india but is still relatively rudimentary as opposed to what it could or should be the next phase is further development of the walmarts and tescos and of wine getting into the home and away from food and beverage establishments
557872 i also believe the imported bulk wine market will drop whats interesting is the leaps the chinese wineries will go through they dont see a disconnect between building a wine industry to produce chinese wine while using foreign grapes but at a certain point rules will be drawn
557873 china is going to be huge in tourism in all sorts of ways ingoing and outgoing the wineries have deep pockets so i think wine tourism will and should develop in china and this itself will help to boost wine consumption and make drinking wine a lifestyle activity
557874 at that point it will be interesting to see china overtake france ironically in the sophistication of its wine tourism just as argentina and chile already have france despite developments in napa valley in new zealand and elsewhere in the new world has not learned tourism lessons significantly arguably china is already offering better wine tourism than france
557875 about the once near unanimity of the wine community that
557876 the big problem we have here is i dont know how many chinese wines ive tasted i know grace sino french dragon seal and some others use grapes grown in china but how many use imported wine i just dont know
557877 overall we need to ask more questions of wine it doesnt always have to be bordeaux style varieties in 75 centiliter bottles with corks
557878 what i do very much appreciate about china compared to some other countries is that the chinese know what they dont know chinese wineries will admit to not making wine as good as it will be to adding imported wine and to being very pragmatic what they will be doing in five years will be very different a lot of chinese are visiting other parts of world and looking at how things are being done in the wine sector i would be very unsurprised to see some quantum leaps over next five years a decade at the outside
557879 we will make sure that kingsnorth power station has the very best available technologies in place so that we can make sure that we can produce power for one and a half million homes in the cleanest and most efficient way possible

557881 in the face of all that we know about climate change its just absolute madness that we go down the path of burning more coal which is the dirtiest most inefficient fossil fuel there is
557882 we still believe that the overwhelming majority of people who are coming along to protest are lawful individuals

557909 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
557910 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
557911 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right
557912 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much
557913 but there is a tiny part of me that kind of prefers she does stay dead

557918 we tried to be as patient as we could during this process and i can tell you he worked extremely hard to get back but in the end it just wasnt there
557919 it just was more or less kind of the overall picture we didnt think was going to help us get to where we wanted to be

557939 hey man what does it mean to be a christian to be saved
557940 we are saved by grace through faith in christ jesus
557941 for we are saved by grace through faith in christ jesus
557942 the kingdom of god doesnt fly into our country on air force one
557943 for he will be so close to the throne of god and we at such a distance i doubt well get a glimpse of the man
557944 one of the greatest challenges for the citizens for a safe and healthy asheboro was to overcome the obstacles of the temporary downturn in the economony the current high energy prices and the loss of jobs in our region due to the transitioning industries of textiles and furniture
557945 none of this had anything to do with alcohol sales but the pro forces capitalized well on these economic factors in promoting the need for alcohol economic development time will tell if they can deliver on their promises
557946 in truth and love to present a much needed and positive message to our community
557947 we still believe that the economic costs due to alcohol related problems far outweigh any proposed benefit
557948 our research showed that alcohol problems economically drain the u s society of approximately 186 billion per year
557949 our faith in god for our families for our community and for our future
557950 many different denominations came together and we began city wide canvassing going door to door making phone calls and praying
557951 we used an old timey political grassroots get out the vote campaign
557952 we had about 75 people prayer walking the city during the vote
557953 we worked our no list down to the last voter these men on our executive board organized the effort and mapped it down to the last detail
557954 they alcohol forces dont care how much you rant and rave in the pulpit but they despise organized effort
557955 i would encourage any town facing this not to overlook the aspect of the prayer walks voter identification and voter turnout
557956 there are no shortcuts to these battles it takes being conscientious about every aspect and working it right down to the last
557957 what these folks grasped early on and didnt let go of is the fact that every single vote counts and you cant assume you have those votes until you are sure they have made it to the polls
557958 i do not believe that you are a good christian
557959 instead i believe that you are a bigot hiding behind christianity
557960 sexual perversion that can be changed clearly implies a belief that gays and lesbians have intentionally chosen behavior that deviates from the accepted norm
557961 the modern day equivalent of separate drinking fountains for whites and blacks
557962 a refusal to do business with someone based on a sincerely held religious belief that homosexuality is wrong would violate the law that threatens the religious liberties of every christian jewish or muslim business owner who operates a business on faith based principles
557963 would someone else enjoy reading my copy of procrastinators weekly
557964 yes as long as theyre not you know from 1965
557965 all of the peabody mysteries are tongue in cheek tributes to the mystery genre in general and english female detectives in particular
557966 the cast of characters comes straight out of agatha christie with its masquerading nobility craven widows the begrudgingly accepted american the poor young lovers and the rejected social climber
557967 would you like to see more drilling and refining of oil
557968 well i shouldnt keep my baby warm because this coal will emite co2 into the atmosphere when we have broken our economy and destroyed our way of life with this suicidal nonsense we can at least take comfort that we wont be listening to the environmental lunatics anymore
557969 it was just incredible his hearing returned to normal in an instant
557970 i had always suspected jerome had stuck something in his ear when he was little and that was causing the problem but the doctors and hearing specialists said it was wax and he would probably grow out of it
557971 i am amazed they didnt spot something as obvious as a cotton wool bud
557972 it was very strange at first to be able to hear everything
557973 leaving early and my response was that i was either just coming from or leaving for a meeting i had the same reaction you did and because this person doesnt know my over work habits of course this person may have just been making conversation but it still irked me
557974 going through the weight loss program i try to eat it more broiled and baked
557975 but i can tell you this any southerner knows that if youre not gonna eat the skin dont bother with calling it fried chicken
557976 im glad to hear that romney did that because that means im going to win alabama georgia tennessee arkansas oklahoma all these great southern states that understand that the best part of fried chicken is the skin
557977 that weekend every newscast in texas led with president ford doesnt know how to eat a tamale
557978 and many believe he lost the presidency and there are a lot of people who will believe forever that it was the shuck on the tamale not jimmy carter that beat gerald ford in 1976 so who knows
557979 the president who repeatedly pledged to cut the deficit in half has instead brought it to a record high president bush squandered a 236 billion surplus ran up record deficits and added nearly 4 trillion to the national debt mr president we will be forever in your debt
557980 my senatorial salary is way too small to survive hell do you know how big the insurance bill is on eleven mansions
557981 i thank you kindly for your support now if youll excuse me i have to go take a nationally televised dump on your daughter
557982 big deal i went to high school with him conan obrien
557983 i cant believe hes taking another trip to a foreign country
557984 thanks for doing over 250 000 worth of renovations to my house and not charging me for it sincerely senator ted stevens

557992 both prime ministers said we need to overcome these problems and move forward
557993 prime minister gilani said he would conduct an independent investigation into the kabul blast he will discuss the matter with afghan president hamid karzai and will look into the matter
557994 i am meeting president karzai tomorrow if they give me evidence then we will look into the matter
557995 the indian prime minister was relatively frank in expressing his views
557996 the present state of unrest in the region demands more cooperation for combating terrorism and extremism as both countries are victims of this menace
557997 the indian prime minister said all outstanding issues including kashmir between india and pakistan would be resolved amicably he assured his full support and cooperation in this regard
557998 a few communalists in jammu have blockaded the national highway because of which fruit is rotting in kashmir and traders face losses worth crores of rupees
557999 fruit traders have taken heavy loans from various banks and if the government does not give them security their produce will rot which will have a direct impact on the banks as well
558000 the central government should seriously try to contain the situation or otherwise things will get out of hand triggering off a powerful mass movement which will be difficult to control
558001 a few communal parties in jammu are responsible for the state of affairs and they want to tear this state asunder and separate kashmir from the country
558002 it would be better to call an all parties conference at the national level to organise public opinion to resolve the issue
558003 i will continue to be a worker of the congress yet for the sake of the people of jammu i have decided to support the agitation
558004 the agony which the people of jammu were facing since years have finally brought them out of their house to fight for the rights
558005 the issue raked up only when the administration bowed before the separatists and revoked the order
558006 now people of jammu who believe in nationalism are no more in a position to tolerate discrimination and finally the emotions broke out
558007 the pogrom in jammu is being carried out at the behest of new delhi and hindu fanatics are being pushed into the province from outside the state
558008 after that fruit traders will head for muzaffarabad despite any force that is used against us we will rest only after taking our produce across the border
558009 we have made commitments with our business partners in delhi kolkatta mumbai bangalore etc and we have to fulfill our obligations we will request the government of pakistan to allow us passage through wagah border to deliver our consignments to the indian markets
558010 rein in communalists the protestors said that fruit worth lakhs of rupees was rotting because hindu fanatics had held up trucks from reaching jammu
558011 trucks stranded on the way to jammu have been looted
558012 a large quantity of fruit including pear razakwari apple and hazratbali is rotting in the fruit mandi in jammu
558013 the trucks dispatched for jammu yesterday were ransacked by hindu rioters in bhatandi the fruit destroyed and the drivers beaten
558014 since orchardists and growers cannot withstand such huge losses for long we appeal to the government to provide security to the trucks
558015 the police does not appear interested in helping us or giving us security
558016 we are not even allowed to draw water from the hand pump and have to face immense difficulties on other counts also he said
558017 we have cleared around 300 vehicles including passenger vehicles which were stranded on the highway

558086 lets take a holiday boil a second egg for breakfast fall in love
558087 we cant possibly dont you know theres a war on
558088 allah is our objective the prophet is our leader the koran is our law jihad is our way dying in the way of allah is our highest hope
558089 when we hear about islamist resistance lets try to put ourselves where they are and try to see it from their point of view
558090 were no longer based on the existence of nation states we must reinvent ourselves
558091 for atheists considered worthy of the death penalty by islamists to team up with their ultimate opponents in attacking canadian civic society demonstrates the fundamental bankruptcy of these two political ideologies
558092 there are more people now saying they dont have answers
558093 this is the new frontier how are people going to eat when theres global warming and when so few will be able to grow food
558094 the issues of justice inequality and poverty are common themes we can work together on they are concerns of conscience
558095 anything and everything that is possible in life and reality happens all at once time space matter human emotions and choices everything
558096 human perception of reality is a series of still frames that goes in order much like a
558097 this in theory can accommodate the idea of free will vs predetermined fate that is to say both can exist at the same time because everything has happened past present and future at once which covers fate but mankind has the choice of perceiving one set of reality hence the free will part
558098 and wonder why you took a job no human being is capable of doing
558099 just the typical stereotypical jealous catty woman whos jealous of another woman over a man you have a crush on she won you loss deal with it
558100 what you are is free and you dont recognize it my friend
558101 what do you mean im free and dont know it
558102 sounds like to me for the first time in a long time you get to take care of yourself
558103 sure you got the kids but you dont have them all the time and you already know how to be a dad now you gotta figure out how to be devlyn
558104 look for as long as ive known you youve been taking care of somebody it was your mom when you were in high school and then you got married and had the kids and you busted your ass for 10 years trying to give them everything you could
558105 now the kids are older and spending more time at their moms and youve got no one to take care of
558106 so now buddy you gotta learn to take care of you
558107 thats what im mean about you being free outside of work and taking care of the kids there arent any expectations except for the ones you make for yourself i think what youre not realizing is that youre scared of not having expectations youre free and you dont know what to do with it
558108 youre getting a bit weighty but i guess thats why i called you isnt
558109 i think you gotta look at it as a do over man
558110 remember when were kids and when the ball went to the street or someone messed up a game we called a do over what you dont realize bud is that at 34 youre getting a do over how many of us get that opportunity theres a lot of people thatd kill to be in your shoes
558111 funny i never had looked at my situation like that
558112 it never occured to me that others would kill for the marbles to be racing around in their heads
558113 no i dont think they want the confusion but i think plenty of people would like the chance to start from zero
558114 not that youre starting from zero because you got the kids and are good at your job but you find the right pieces to plug into the rest of the equation and youre going to be far better off than most
558115 i knew there was a reason i called you tonight
558116 who knows maybe you saved the call for when you really needed it
558117 ill check back in with you in a couple of days remember the phones always on
558118 for all gordon browns talk of creating a fair society with opportunity for all the reality is very different
558119 a child from a deprived background is 193 times more likely to leave school without a single good gcse than they are to get three as at a level
558120 this level of inequality is a national disgrace and a block on opportunity reforming our schools and strengthening our families is the key to building a better happier and fairer society

558171 why would you go get a new bike when there is a perfectly good bike in the garage already that i do not want anymore
558172 the concern is that people will say lets repeal these laws
558173 not in my shower campaign is not focusing on whether gender change is immoral but asserts that cross dressing men could use womens restrooms and locker rooms and possibly assault the women
558174 our concern is this would leave the door wide open for an individual to dress as a woman giving him access to private areas
558175 but who will you and your children see in the showers your fines could actually be as high as 5 000 for failing to accept a man in a dress as a female or for complaining about indecent exposure when the male undresses right next to a young girl in the female locker room
558176 it was fantastic and i loved every minute of it i had set myself the target of finishing the marathon somewhere between five and six hours so i was really happy to reach my goal
558177 when i crossed the finishing line it was a very emotional experience
558178 the hardest part was at mile 21 i had run all of the way until there but then my legs started seizing up and i think that was where i hit that infamous wall
558179 but i just gave myself a good talking to and remembered that i was doing this for a great charity that gave me the motivation i needed to keep going and complete the run
558180 my target was 1 300 and i am still getting people donating money now i have raised 1 600 so far and i cant thank everybody who has contributed enough
558181 i have been looking on the internet to try and find the next run i can take part in i just want to get back into the gym and keep up with the training
558182 it was a really great day and i had a fantastic time im a mother with two young kids and if i can do it then anyone can
558183 if it was later on in the pregnancy i would have been so devastated
558184 i wanted to wait to tell people until christmas when id be three months along just because we didnt want to have to go through that if we miscarried again
558185 having someone imply that its better that your baby died is incredibly painful
558186 even now after seven years and four children later we still cry about our twin boys and our second miscarriage
558187 we were both really shocked about how many people come on every day and how many people need it
558188 everyone grieves and heals so differently its such a very personal thing
558189 ill have kids come up and say i love your book and that makes me feel wonderful
558190 i really truly didnt know if id ever be happy again
558191 and i knew there was a huge problem and i knew that the baby wasnt going to live the first time i went in they couldnt see the babys heart her name was grace and she had hypoplastic left heart and thats where the left side of the heart doesnt form i went into preterm labor at 32 weeks after that it was time to go home and that was one of my toughest days going home from the hospital without a baby you go home and youre just broken hearted
558192 im reading this poem and im just crying but its a good cry for me it answered the why for me it helped me so much i had to share it with other people i could not keep it to myself
558193 the book helps us talk about babies that die and children that die because sometimes i think its taboo
558194 people say i hate to say anything because i dont know what to say
558195 i had an emergency c section he was born at 29 weeks eight minutes of cpr he was a very sick baby and we did not know if he would make it
558196 health services are improving and there are greater advances in neonatal care however these are happening against the background of a changing population
558197 people are getting fatter and there is also an increase in the number of people from ethnic minorities it is well recognised that people from these groups have maternal conditions like diabetes which are known to be linked to stillbirth
558198 the death of a baby is a tragic occasion for all involved parents relatives and equally for healthcare professionals
558199 the rcog supports good research that examines why these deaths occur and would like to see increased investment in midwifery and senior consultant staffing to help improve outcomes for mothers and their babies
558200 these new figures confirm that more research is desperately needed into finding the causes of stillbirth so that more babies lives can be saved through developing preventative measures
558201 obesity in pregnancy is a significant problem in this country and has massive implications for both mother and baby it carries an increased risk of major pregnancy complications including miscarriage pre term birth and stillbirth
558202 it was so hard to see our friends have baby after baby and we had none

558208 the first two months of bed rest it was quite strange just to be home in the house after being someone who was always on the go
558209 when i got there the devil played tipsy toe with me but i had to shake that off i went through the first portion and got through to nine months
558210 you have people who have been married for years and they dont have kids then you see others have them but cant take care of them and you want a child
558211 i feel he had these things prepped and he just wanted to see how faithful we were to him
558212 azzariah is my mothers day gift and for my husband shes his fathers day gift
558213 god had everything planned and prepped and it was in his time god knows exactly what to do and when you just need to be patient relax and wait on him

558399 so we know there are some connections between thyroid function and cognition but i dont think anyone has figured out yet what the exact connection is
558400 whether maintaining hormone levels within limits will actually prevent dementia i think might be a big jump

558405 im disoriented or i need another class on orienteering mr grylls you are grammatically incorrect you are wrong
558406 i hate a clean desk my desk is workable and is organized and categorized as needed
558407 the relationship is over life dealt me a blow and its time to move on
558408 you pretend to be communicating when youre actually stifling communication
558409 a phone conversation is like wildfire you dont know where its going to go
558410 economics satisfied the two most basic needs of investment bankers
558411 it took watching his son being paid 225 grand at the age of twenty seven after two years on the job to shake his faith in money
558412 for me however the belief in the meaning of making dollars crumbled the proposition that the more money you earn the better the life you are leading was refuted by too much hard evidence to the contrary and without that belief i lost the need to make huge sums of money the funny thing is that i was largely unaware of how heavily influenced i was by the money belief until it had vanished
558413 i said that people never change their lives that in any case one life was as good as another and that i wasnt dissatisfied with mine here at all
558414 when i was a student i had lots of ambitions like that but when i had to give up my studies i learned very quickly that none of it really mattered
558415 i hadnt understood how days could be both long and short at the same time long to live through maybe but so drawn out that they ended up flowing into one another they lost their names
558416 many of my friends drew me aside in those early days before i had defined myself in relation to the island and told me they envied my opportunity for solitude for reflection and for a time to assemble my thoughts and generate ideas almost every man dreams of a place where he can withdraw into himself away from the roar of engines and the push of crowds
558417 we learned the instruments in the orchestra then promptly forgot them we were cocky about our music me the gang bay cloven shy koski and the boys
558418 shanghai is an old brown riverside city with the look of brooklyn and the chinese who are comforted by crowds like it for its mobs and its street life
558419 gaocheng was perfect in its ruin and decrepitude it had been a renowned city for well over a thousand years and now it was a pile of dust and crumbling mud so far it had been spared the final insult tourists but one day when the iron rooster turned into a streamlined train they would find even this place east of turfan twenty five miles into the desert
558420 transportation in china is always crowded it is nearly always uncomfortable it is often a struggle the pleasures are rare but they are intense and memorable travel in china i suspected would give me a lasting desire for solitude
558421 tibet is the one great place in china that the railway has not reached the kunlun range is a guarantee that the railway will never get to lhasa that is probably a good thing
558422 the shanghainese have a sense of belonging to a city that resembles the new yorkers strong identification with new york it is a sense of shared experience the same headaches and complaints a sort of attitude it is a also a sense of being possessed by the place locked in its embrace and embattled at the same time
558423 my own dark time as i call it the time of my loneliness was most of my life as i have said and i cant make any real account of myself without speaking of it the time passed so strangely as if every winter were the same winter and every spring the same spring and there was baseball i listened to thousands of games i suppose
558424 sinners are not dishonorable people not by any means but those who are dishonorable never really repent and never really reform
558425 and the fact is it is seldom indeed that any wrong one suffers is not thoroughly foreshadowed by wrongs one has done that said it has never been clear to me how much this realization helps when it comes to the practical difficulty of controlling anger
558426 it had always seemed so implausible that the world could be indifferent to its own existence and although shed long ago given up on churches kathy couldnt help believing in some fundamental governing principle beneath things an aspect of consciousness that could be approached through acts of human sympathy
558427 the british troops committed every wanton wickedness that a brutal revenge could stimulate
558428 its harder at night when were sitting at home watching television or just alone in our rooms my 7 year old sleeps with me at night instead of reading a story well talk a lot about daddy and marc that seems to help
558429 people went around to stores that donated raffle prizes or some people just brought in things and said raffle this off
558430 look at all the people who made things for the bake sale
558431 i contacted the new hampshire motor speedway up in loudon with the bulletins link on what happened
558432 they donated two tickets to their next nascar race it was a lot of e mails and a lot of phone calls
558433 tom spent his life helping others living a heroic life
558434 marc died trying to save his father in a heroic death
558435 do we extend our contract and make it a point to stay here what is it that were going to do
558436 i remember when the vietnam soldiers came back and the way they were treated
558437 it was disgusting this wall would help them heal i want to help them heal
558438 i think seeing the wall would make people appreciate and understand it
558439 i lost a lot of good friends during the war
558440 what makes the decision hard is the unknown am i going to have an injury or an illness or something that i cant forecast now
558441 were asking patients to take much more responsibility for their overall health
558442 but we dont do a good job of providing the information to help them make good choices its the paradox of choice the more choices the harder it is to choose
558443 if we feed someone too much information when they arent ready its like standing them up in front of a fire hose
558444 the choice became clear for me i chose a hysterectomy but it took two months of study and discussions with my doctor
558445 she wanted to know how a choice might affect my work my family life and lifestyle really so different from when the doctor just recommends what to do
558446 some patients and some doctors already are engaged in patient centered care but some arent yet comfortable sharing authority
558447 eventually id like to integrate this approach into all of our care
558448 i feel like dr morrissey really wants to know how were doing as a family
558449 he takes care of all three of our boys and he probably listens more than he talks which is kind of unusual for a doctor it means we have to do some thinking and planning too but im all for that
558450 that changed her life and not for the better i really see how i have to take responsibility for my own health
558451 id guess that maybe one third of minnesota doctors know something about patient centered care and thats going to grow dramatically in five years
558452 this is more than just getting patient consent for a procedure
558453 i need to speak carefully here because i dont want to sound critical of doctors but we were trained much better to act than to listen
558454 when consumers are actively engaged at every level of health choices we get better health outcomes eliminate unwanted unneeded and wasteful services increase the effectiveness of care and lower the costs
558455 eighty percent of the medical costs today are for chronic illness among 20 percent of the population
558456 the best way to fight rapidly rising costs of health care is to create healthier minnesotans who are less dependent on medical intervention
558457 the parents of my patients love it they tell me how empowering this process is for them
558458 i cant know everything i depend on the clinic team and even on parents to help educate me
558459 i put in a lot of unreimbursed hours but its worth it it makes me a better doctor and usually it makes the job much more rewarding
558460 im a nurse for gods sake im informed but we were struggling so much its been an awful journey in many ways
558461 without our faith and without dr burt i dont know where wed be
558462 the strain of autism on our family has been almost overwhelming at times but jack has progressed so much now he smiles hell let me hug him sometimes he talks he doesnt hit people or scream very often anymore thats because ive had amazing support from dr burt shes jacks doctor but shes also my partner in caring for jack
558463 what mattered to that guy at that time in his life
558464 youre always afraid youre going to choose the wrong thing and its going to cost you
558465 a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
558466 defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
558467 badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
558468 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
558469 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
558470 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
558471 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
558472 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
558473 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
558474 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
558475 i cannot imagine luca being able to play in the dfb pokal against erfurt
558476 you cannot take muscular injuries lightly i think the earliest he could possibly be back is for the opening game of the season against hamburg
558477 what pleased me was our defence and we did a lot of things well
558478 however we took a lot of time to get into the game
558479 in the first half especially we looked tired and its not like weve played a lot of friendlies
558480 but we began to get more into it in the second half and we succeeded in doing well
558481 winning this competition doesnt interest me apart from the fact that its always nice to win something
558482 it would be nice to win for the fans but they know that were working to prepare ourselves well for a good season
558483 hes fantastic its as if hes always played with us
558484 hes everywhere even when we dont have the ball and his passing is brilliant it really seems as if hes been with us for years
558485 it was a difficult match where only one goal won it
558486 it was a very difficult match for us even though we are aware that we dominated
558487 but its the team of the highest level and we are already trying to work towards the preliminary round of the champions league
558488 tomorrow we have another difficult game and then we have another one against manchester united in a few days time
558489 but these are matches that are at the highest level matches that the team need and matches that we need to win
558490 but i think we have a good team and that we have a great desire to win and that things are good all in all
558491 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
558492 he wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that although it created a lot of anxiety for him and in fact he stayed because of family matters
558493 he stayed for his father who he is extremely close to and for his whole environment therefore he was unable to create that split that they expected and we were hoping for
558494 to be fair to nicky shorey he has made it clear from this time last year that he would prefer to leave and ply his trade elsewhere
558495 we as a club have an asset and it is a delicate balancing act between trying to satisfy the demands of the player and also trying to satisfy the demands of the football club
558496 we had a good talk yesterday there was a little bit of interest last week and the chances are he will be gone by next week i am 60 40 convinced that he will be gone
558497 the offer was a firm one but we have no need to sell anyone and im not going to give anyone away
558498 it has to be a realistic bid in terms of market valuation and bear in mind that 12 months ago he was coming off the back of playing two games for england against brazil and germany
558499 i dont feel disposed to let him go for nothing i appreciate it is a year on from that particular moment but as yet the valuation is not what we find acceptable
558500 two bob is miles away as far as i am concerned if it is not meeting the valuation then it is a long way away
558501 i have been fairly fair with shorsey and he accepts the situation so clarity would be best for everybody
558502 we are in that ridiculous situation that if nobody comes in for him then he will still be here
558503 i would dearly love him to be playing for us as he is a significant player for us
558504 so there are about three balls up in the air for us and it is unsatisfactory for him for us and for everybody
558505 there remains the subject of keven mirallas which doesnt depend on us
558506 the player wishes to come to st etienne but he is currently at the olympic games

558518 its not that i am asking you for a favour in fact if you dont want to do it there are many others that woud love you so dont think i am suppose to serve you and send you reminders because its not part of my job scope

558523 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
558524 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
558525 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
558526 standing up here on this platform is much different than i imagined
558527 the reality of getting into the pro football hall of fame didnt really hit me till a few days ago and then to see the magnitude of all of this and all of you its been something amazing
558528 my dad provided my sister and me with a lot of great advice throughout the years
558529 like most kids we dont always follow that advice a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they are humans and they make mistakes too i guess i didnt listen to that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
558530 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
558531 you bet youre life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
558532 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a prize fight or other sporting events
558533 he taught me about honor commitment love religion hard work and respect
558534 it happens when youre protecting someone like john and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
558535 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
558536 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players jack lambert jack ham bobby bell and many others
558537 letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news media offices and two democratic u s senators killing five people and infecting 17 others
558538 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
558539 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
558540 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
558541 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
558542 hiv aids continues to be a public health emergency that has not received adequate nor appropriate attention as a nationwide priority
558543 to make measurable progress against hiv we need to know whether infection rates are going up which groups are becoming infected and which prevention activities reduce new infections
558544 whoever was making the music so thumpy and jumpy would stop
558545 i think the discussions are moving ahead and i hope we have something resolved by monday i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
558546 you see these two gentlemen im so happy to have them on the team theyre capable of taking us where we have to go
558547 with any situation like this you really cant discuss it publicly
558548 resolved by tomorrow i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
558549 when hes healthy he doesnt throw picks that was not characteristic of chad pennington
558550 it makes me sick looking at him at least he didnt wear his super bowl ring out here
558551 i told him i didnt know if id let him in here hes still got buddies over in new york
558552 alternate events as they come along during the year concerts a tractor pull whatever we have
558553 were going to try to incorporate as many of those ideas into the way we package this psl program to be as fan friendly as we can recognizing the nature of our fans and how long theyve been fans and where they sit
558554 were not going to be able to make everybody happy
558555 you bet youre life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
558556 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
558557 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
558558 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
558559 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
558560 60 of all houses built today in the united states will have at least one resident with a long lasting severe mobility impairment at some point in the lifetime of the house
558561 ive been locked in for so long i havent really had the opportunity to sit back and enjoy it
558562 a lot of people have tried to film dune they all failed
558563 with the liberal party youre dealing with not a question of personalities its policies
558564 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer is the second highest interest rates in the developed world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and work choices
558565 so on that score ive got to say its quite clear cut to me that the liberals whoever their leader is have a real problem with their policy direction for the nations future because of the legacy they left us from the past
558566 ive got to say their problem is one of policy of being locked so far into the past theyve lost their way personalities i think are secondary to it
558567 im not going to make any judgments with regards to the federal coalition they will decide their own course of action
558568 but what i would say is i agree with trade minister simon crean i mean we can speculate and talk about things but people dont necessarily reward those people that want to go in there and to basically destroy behind the scenes
558569 but id just say in so far as brendan nelson is concerned he has shown tenacity and its a difficult job being an opposition leader i know that but youve really got to do the hard yards and thats what its all about
558570 it government doesnt fall out of the sky in your lap youve got to work for it
558571 compare it with the way prime minister kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan are going were on the verge of a rudd recession after 11 golden years of costello and howard
558572 now of course wed like costello to come back because he can manage the economy and rudd and swan cant
558573 if i was peter i would have taken up the leadership back in december
558574 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
558575 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once and sadly have not yet had and probably never will
558576 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
558577 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would
558578 het is net uit met maarten en je hebt nu al een ander
558579 the test match in wellington against the springboks was good and france in 2004 was pretty good so it would be in one of the top three or four performances
558580 probably the best thing is that we were under a lot of pressure and it was a group of young people as well
558581 for those guys to experience that and come through on the other side i think is really good for them
558582 i dont want to have to click on a button or key to switch my outfits what a pain

558630 the extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of palentology the evolutionary tree diagarms that adorn our textbooks is not the evidence of fossils

558704 la pir mide era uno de los s mbolos que representaba la deidad desconocida y sin nombre en los cultos precristianos siglos despu s fue resucitada como s mbolo de la destrucci n de la iglesia cat lica y cuando la primera fase de esa destrucci n hab a sido producida por aquellos que la hab an infiltrado y desde entonces ocupaban algunos de los lugares m s altos en la iglesia la reprodujeron como se al de su xito

558745 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
558746 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
558747 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
558748 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
558749 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
558750 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
558751 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
558752 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
558753 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
558754 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
558755 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
558756 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
558757 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
558758 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
558759 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
558760 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
558761 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
558762 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
558763 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
558764 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
558765 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
558766 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
558767 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
558768 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
558769 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
558770 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
558771 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
558772 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
558773 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
558774 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
558775 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
558776 11 hours you want to drive 11 hours with a newborn

558779 the spirit within us and the spirit of a place and then that third thing that story like thing the ignition or spark that occurs between us and it the braid of those two things flowing like some river
558780 ive lost much of my heart and the spark or fire that once created or produced the art of fiction so dominant is the landscape into which ive moved that it seems almost always that the shadow of this place is behind me watching sometimes with interest other times with boredom but almost always watching whatever it is im up to on the page
558781 sometimes it is a matter of holding on to the raw innocence and power and uncompromising intolerance of injustice that one possessed as a young person but tempering it with kindness learned along the way other times it is a matter of losing those things and then mid journey having to go all the way back and look for them again

558787 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
558788 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
558789 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
558790 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
558791 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
558792 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
558793 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
558794 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
558795 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
558796 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
558797 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
558798 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
558799 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
558800 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
558801 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
558802 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
558803 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
558804 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
558805 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
558806 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
558807 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
558808 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
558809 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
558810 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
558811 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
558812 preparations were made to repair the burnt bridges between havre de grace and baltimore a singular railway battery was constructed in philadelphia to be used for the protection of the men engaged in the work wrote historian benjamin lossing in 1866
558813 it was a car made of heavy boiler iron musket proof with a 24 pound cannon mounted at one end on a gun carriage this was to fire grape canister and chain shot while a garrison of sixty men inside would have the opportunity to employ musketry through holes pierced in the sides and ends for the purpose

558818 mr jerah stone of the elizabethtown essex county n ew jersey has constructed a steam gun which has discharged two hundred times in a minute throwing a ball at each discharge with much greater force than a common rifle the gun is easily directed and with that apparatus weighing only five cwt it is easily transported on wheels the expense of constructing the gun is not great and the principle of it is applicable to one of any desirable caliber it is believed that guns on the same principle might be rendered highly efficient in the defensive operation of war it is supposed that mr stone does not claim entire originality in this application of steam power but only very great improvement mr stone has constructed a fowling piece which with powder and ball he discharged fifteen times a minute

558820 i got to know him a little bit just on the set a bit and when i saw the movie i was bowled over on set we would be chatting about this or that then the director would say were ready heath and then hed go straight into that maniacal thing
558821 i told him i dont have energy to do that what you do
558822 though i thoroughly enjoy it you know i was never an alcoholic but it is true i was on occasion very very drunk but you know i used to go out on the town with peter otoole so i had a bloody master craftsman teaching me
558823 but the difference with us we were always getting drunk with alcohol
558824 thats why the 60s were so successful because with booze youre all out together drinking what screwed up the 70s was drugs because you had to stay at home and take the bloody drugs and you couldnt go out or you got busted by the police
558825 i didnt have the money to go to the theater
558826 every grief is unique life doesnt necessarily make us better thats not lifes business life gives what it gives takes back what it takes back and its our business to sort things out for ourselves as best we can
558827 eclipsed by the popularity of the navajo and the exoticism of the native american
558828 this has been overlooked and ive been overlooking it as well
558829 to suppress this fantastic tradition is to deny the cultural contribution of a large number of people
558830 because of the crudeness of the tools the designs were a lot bigger
558831 the owner is tired of it hes been making it every day for 20 years
558832 to write a poem out of nothing at all is tates genius just about anything can happen next in this kind of poetry and that is its attraction
558833 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
558834 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
558835 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
558836 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
558837 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
558838 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
558839 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
558840 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
558841 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
558842 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
558843 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
558844 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
558845 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
558846 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
558847 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
558848 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
558849 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
558850 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
558851 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
558852 who are open to doing something on the production side
558853 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
558854 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
558855 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
558856 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
558857 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
558858 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
558859 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
558860 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
558861 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
558862 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
558863 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
558864 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
558865 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
558866 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
558867 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
558868 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
558869 i do believe that his goals and his priorities and the visibility that hes given the issue has been good for america and the world

558915 that is true valkyries are specifically are women that has the power that balances to gods own power a normal valkyrie can only cast five prayers and they suddenly collapse and die but a strong valkyrie can cast more spells but it will tore their brains and die because of too much stresss as for claire shes weak if she casts another prayer she will surely die

558932 i think the housing market is really the central element of this crisis

559054 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
559055 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
559056 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
559057 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
559058 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
559059 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
559060 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
559061 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
559062 i love the fact that she has been able to hold her own for 25 years

559065 in 2001 there were just 801 girls per 1000 boys and the ratio is still going down stop female foeticide and infanticide
559066 this was a shock to the whole community it still is
559067 thats all people can talk about today about how bad it was
559068 all legal and equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case
559069 todays situation is that neither the return of palestinians nor formation of a government and even the collapse of the zionist regime is unachievable
559070 the government has lost the philosophy of its existence and is no longer capable of implementing the policies of the united states and europe in the region
559071 more joint harmonization could be effective to continue bilateral ties on a suitable basis
559072 some countries want to create distance between iran and syria but they are making a mistake as the two countries will forever stay beside each other
559073 theres still a long way to go it wont be the last time we lose and well win another game at some point as well
559074 the all blacks built pressure and didnt allow us to build any pressure
559075 they were very effective on the tackle line on the gain line very effective around the breakdown and as a consequence we werent able to get into the game
559076 they profited from some of that pressure that they built and its one of those days where you try and create momentum
559077 sometimes you look outside the square to do that and you just have a sense that nothings going to work
559078 its not one well look back on and reflect on with a lot of pride and that also probably reflected the way the game went

559081 the olympic games have become the occasion for a broad crackdown against dissidents gadflies and malcontents this summer although human rights activists say they have no accurate estimate of how many people have been imprisoned they believe the figure to be in the thousands
559082 would not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
559083 the opportunity for foreign governments to use the olympics to pressure china on human rights has passed in any case it is a new low for the international community to see all these state leaders going to beijing without saying anything about the repressive environment in which the games are being held
559084 security forces seem determined to prevent those and other dissidents from finding an echo in the media particularly the foreign media that have been reinforced in china during the olympic period to do so they said authorities have devised a panoply of measures ranging from warnings intimidation surveillance travel restrictions and house arrest to outright detention
559085 hes put so many contingencies around it that i wonder in fact i question whether he would do it at all
559086 it may be a way for him to gain favor during the election and tube it later because all the contingencies werent met

559091 you have the convenience of holding this story in book form it is a complete narrative which you can look through at your leisure you can go back and reread sections which because of the marvelous writing the book contains you have undoubtedly already done you could even scan to the end and read the last page know that by doing so however you would violate every holy and honorable storytelling principle known to man thereby throwing the universe into chaos and causing grief to untold millions your choice
559092 its not a distraction to rice but its a distraction to the other competitors because it puts a giant cross on your shoulders and they will do everything they can to bring you down says andronicus who was a regular swimsuit cover girl during her career

559096 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
559097 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
559098 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
559099 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
559100 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
559101 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
559102 victorious warriors win first and then go to war while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win
559103 so what are you gonna do about it home slice
559104 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
559105 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
559106 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
559107 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
559108 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

559117 i had rather be a canker in his hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though i cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied that i am a plain dealing villain i am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore i have decreed not to sing in my cage if i had my mouth i would bite if i had my liberty i would do my liking in the meantime let me be that i am and seek not to alter me

559119 the most dangerous man to any government is the man who is able to think things out for himself without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest insane and intolerable and so if he is romantic he tries to change it and even if he is not romantic personally he is very apt to spread discontent among those who are
559120 too many people in this gutless world have come under the impression that writers are a race of finks queers and candy asses to be bilked cheated and mocked as a form of commercial sport it should be noted therefore in the public interest that some writers possess 44 magnums and can puncture beer cans with 240 grain slugs from that weapon at a distance of 150 yards

559136 this cancer is an issue that affects the entire ballarat region
559137 its a real privilege to talk to the future leaders of this region
559138 we have a critical core group of scientists and a fully equipped laboratory
559139 smythesdale in the north west of the shire is only 20km from ballarat and considerable community and business development is proposed in the town through the smythesdale central project and the sewering of the town

559141 the old area consultative committees were largely used to process regional grants
559142 we want them to be used to transmit information to government in canberra
559143 we have held consultations with a range of regional multi government groups and a community consultation workshop mainly for not for profit groups recently at mccallum disability services
559144 typically people dont talk about craigslist because its almost like breathing
559145 thanks for the sh y jobs and the crazy roommate

559149 when liu won the gold medal in athens i had tears streaming down my face
559150 he is beautiful i love him i sooo want him to win
559151 in my heart i would like to feel ordinary and its hard to feel like this now
559152 otherwise not only will our generation lose face but also our ancestors
559153 officials told us if liu could not win a gold medal in beijing all of his previous achievements would become meaningless
559154 i think we just have to hope for everybodys sake that things go well
559155 a lot of times we forget that there are churches and congregations that are in the community working for social justice reaching out to create peace places of inclusion for all people
559156 and to some extent it appears that tennessee valley was targeted because of this legacy but its also a rich legacy to become aware of
559157 killing yourself over a myspace boy come on i mean yeah your fat so you have to take what you can get but still nobody should kill themselves over it
559158 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
559159 little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
559160 he made friends effortlessly disliked no one and accepted everyone for who they were
559161 tim spent his life travelling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone
559162 he was just an all around great guy he was never in a bad mood he always liked to have fun no one can ever replace him tim was one of a kind
559163 maybe those passengers will forget the incident one day for his friends and family this is one of the most tragic days of our lives
559164 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
559165 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah together with jesus in the kingdom of god
559166 youll see this interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it although i was never a terrorist i was a part of them surrounded by them all the time
559167 i respect israel and admire it as a country im opposed to a policy of killing civilians or using them as a means to an end and i understand that israel has a right to defend itself the palestinians if they dont have an enemy to fight will fight each other in about 20 years from now youll remember what im telling you the conflict will be among various groups within hamas theyre already beginning to quarrel over control of the money
559168 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine
559169 more than that an entire society sanctifies death and the suicide terrorists in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheikhs tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds and that causes the young people to imitate the suicide bombers in order to achieve glory ill give you an example i once met a young man named dia tawil he was a quiet boy an outstanding student not a muslim extremist and not radical in his ideas against the israelis i never heard extreme statements from him he didnt even come from a religious family his father was a communist and his sister was a journalist who didnt wear a head covering but bilal barghouti one of the heads of the military arm of hamas in the west bank didnt need more than a few months to convince him to become a suicide terrorist
559170 telepresence is our response to the current green issue especially in the contact center industry that involves executives frequently flying in and out of the country
559171 for us its about how do we bring world class systems and capacity to relevant countries like australia
559172 for us this means bandwidth take up in the provinces
559173 we suddenly had requirements for high bandwidth leased circuits when there was no demand for this before from our end
559174 after we won the competition we were given an additional 2 000 as production budget to create the viral video it took us one day to create the first video then another one day for the re shoot
559175 for them to get out and get active it keeps them younger bill i think hes like 67 but hes probably the most active and energetic one out here and i think events like this probably keep him active and being young
559176 when we pulled up all the people here and the cars its just very overwhelming its great to see that theres so much community support for the soldiers
559177 if the page count of rpgnet threads had anything to do with game sales then white wolf could fund its own mars exploration program off of the proceeds from exalted
559178 hennet looks like he doesnt do anything but smite orcs and make perfectly nice young gay 14 year olds feel insecure about their bodies
559179 this rule or set of rules if used will destroy the fun in this game for me
559180 for it is time to seek the lord until he comes to rain righteousness on you
559181 but we do see him who was made for a little while lower than the angels namely jesus because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor so that by the grace of god he might taste death for everyone
559182 behold i stand at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in to him and will dine with him and he with me
559183 o magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together
559184 greater love has no one than this that one lay down his life for his friends you are my friends if you do what i command you
559185 we americans have real enemies we do not need to make enemies of each other
559186 bernie mac is still alive and being treated in a chicago hospital for pneumonia and is expected to make a full recovery
559187 we once again ask that the press respect his privacy and that of his family
559188 mr mac is responding well to treatment and will be released soon
559189 he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well
559190 lamar is well qualified for this position and he will provide excellent leadership to the morganton and marion newspapers
559191 lamar has a proven track record of success over several decades in the industry and understands the importance of innovating for the future providing compelling and relevant content for readers and increasing value to advertisers
559192 i am extremely excited about moving to north carolina and becoming part of the morganton and marion communities
559193 both papers have a strong history of local community coverage it is my intent to see that tradition continue
559194 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
559195 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
559196 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
559197 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
559198 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
559199 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
559200 will not give up a single iota of its nuclear rights
559201 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges
559202 seriously seeking to increase the size of joint investments to more than 3 billion over the next years
559203 i am on the train to get somewhere not to sit around
559204 i understand why they are doing it but i dont think it will be popular with riders
559205 we are shias and sunnis who gathers us is god and mohammed no sunni no shia we have one goal stay together god bless you all who separates us is not from us
559206 iraqis have a strong sense of national identity that transcends religious and political lines
559207 the recent out pouring of national pride at the asian cup victory of the iraqi soccer team showed that this sense of national pride remains strong despite all the sectarian strife and violence
559208 this is a much higher proportion than we found in other middle eastern capitals
559209 the escalating violence in iraq gives a bleak impression of that countrys future
559210 sectarian conflict seems to be increasing on a daily basis with militias massacring hundreds of sunnis and shiis solely on the basis of their religious identities
559211 yet it would be a mistake to think that this bloodlust represents widespread sentiment among iraqis as a whole while neither american nor iraqi security officials have yet found a way to tame the militias the iraqi public is increasingly drawn toward a vision of a democratic non sectarian government for the country
559212 sectarianism is something shameful among iraqis especially the middle class
559213 as a lawyer in the civil courts in baghdad i have seen sunni marrying shia arab marrying a kurd
559214 i myself am a sunni arab but my brother has been married to his shia arab wife for more than 40 years and their eldest son married a turkmen girl i really cannot see how these people iraqis factions would fight each other
559215 definitely the number of mixed marriages has declined recently but we have to take into consideration that marriage cases in general have fallen due to deteriorated security situation and immigration people are leaving iraq looking for safety
559216 families of young couples usually get embarrassed when i ask them do they want the marriage to be finalised according to sunni or shia islamic sharia they do not want to be labelled as sectarians and you see each family encourages the other to tell the judge to finalise the marriage according to its sect
559217 due to the current situation in iraq i and zainab agreed to live in a room at my parents house my family promised zainabs family to treat her like a dear daughter
559218 curfew starts at eight in the evening and that would not allow us to hold a proper wedding party
559219 we missed the scene of dozens of nicely decorated cars touring the streets of baghdad after midnight to celebrate a newly married couple
559220 believe it or not the sunni and shia thing is mentioned in our house for sake of humour you know like i joke with my husband and tell him that sunni are not good husbands or they are stingy things like that just to laugh i do not know how they introduced sectarianism to all aspects of life the situation is awful now
559221 every member in my tribe sees other members as cousins i cannot see myself or any one of my tribe fighting his own people and family for political or sectarian beliefs
559222 my evidence for that is both shia and sunni jubor tribesmen go to the same tribal authority to judge between them they do not go to sunni or shia clerics
559223 we are losing each day an average 50 to 60 people throughout the country if not more if this is not civil war then god knows what civil war is
559224 we are passing through a difficult period right now but the attachment of iraqis to their country will prevent such a war
559225 all net profits from geoffrey beene will be donated to philanthropic causes that support innovative research with cutting edge focus on signature solutions to a host of medical educational and societal issues
559226 ive never seen anything like it in all my life
559227 i know there are some who bristle at the notion that faith has a place in the public square but the fact is leaders in both parties have recognized the value of a partnership between the white house and faith based groups
559228 the challenges we face today from putting people back to work to improving our schools from saving our planet to combating hiv aids to ending genocide are simply too big for government to solve alone
559229 when will he propose how will he propose will sparks be flying inside of me then comes the big day knowing she is head over heels for him he takes her for a stroll under the moonlight sky and he leads her to a candle light dinner after the romantic di
559230 conditions today are not unsafe but certain things like the installation of a modern fire alarm system should not wait
559231 we are not going to repeat the mistakes of the 1970s when new york city put off needed infrastructure repairs and ended up paying a lot more to fix the problems after it was almost too late
559232 that money has a placeholder in the budget but only a small fraction of that will be used this year
559233 just because the contract is registered in the city record doesnt mean its going to go forward anytime soon
559234 my mother hated her body i hate my body and i am sure my daughter will grow up hating her body its always been this way
559235 thats just the way it is some things will never change
559236 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
559237 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
559238 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
559239 its going to be tough when we close the doors
559240 people come in here all the time and say i remember buying gym clothes here or i bought my first bike here and i want to buy one for my kid

559258 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
559259 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

559263 it seems the centre only understands the voices of the valley and not of the jammu region it is trying to find a solution through force and is not initiating a dialogue
559264 this can only further deteriorate the situation we demand that the government should revoke the cancellation of land allotment
559265 with the nuclear agreement on path the government can concentrate single handedly on ensuring that inflation rate is brought down significantly
559266 the astronomical increases in prices of oil and other essential commodities in world markets have had a major impact on the price situation
559267 time and again we have been reminded of the absolute criticality of party unity and discipline at all levels we must now look ahead and together meet the challenges ahead
559268 vindication of the civilian nuclear agreement which occasioned the vote and an endorsement of the policies of the upa
559269 our needs for electricity are so great and growing that we cannot depend only on coal and water resources we have to use nuclear energy in a big way
559270 the agreement will benefit our farmers our families our trade and industry and our economy we must communicate to people at large the significance of the nuclear agreement so that they are able to see the correctness of our stand
559271 this must be condemned in the strongest possible terms the agreement will benefit india and all indians irrespective of caste language region or religion
559272 siguen defendiendo la informalidad en el campo y los mecanismos de elusi n fiscal
559273 el escenario que genera la crisis mundial de alimentos puede y debe ser aprovechado por nuestro pa s pero las oportunidades de los sectores concentrados no pueden excluir al resto de los argentinos y condicionar nuestra seguridad alimentaria
559274 un sector hist ricamente privilegiado como el que representa luciano miguens deber a hacer un esfuerzo para tener m s apego a las reglas minimizar su fervorosa construcci n de pol ticas de concentraci n econ mica y embarcarse en competir en un mercado algo m s transparente
559275 la sociedad rural acot no est para sacar y nombrar a los funcionarios de agricultura tampoco para dictar las pol ticas agropecuarias como hicieron en otros tiempos como dice miguens esas s eran pol ticas arbitrarias
559276 los argentinos hoy tenemos un gobierno que gobierna un gobierno que mantiene una visi n de desarrollo productivo integral y distribuci n de la riqueza que deja de lado el ego smo un gobierno que pone rumbo hacia una pol tica agropecuaria para todos los argentinos y no para un sector en particular
559277 una vez m s desde la sociedad rural se insiste en la voracidad de los grandes productores que s lo buscan exportar a toda costa sin ning n control del estado porque no les importa el abastecimiento interno
559278 tampoco quieren hacerse cargo de la crisis alimentaria mundial y de la mesa de los argentinos lo nico que les importa es la oportunidad de obtener ganancias a costa del hambre de los que no pueden pagar lo que ellos desean ganar
559279 deben saber los ruralistas de palermo que mientras m s produzcan y m s declaren m s exportar n
559280 no pueden expresarse a medias tintas la dirigencia de palermo confunde el cumplimiento de reglas con trabas controles con pol ticas arbitrarias siguen defendiendo la informalidad en el campo y los mecanismos de elusi n fiscal
559281 ya es hora de que la sociedad rural indic deje de apoyarse en las leyes que dise mart nez de hoz para salvaguardar la especulaci n de las grandes exportadoras de cereales cuestionan la resoluci n 543 de la oncca porque ha sido la nica herramienta efectiva con la que pudimos r pidamente combatir la elusi n fiscal que la ley de granos les permite
559282 es hora de cambios y los ruralistas de palermo deben comprender que el pago de los derechos de exportaci n ya no puede ser un componente m s de la especulaci n en el comercio de granos cereales y oleaginosas una cosa son los mercados a futuro y otra cosa es un estado pavo que mira como los exportadores eluden las retenciones
559283 necesitamos un comercio m s transparente en beneficio de todos y no para picard a de unos pocos todas las exportaciones tributan sobre el precio y al nivel de retenciones que est vigente al momento de registrar las operaciones en la aduana si quieren congelar el precio y el nivel de retenciones al tiempo que presentan los roe verde pues entonces que cumplan con sus obligaciones fiscales en ese momento
559284 necesitamos un mercado de granos transparente l stima que los ruralistas de palermo no tienen en cuenta qu algunos de sus socios exportaron en 2007 el 90 de su producci n a para sos fiscales como m naco islas v rgenes e islas caim n
559285 sin embargo el estado cumple con su deber la aduana estableci que el 86 del aceite de soja a granel tambi n fue facturado a para sos fiscales y el 80 de las exportaciones de harina de soja tuvieron estos mismos destinos
559286 la oncca es un engranaje dentro de la estructura fiscalizadora del estado la sociedad rural no deber a molestarle que esta oficina la aduana o la afip hagan su trabajo en la b squeda de la equidad y la transparencia comercial agropecuaria
559287 en ning n pa s del mundo se permite el nivel de connivencia que pretende recuperar la sociedad rural en aquellas instituciones que deben controlarla
559288 the prime minister singh was relatively frank in expressing his concerns about recent incidents which have had an impact on the relationship and the prospects of the dialogue
559289 the recent events had made that difficult and these events had to be addressed
559290 every attempt would be made to maintain it in future
559291 it was a candid and open conversation between two people who wanted to see a way forward in the situation
559292 there was a detailed exchange of views on how we could deal with these recent events and how we could move this relationship forward
559293 saarc is an association that provides an opportunity for its eight member states to walk the path of progress together to overcome developmental challenges facing the region together and to seize the opportunities that a rapidly globalising world offers
559294 as the largest country in saarc india will contribute to regional prosperity in a non reciprocal asymmetric manner
559295 rapid economic growth is the essential first step to enable the generation of resources and surpluses that can be used for social and economic development having said this it is equally essential for economic growth to be inclusive it is incumbent on all of us to create the conditions for such growth and all round development
559296 web 2 oh man how are we supposed to integrate all this stuff into our online communications
559297 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
559298 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
559299 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
559300 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
559301 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
559302 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
559303 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
559304 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
559305 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
559306 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
559307 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
559308 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
559309 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
559310 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
559311 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
559312 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
559313 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
559314 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
559315 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
559316 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
559317 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

559352 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
559353 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
559354 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
559355 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
559356 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
559357 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
559358 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
559359 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
559360 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
559361 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
559362 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
559363 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
559364 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
559365 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
559366 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
559367 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
559368 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
559369 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
559370 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
559371 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
559372 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
559373 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
559374 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
559375 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
559376 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

559389 the number of helicopters provided to the unamid remains the same zero
559390 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
559391 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
559392 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
559393 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

559395 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
559396 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
559397 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
559398 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
559399 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
559400 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight

559412 hes one of the best young players in all of baseball theres no question about that
559413 i saw him at the all star game had a chance to meet him a very pleasant young man very impressive i like him a lot because hes a two way player a great third baseman and a very very good offensive player hes a total package
559414 i would have loved to stay out there a little longer and try to find my way out of that last inning but its my own fault for not keep my pitch total down and getting into too many jams
559415 we have 11 hits three runs they have 11 hits nine runs thats not good

559418 i just wanted to try it one more time to convince myself thats what needs to get done
559419 sometimes as a starter those at bats can kind of be the ones that make or break the game
559420 i wanted to make tough pitches and hopefully make something good happen

559422 unfortunately i made one too many and its kind of a tough one to swallow

559467 yukyu aku lelah dan haus seharusnya dari awal aku tidak melempar dadu sialan itu keberuntungan apanya aku selalu saja sial
559468 sudah kuduga masa lalu mu itu sangat sangat menarik sama seperti masa lalu temanmu yang kecil
559469 kau tidak perlu melempar dadu lagi aku akan memenangkan mu
559470 cermin ini akan menampilkan sesuatu di dunia ini yang kau takuti
559471 ah ini sungguh menarik karena sebenarnya dia adalah bagian dari masa lalumu yang akan menjadi bagian dari masa depanmu
559472 baiklah baiklah kalian sudah menyelesaikan permainan ini dengan cara yang menarik
559473 kau sebagai juara pertama kau berhak memberikan hukuman apa saja kepada si juara terakhir ini
559474 aku yang membiarkan dia menang malah aku sengaja membuatnya menang
559475 begini gini aku tau semua tentang kalian oho oho oho
559476 maafkan aku bila aku sering punya salah bouras aku selalu menyusahkan mu
559477 annisete kumohon jangan bunuh appril sekarang aku hanya ingin menghabiskan waktu lebih lama lagi bersama appril
559478 menjadi budak ku dan menuruti semua kata kataku selama ia masih bersamaku
559479 begitu ya siapa tau permainan tadi sebenarnya hanyalah ilusi kita belaka dan sekarang kita sedang bermimpi berarti hukuman itu juga
559480 sebenarnya aku sedikit bingung kau bisa saja kan membunuh appril saat itu kau tinggal menghukum appril dengan bilang kalau appril mati saja
559481 kau sendiri apa kau tidak punya kemurnian hati membawa kami ke negri barat
559482 aku bukankah itu mau mu bukankah kau bilang kalau kau ingin tinggal di negri barat
559483 tapi yang jelas aku tidak akan mengambil pilihan itu aku sama sekali tidak membencimu lho
559484 ya terserah apa kataku kedudukanmu sebagai budak ku tidak akan pernah bisa berubah
559485 bailah apa kau mau kembali ke jalan awal kembali ke kota vyune atau kita meneruskan perjalanan ke barat karena sangat sulit menemukan tempat yang jauh di bumi inin
559486 ah kira kira kota aneh apa lagi ya yang ada di depan sana
559487 kita butuh bahan makanan bahan makanan kita dan juga persediaan air minum makin menipis
559488 tidak bisa kita harus mendapatkannya disini kota selanjutnya akan berjarak ratusan mil dan membutuhkan lima hari perjalanan
559489 entahlah aku hanya tau kalau kota ini dihuni oleh orang orang tanpa masa lalu
559490 ya beberapa hari lalu saya memikirkan cara untuk mengalahkan negri barat musuh terbesar negri timur kita tidak memiliki apa apa kecuali mulut kita yang menganga besar saat melihat kehebatan senjata negri barat tapi takdir telah merubah kita kini saya telah menemukan sesuatu yang patut di takuti oleh negri barat
559491 akulah si pemegang masa lalu dan tadi adalah sebagian dari masa lalumu
559492 masa lalu ku berarti orang yang berpidato tadi adalah bagian dari masa laluku dia siapa
559493 masa depanmu kau harus menyerahkan masa depanmu karena aku hidup melalui masa depan yang di berikan manusia macam kau manusia yang tanpa masa lalu dan putus asa menghadapi masa depan yang akan datang
559494 tentu saja tetapi orang yang menjual masa lalunya tidak akan mendapatkan keuntungan apapun dan dia akan hidup dalam kebingungan
559495 aku tidak peduli dengan akibatnya aku mau ingatan masa laluku di ambil sekarang
559496 baiklah kalau itu maumu apa kau sudah siap sekarang karena prosesnya akan sedikit menyakitkan
559497 apa kau tau seberapa pentingnya masa lalu aku sangat menginginkan masa lalu tetapi kau ingin membuangnya begitu saja jangan bodoh aku memang tidak tau seburuk apa masa lalumu dulu tetapi setidaknya kau memiliki kisah yang bisa kau kenang
559498 aku hanya tidak ingin kau sepertiku seperti yang memori bilang hidup dalam kebingungan
559499 kenapa kau tidak menukarkan masa depanmu dengan masa lalumu bukankah masa depanmu akan menyakitkan kau akan meledak
559500 kau ini bicara apa kan aku sudah bilang kalau aku ingin kita berteman seperti bouras dan nea
559501 lalu kenapa kau tadi terdiam saat memori menawarkan nya apa kau mempertimbangkannya
559502 aku hanya berpikir kalau baju yang dipakai memori sangat tidak cocok
559503 lagipula kalau melihat bouras yang semangat mencari bahan makanan untuk kita mengetahui kalau masih ada satu orang di dunia ini yang masih semangat untuk membantu masa depan kita aku jadi tidak sabar untuk melihat masa depan apa yang akan kujalani nanti
559504 ya bisa dibilang begitu namanya memori ia akan mendatangi orang orang yang tidak memiliki masa lalu dan akan memunculkan sedikit tentang masa lalunya kemudian dia akan memberikan tawaarannya
559505 dengan memberikan masa depannya ia akan mendapatkan masa lalunya begitukah
559506 karena masa lalu tetap saja masa lalu kau pernah melewatinya hanya saja kau tidak ingat apa itu
559507 karena kuyakin kau tau semua masa laluku maukah suatu saatnya nanti kau ceritakan padaku
559508 aku tidak biasa membawa sesuatu yang berat cepat bawakan atau kusuruh badanmu untuk melakukan hal yang aneh aneh
559509 aku harap kau benar karena laki laki itu tidak terlihat seperti itu
559510 apa kau tau nama orang itu dialah yang namanya bouras
559511 aku dengar tasnya yang besar itu isinya peralatannya pokoknya aku mau bonekaaa
559512 mmng anak saya ingin dibuatkan boneka apa sempat anda membuatnya
559513 bisakah ng kau menjaga anakku sebentar aku ingin membeli buah dan sayuran di pasar yang tidak jauh dari sini sebentar
559514 tentu saja tidak kalau ia burung sungguhan pasti aku sudah penuh dengan kotorannya dari tadi ini burung rakitan
559515 aku tidak tau doris dia sudah bersamaku sejak umurku masih 8 tahun tiba tiba saja yukyu sudah hinggap dipundakku
559516 ng begini saat aku berumur 8 tahun kaulah yang pertama kali menemukanku di taman kota saat hujan aku menangis namun orang orang yang ada disekelilingku tidak ada yang peduli hanya kau yang mempersilahkan aku masuk ketokomu ini
559517 ya ya aku tau itu aku juga yang memberikanmu nama appril karena saat itu sedang bulan appril
559518 kenapa paman mau padahal yang lainnya tidak ada yang peduli
559519 mmm kenapa ya kau tiba tiba bertanya seperti itu malah membuatku bingung kalau bertanya kenapa akupun juga tidak tahu
559520 sudah tidak usah dipikirkan mau roti madu dan susu hangat
559521 hei paman kau terlalu baik itulah sebabnya aku selalu menolak ajakanmu untuk tinggal dirumah paman kalu kau mau tahu alasannya
559522 sudahlah mau tidak tawaranku hanya berlaku sampai tiga kali saja nih
559523 mereka menyerang secara tiba tiba diperbatasan negri kita siapkan pasaukan sekarang
559524 jadikan situasi ini untuk menjadi keadan darurat bagi seluruh warga
559525 benthill tentang pembicaraan kita tadi kurasa sudah saatnya tiba bagi mereka untuk bergerak
559526 tapi keadaaanya sekarang benar benar terdesak benthill jangan terlalu melindungi mereka kau tau kalau mereka akan berakhir seperti ini
559527 agusta mereka bisa tidak berakhir seperti itu kalau kau tahu
559528 tapi sekarang jutaan nyawa orangpun bergantung pada mereka kau tau kan betapa kuatnya pasukan negri barat dengan daerah kita yang kecil dan pasukan kita yang lemah dan sedikit aku rasa kita tidak akan berhasil menghadapi mereka
559529 agusta benar benthill kita harus cepat bertindak negri barat pasti tidak akan membutuhkan waktu yang lama untuk menghabisi kita
559530 panggil aku bouras saja kau kan sudah 7 tahun kenal denganku
559531 tentang pertanyaan tadi siang sebenarnya bukan itu pertanyaan intinya ada hal lain yang ingin kutanyakan
559532 sudah langsung ke intinya saja kau kan tau aku tidak suka orang yang berbasa basi
559533 apa aku punya ibu kalau aku punya pasti ibuku akan mencariku kan
559534 begitu ya jadi kau menganggap kalau kau tidak punya ibu itu mana mungkin
559535 aku juga sempat berpikir seperti itu hanya saja aku hidup seperti tidak memiliki ibu sejak lahir kau kan tau kalau hari pertamaku didunia ini adalah saat aku ditemukanmu di taman kota hanya sejauh itu yang aku ingat
559536 mungkin saja ibumu tidak peduli padamu atau sibuk atau apalah
559537 iya tapi kenapa kenapa ibuku sibuk kenapa ibuku tidak peduli padaku
559538 bouras aku anak yang baik kan kau saja ingin aku tinggal dirumahmu padahal kau tidak melahirkanku tapi kenapa ibuku tidak mau aku tinggal bersmanya
559539 sudah malam ini kau tidur bersamaku karena kamar tamunya belum kusiapkan oke
559540 tidak apa aku kan sudah bilang kalau kau mungkin tidak bisa menjawabnya maaf karena tadi nada bicaraku tinggi
559541 pertanyaan kenapa itu selalu berjawaban tidak berujung maka dari itu kau lebih baik melanjutkan hidupmu daripada menunggu jawaban yang tidak berujung itu
559542 seumur hidupku aku belum pernah memanggil ayah atau ibu itu satu satunya kata yang belum pernah kuucapkan
559543 boleh asal sekali saja ya aku kan belum terpikirkan untuk punya anak
559544 jelas namun bagi appril ciap ciap yukyu adalah sebuah cerita yang sangat menarik
559545 kali ini aku yang akan bicara bukan bouras dan juga bukan kau appril
559546 jadi appril maksud kedatanganku saat ini adalah untuk menjelaskan sesuatu padamu yang sangat penting menyangkut hidup matimu
559547 mungkin kau agak kaget dengan kejadian yang kau alami tadi dan akan kau hadapi dating secara tiba tiba tapi itulah kenyataannya
559548 annisete gadis yang tadi menyerangmu adalah seorang yang spesial sepertimu
559549 ya biar kujelaskan dari awal dulu saat timur dan barat masih berperang kita dari daerah timur benar benar terdesak tentara timur banyak yang berguguran dan politik didaerah timurpun juga hancur berantakan
559550 baiklah aku dan ke 2 temanku adalah seorang ilmuwan dan kami menemukan bahan peledak lyddite yang sangat dasyat daya ledaknya yang kemungkinanya dapat menghancurkan daerah barat namun masalah yang kami punya adalah bahan peledak itu hanya akan aktif bila didalam sel organ tubuh manusia
559551 lalu kami memilih bayi wyvern wyvern adalah sebuah kemampuan khusus contoh kecilnya seperti bisa mengeluarkan api seperti yang kau lihat tadi kami memilih bayi wyvern karena kami pikir bayi itu adalah spesial dan pasti akan menghasilkan ledakan yang sempurna tapi kami sama sekali menyadari kelemahan lyddite kami baru menyadari kelemahan itu saat kami sudah memasukan lyddite kedalam tubuh bayi bayi itu hanya satu kelemahanya lyddite itu akan meledak saat organ organ tubuhnya berumur 16 tahun
559552 seperti yang kubilang diawal kau adalah spesial kau spesial karena kau dan annisete adalah bayi wyvern yang kami pilih untuk
559553 teriak appril sambil menarik kerah baju benthill kencang tetapi untuk kesekian kalinya kepala appril merasakan sakit
559554 itu tidak akan terjadi kalau salah satu dari kalian ada yang mati
559555 siapa kau tiba tiba saja aku diberitahu secara mendadak seperti ini aku tidak mengerti bagaimana menghadapinya meledak
559556 dan kau memang tidak akan pernah mengerti kalau aku tidak memberitahukanmu secara tiba tiba appril kumohon turuti saja kata kataku ini
559557 tidak ada waktu untuk itu appril negri barat menyerang kita pagi ini tiba tiba dan parlemen ingin kau dan annisete membantu mereka untuk menyerang negri barat
559558 aku tidak berniat untuk membunuhmu dasar pembuat boneka tidak berguna aku hanya ingin mengambil burung rakitku
559559 apa kau bilang dia selalu menemaniku setiap saat tau walaupun kadang kadang ia lama tidak kembali
559560 mung kin itu milik kita berdua selama ia tidak bersamaku mungkin ia bersamamu begitu juga sebaliknya
559561 cih aku tidak sudi yukyu ku ini menjadi milik berdua denganmu
559562 ya aku tau sejak lama tapi tadi aku mendengarnya lagi saat menguping pembicaraanmu
559563 lalu kenapa kau tidak mebunuhku sekarang dengan keadaanku yang seperti ini yang tidak tau apa apa kurasa akan mudah bagimu untuk membunuhku
559564 aku inig berpikir terlebih dahulu apakah satu nyawaku ini berarti jika aku hidup tetapi jutaan nyawa melayang karena aku salah pilih
559565 tidak ada yang boleh menyentuh appril selain diriku apalagi kalian tangan dan bernapas busuk
559566 sakit bukan itu yang akan kau dapatkan jika kau tidak menjawb pertanyaanku
559567 tentu saja untuk mengambil para lyddite ini mereka berguna bagi negara
559568 benthill tidak akan memberikan lydditenya tanpa dipaksa dan inilah hasil dari keangkuhannya
559569 ya aku tau dia memang tidak berguna bagi kita yang ada disini tetapi dia masih berguna untuk mereka yang ada diluarsana
559570 mau apa kau benthill kau sudah tua tidak mungkin bisa melakukannya lagi
559571 jadi ini kekuatan memanipulasi manusia milikmu kau tidak akan bisa mengontrolku
559572 aku tidak berniat untuk memanipulasimu mahluk kotor aku beniat untunk membunuhmu
559573 coba saja kalau kau bisa kau bahkan tidak akan bisa menyentuhku
559574 ternyata kau lupa aku dapat memanipulasi manusia bukan hanya dengan kontak mata namun dengan memikirkan orang tersebutpun aku dapa memanipulasinya
559575 lalu mau apa kau sekarang mencoba untuk membunuhku kau yang bilang kan kalau aku masih berguna diluar sana
559576 kenapa kau menghalangiku aku mengambil mereka untuk keperluan orang banyak kan
559577 mereka punya pilihan dan kau mengambil mereka bukan untuk keperluan orang banyak tapi untuk kekuasaan yang kau idam idamkan
559578 kau terlalu baik untuk mereka bethill padalah kau tau akhirnya akan menjadi apa
559579 sudah tidak ada waktu bagi kita untuk mengobrol lebih lama lagi
559580 aku tidak akan membiarkna orang seperti kau hidup lebih lama lagi disini orang yang hidup diatas penderitaan orang lain
559581 kau tidak bisa membunuhku kalau kau membunuhku pasti parlemen akan menghukummu dengan hukuman yang paling berat dan kau akan menyesal telah membunuhku
559582 aku tidak bilang kalu kau akan mati sendirian aku akan membuat tempat ini hancur tanpa sisa
559583 apa maksudmu kau tidak punya kekuatan untuk membuat tempat ini seperti yang kau bilang tadi
559584 aku memang tidak punya tapi tombol yang ada disampingmu punya itu
559585 jadi bouras maukah kau menjelaskan apa sebenarnya yang terjadi tadi
559586 glodi adalah ketua parlemen ia sangat terobsesi oleh kekuasaan dan uang ia orang yang harus mendapatkan sesuatu yang diinginkannya bagaimanapun caranya walaupun ia harus mengorbankan nyawa orang
559587 dan benthill tau benar dengan sikap glodi yang itu saat glodi bilang gunakan kalian untuk melawan negri barat benthill menyadari kalau ada niat dibalik itu semua dia ingin menggunakan kalian untuk mencari kekuasaan dan harta
559588 lalu apa yang dilakukan ayah tadi kenapa dia tidak langsung membunuh glodi tadi dia bisa melakukannya kalu ia mau
559589 tidak akan membahayakan bagi kita untuk bersamanya wajah benthill sudah dikenali oleh seluruh penjuru negri dan akan membahayakan kita semua kita bisa tertangkap
559590 kita akan pergi pergi ketempat yang jauh dari sini dan negri barat
559591 kita tidak ada waktu untuk berdiam diri disini lebih lama lagi polisi akan segera datang dan akan mencari kita ayo cepat
559592 kau gila aku tidak akan meninggalkan ayahku dan maid sendirian terbakar habis disana
559593 ayahmu mengingnkan kau untuk menjauh darisini dia berbuat seperti itu untuk menyelamatkanmu kalau kau kesana artinya perjuangan ayahmu sia sia
559594 appril lyddite yang ada didalam diri kalian adalah kekutan yang dapat menghancurkan setengah dari bumi dan kalian adalah ancaman terbesar bagi negri barat tetapi glodi menyadari potensi kalian ia ingin menguasai negeri barat tengah selatan dan utara singkatnya ia ingin menguasai dunia dengan kekuatan yang dimiliki kalian
559595 perlu kau ketahui appril mungkin orang biasa seperti aku tidak akan pernah tahan dengan daya ledakan lyddite kami akan musnah kalau ternanya tetapi kalian sampai kapanpun kalian akan tetap bertahan dan tidak akan mati hanya karena lyddite ataupun ledakannya
559596 ya kalian hanya bisa sekali meledak tetapi kalau kau dapat mengontrol kekuatan lyddite dengan baik kau bisa berkali kali meledak walupun daya ledakannya lebih sedikt daripada yang sekali itu tetapi dampaknya sama buruknya
559597 tetapi bouras apa maksudnya dengan perkataan benthill kalau salah satu dari aku dan annisete mati maka kami tidak akan meledak
559598 lyddite adalah sebuah cairan yang aktif bila terdapat lyddite yang lain untu lebih jelasnya kalian ini seperti lampu dan saklar kalian ini saling mengaktifkan lyddite yang ada di dalam diri kalian lampu tidak akan myala kalau tidak ada saklar dan saklar tidak akan berfungsi kalau tidak ada lampu begitulah jelasnya sama seperti kalian kalau salah satu diantara kalian ada yang mati maka lyddite kalian tidak berfungsi
559599 perlu kalian ketahui yang berhak membunuh kalian adalah kalian berdua sendiri karena kalau sampai orang lain dapat membunuh kalian maka sama juga kalian meledakan diri dengan percuma
559600 benthill menyuruh ku untuk melakukan tugas terakhirku yaiutu membawa kalian pergi jauh darisini aku juga tidak tau dengan pastinya kemana tempat jauh tersebut karena benthill sama sekali tidak menyebutkan nama tempat itu dia hanya bilang ketempat yang jauh dan selama perjalanan kalian harus memikirkan jawaban dari tiga piliihan
559601 pertama kalian akan menentukan diantara kalian yang mati dan lydite kalianpun tidak akan berfungsi namun hasilnya negara timur tidak akan aman lagi karena pastinya negri barat akan membuat negri timur habis
559602 kedua kalian akan oergi ke negri barat dan meledakan diri kalian disana maka negri timur akan selamat namun negri barat akan habis seketika
559603 ketiga kalian akan menyerahkan diri kalian ke salah satu sisi yang kalian anggap benar dan meledakan diri kalian sedikit sedikit untuk membantu mereka namun hasilnya dunia ini tidak akan pernah aman karena kalian
559604 tidak akan bisa bagaimanapun juga sudah menjadi sebuah kepastian diri kalian meledak
559605 ya setelah aku membunuhmu aku akan hidup bahagia di negri barat
559606 bisa bisanya kau bilang seperti itu padahal tadi kau bilang kalau kau msih memikirkan nasib rakyat negri timur
559607 dasar kau tidak punya perasaan dengan enaknya kau ingin membunuhku dan membiarkan rakyat dinegeri timur terlantar begitu saja nantinya bahkan ayahmu meninggal saja kau tidak menangis
559608 dasar sok tau aku memang tidak peduli dengan negri timur begitu juga dengan warga timur sendiri saat mereka tau kalau kau adalah seorang lyddite maka kau tidak akan pernah diterima
559609 satu lagi aku tidak menangis karena ayahku meninggal bukan karena aku tidak punya perasaan tapi memang karena aku bukan anak kandungnya mengerti kau pembuat boneka yang sok tau dan bodoh
559610 sudahlah bukan saatnya kalian untuk berantam di hari yang melelahkan ini l ebih baik kalian tidur dan mempersiapkan stamina kalian utuk besok
559611 lebih cepat lebih baik dan kita tidak boleh menunda waktu lebih lama lagi besok kita harus meninggalkan kota ini dengan jalan kaki karena kalu kita memakai kendaraan kita akan dicurigai karena sekarang kota dalam kondisi darurat pasti semua kendaraan yang melintas akan diperiksa
559612 seperti yang aku sudah bilang sudah sudah aku siap menampung semua pertanyaanmu appril
559613 begini kenapa aku merasa kalu kau sangat tau sifat glodi
559614 nossa tenho que lembrar disso amanha pra colocar no blog

559623 developing a good memory is one of the most useful social and business skills a person can master
559624 jangan panggil aku dengan ann panggil aku dengan jelas annisete kalau perlu kau memanggil nama panjangku june annisete
559625 wyvernmu itu sebenarnya sedikit unik wyvernmu itu bersifat seperti spons kau menyerap semua wyvern yang ada disampingmu dan menyimpannya didalam tubuhmu saat kau melawan annisete waktu itu kau bisa mengeluarkan api karena kau menyerap wyvern annisete
559626 lyddite itu akan lebih cepat meledak apabila terangsang dengan kekuatan yang besar jadi kalau terlalu banyak menggunakan wyvernmu kau sama saja merangsang lyddite itu untuk meledak
559627 tetapi kau bisa mempelajari bagaimana mengontrol wyvern dan lyddite yang ada didalam tubuhmu kok
559628 maaf aku kira kalian adalah tentara negri barat aku lihat dari api unggun kalian kami disuruh berjaga jaga karena informasi yang ada negeri barat menuju kesini
559629 penjagaan kota sedang sangat ketat dan jarang memberikan izin masuk kekota bahkan mungkin juga tidak menerima pengunjung untuk saat saat ini sampai keadaan aman
559630 sudah lebih baik kalian tidur dulu ini kan sudah malam juga
559631 kau ikutlah para saga mencari mereka lalu kau tau apa selanjutnya yang harus dilakukan
559632 maaf ya kalau anak ini bertingkah atau menawarkan kalian barang barang aneh jangan pernah menganggap barang dagangannya barangnya benar benar teruji aneh
559633 tapi nampaknya ia masih belum bisa memaafkanku karena pilihan yang aku pilih ya
559634 nea tidak memafkanmu karena selama 15 tahun ini kau tidak kembali kesini dan tidak berusaha kan
559635 maafkan aku bouras sikap keras kepala wanita kau tau itu
559636 bouras menatap annisete yang membalas tatapannya acuh tak acuh kalau begitu lakukan jangan sampai kau menunggu kesempatan kedua yang jarang ada
559637 tentu saja ia berugas dibarisan paling depan dan mendapat bintang penghargaan semenjak itulah impiannya sedikit demi sedikit mulai tercipta beberapa tahun kemudian ia pergi atas izin kepala desa langsung saat itu mereka sangat senang akhirnya ada juga orang desa kecil seperti kami yang bisa masuk ke parlemen dan tentu saja glodi akhirnya pergi dan aku masih belum bisa berkembang aku masih saja menjadi bouras yang tidak bisa apa apa
559638 ah kenapa aku sampai lupa untuk membeli paprika huh aku harus balik kesana lagi
559639 apa kau pikir orang yang tidak mengizinkan kita untuk keluar dari sini hanya untuk membeli paprika akan membolehkan untuk pergi ke jalan yang tidak akan menemukan ujung
559640 darimana kau tau itu kan tulisan dari suku as mereka dulu yang membuat hutan pelindung ini karena dulu mereka ikut andil dalam pembuatan desa ini
559641 apa yang lucu aku kira sesuatu itu bisa apa saja
559642 padahal dari luar gedung ini rasanya tidak setinggi tangga ini
559643 tadi saat dihutan pohon yang menjaga hutan bilang kalu aku ini tidak cantik aku jadi ragu apa aku ini benar benar cantik atau tidak
559644 pohon harapan bisa memberi jawaban manusia hanya dalam lima tahun sekali namun pohon harapan juga memiliki nyawa seperti pohon pohon lainnya ruuna nyawanya akan habis jika ia sudah menjawab dan memberikan harapan kepada lima pertanyaan manusia itulah nyawanya dan pertanyaanmu adalah pertanyaan yang terakhir
559645 karena setelah harapan lama itu mati akan tumbuh harapan harapan baru lagi ruuna ingat itu harapan tidak pernah mati
559646 karena setelah harapan lama itu mati akan tumbuh harapan harapan baru lagi
559647 saat di pohon harapan maaf ya karena akhirnya aku hanya menanyakan hal bodoh seperti itu
559648 saat dihutan kau bilang banyak hal yang tidak kutehaui seperti apa kumohon hanya untuk terakhir kalinya aku ingin tau
559649 oh ya nama gadis ini june annisete kalau kau masih penasaran kenapa wajahnya tidak asing lagi untukmu
559650 aku tidak tau apa apa tapi yang jelas bunga berwarna ungu itu di casuarina artinya adalah harapan lambang kota ini
559651 baguslah tapi sebenarnya apa yang kau ingin tanyakan kepada pohon harapan
559652 oh tidak appril kau sudah sedikit menjadi annisete pendiam yang tidak banyak bicara
559653 ya kau bilang hal seperti itu memang harapan seperti apa
559654 walah sepertinya ku salah paham ya appril dulu aku dan nea pacaran lho

559852 im a little disappointed about that he two upped me he couldnt go with no 98
559853 he cant just seem to relax when he gets in the game
559854 if i felt he wasnt trying to help himself i dont think i would have continued to try to make it work
559855 but he was in there working at it and we have two hitting coaches working with him practice stuff has been good unfortunately its not the same as the game
559856 we need to know who this was and why they did it
559857 i have no grudge with anyone i just want justice for my wife and family
559858 this fire has absolutely devastated this family who have now not only lost their mother and grandmother but their little girl too

559873 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for
559874 its weird because most weeks on tour theres probably 20 guys or 10 guys who can win on the last day
559875 but parkers never won before so you never know he might shoot a couple over and around this golf course anything can happen you can hit good shots and get a bad bounce and be really in trouble
559876 it was my first time having a lead and i didnt really approach it the right way and learned a lot from it
559877 that one i looked past the finish line too early and this one im looking forward to the first shot on the first hole tomorrow and thats as far as im going to go
559878 i thought it was going to be the worst birthday ever after the first three holes
559879 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry

559885 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep

559891 even though its going to be very useful to have better more reliable figures its also disappointing and very sad that we found out that the epidemic has been worse than we thought for the last 17 years
559892 its like shifting from standard view to wide screen high definition television
559893 in fact the separate historical trends analyses suggested the number of new infections was never as low as 40 000
559894 the fact remains that there are far too many people becoming infected in the united states every year therefore these findings should be a wake up call that the epidemic in the united states is far from over
559895 until you engage the department of justice on this issue as part of an overall comprehensive strategy youre going to miss a major source of infection for the african american community that then goes on to infect women and children
559896 i come to the match not 100 per cent physically or mentally
559897 but its a important match so i still try my best

559899 the ipod name cannot be synced you do no have enough access privileges fo this operation
559900 and they are doing a terrorist act on this country with the high gas prices theyre about to wreck this economy not only our economy but the world economy
559901 the decisions did not get made that should have been they didnt get made in a timely fashion and the differences were argued out endlessly at the end of the day you have to hold the president responsible i dont think he realized the extent of the opposition within his own administration and the disloyalty
559902 if he had his time over he would not have advocated an invasion of iraq
559903 this is like talking to a psychotic streetperson stoked up on sterno
559904 in two or three months if this thing hasnt come to fruition and this level of violence is not under control i think its a responsibility of our government to determine is there a change of course we should take
559905 the only thing we didnt do was pull the trigger to the gun we were holding to her head
559906 its going to be tough when we close the doors
559907 people come in here all the time and say i remember buying gym clothes here or i bought my first bike here and i want to buy one for my kid
559908 i sometimes joke that id be more socially acceptable in the porn business than selling firearms
559909 i tell our guys if youre not comfortable dont sell it
559910 ive already isolated and picked those areas that are affected
559911 many homes and businesses did suffer significant damage and postponing taxes for people who need time to focus on recovery is one way the state can help taxpayers in counties where the governor has issued a disaster declaration

559914 trends in global terrorism implications for the united states it asserts that islamic radicalism rather than being in retreat has metastasized and spread across the globe
559915 i believe that secretary rumsfeld and others in the administration did not tell the american people the truth for fear of losing support for the war in iraq
559916 never put a period where god has put a comma
559917 its that thing where even though i know im being pandered to with packaging i have a vagina so i cant say no
559918 you meet a guy relinquish a tiny bit of control and the next thing you know youre eating a different part of the pig

559929 a future product transition that i cant discuss with you today
559930 i was so busy for the last five that i had no time to think about it but last night i had time to think about the incident which happened in front of my eyes i so felt threatened and scared i couldnt sleep the whole night
559931 i saw fire parts of vehicles and what not up in the air this is not an act any brave person can do if youve got animosity you fight on the war front and not with the people who are already injured and weak
559932 i was rushing people to the hospital on a trolley but as i was entering the hospital with the injured another bomb went off all those with me who were helping the injured were killed in that blast i saw a man burning he was crying for help but there was no one to help him because everybody was just too scared
559933 she and her cousin brother were playing in the ground she got injured but her brother unfortunately died she doesnt know that yet she fell unconscious so she doesnt know
559934 we are offering them psychiatric help weve got a child psychologist who gives them psychotherapy sessions daily we are planning the rehabilitation of all the children
559935 he stated when talking to investigators that his rent was due and he did not want to ask his parents for money so he felt that he had no options
559936 i couldnt believe it i mean who wouldve thought lightning would strike twice but it had
559937 all were concerned about right now is taking care of our residents getting them settled and making sure their needs are met
559938 the fact is weve got redistricting coming up in a few years
559939 and if the republicans lose the texas house of representatives because there are a handful of people mad at them and vote for the libertarians instead then we could be in big trouble at the federal level
559940 with control of the texas house in the balance of this election i wouldnt be surprised if republicans try any trick in the book to maintain their grasps of control
559941 its not always who has the best ideas but who do we need to push out of the way
559942 she was pretty direct she said that she had heard there were two or three state representative races that she had heard would be close because theres a democratic race
