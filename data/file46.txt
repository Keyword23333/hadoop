460022 john please lets get out of here get me out of here john goddamnit stop
460023 it shouldnt have been anyone you shouldnt have been forced
460024 youre the football quarterback youre at every rally im forced to attend i could hardly not watch you
460025 i dont hate you i thought i was a top i thought i could never want something like that to be on my knees to have to submit
460026 people usually find me arrogant or intimidating theyre not interested in playing with me
460027 i didnt ask where you live i just brought you home
460028 my parents wont notice if im home or not they dont care
460029 they wont like me no one likes me im bad with people
460030 im taking you as my sub if you would do me the honor
460031 yes youre my top now you have my freely given submission
460032 they wont care they never care about anything i do
460033 hi mom im going to spend the night at a friends a top i didnt mean to wake you his parents thought you should know yeah okay bye
460034 your mom understood you were staying with your top didnt she
460035 i never know what my parents understand except that they like arguing they wont let me go to college because then theyd only have jeannie to fight over they certainly wouldnt agree on something like letting me take someone into my bedroom for sex
460036 im really sorry about what happened tonight what they did to you was wrong what i did to you
460037 because if you really do mean that youre going to be my top id rather move on to enjoying that
460038 i eat a lot i just burn a lot of energy
460039 good im glad and now i want to see you come
460040 talk to me rodney tell me what youre thinking i want to know
460041 i thought id die tonight when your friends grabbed me and tied me up and now im a sub and the football star is on his knees in front of me not that im complaining but are you sure youre a top youre supposed to insist on coming first and be all dominant and controlling
460042 dont worry im definitely a top and mostly ill come first but i want to learn everything about you what turns you on what makes you come so hard you see stars what you look like when you scream
460043 i like you saying what youre going to do i like that a lot
460044 im going to do all of that and more youll learn all about submitting
460045 youre perfect so submissive letting me do what i want
460046 my parents are switches they fight all the time and ive always had to fight with both of them i never thought that i would enjoy submitting its not me
460047 just relax and enjoy you dont have to fight me
460048 you dont look hung like a horse big yes big but not absurdly huge so why do you feel hung like a horse
460049 god yes and i dont believe in religion so i dont say that lightly you can start moving now
460050 if thats what it takes to get you moving then yes
460051 did i mention im stubborn and determined too as well as argumentative and bad with people
460052 it was weird i thought they wouldnt let me theyre all bigger than me
460053 i wasnt thinking later i only knew mitch might hurt rodney
460054 you learned important things about yourself last night and the kind of top youll be
460055 protective and possessive youre very like me but you should have tried harder to take rodney out of the situation before you forced him into oral copulation
460056 thatll be twenty with the strap and i want the names of your friends
460057 yes all of them today they cant be allowed to treat another human being that way its wrong
460058 i was working on breakfast john get yourself and rodney some juice we have orange or cranberry
460059 get the cranberry juice out john are you allergic to anything else
460060 my own family drinks orange juice they dont see why they shouldnt have something they enjoy because i cant drink it
460061 its time for your discipline john do you want to watch rodney
460062 john needs to be disciplined for what he did last night and for what he failed to do you have the right to watch if you want he gets twenty strokes with the strap
460063 he should have made more of an effort to get you free and he shouldnt have abused you
460064 i liked it i never realized i could like being a sub
460065 i appreciate your honesty but that doesnt excuse what john did that shouldnt have been how you learned about your own sexuality
460066 i know johns given me the list of the other kids involved ill talk to their parents today and make sure that theyre disciplined you can go with me if you like
460067 you have to i have to see them at school if you get their parents to discipline them theyll make my life hell believe me id love to see them whipped raw but id like to avoid being stuffed in a locker every day for the rest of the school year
460068 they wont be that stupid theyll know the consequences if they take another step against you
460069 are you kidding have you met those kids they dont have three brain cells to rub together among the four of them
460070 you dont know what its like to be a sub in high school gil i know your father always taught you respect but a lot of the teenage tops are still figuring things out and they can be too dominant rodney may be right to be concerned
460071 i want you to wear it every day youre my sub and no one will touch you if youre wearing my jacket
460072 i take it i have your approval to ensure that the other kids are disciplined then
460073 um no no i dont need to see john disciplined you really dont need to discipline him
460074 rodney would you help me with the dishes i think we should talk about handling the sheppard men
460075 take it easy today rest spend some time with rodney i can tell that you and he have something special together its the first time youve really felt like a top isnt it
460076 i thought so im glad for the two of you this is a very important time in your lives youre truly figuring out your roles and youll need to help each other
460077 youre seventeen now john and a top whos taken responsibility for a sub i dont expect to have to do this again
460078 good adam and i will probably be gone most of the day
460079 gil and adam have left to go talk to the other parents adam gave me some ointment do you want me to put it on you
460080 i cant believe he disciplined you and you just accepted it
460081 of course they do only they argue over who should do it and then they argue over what it should be and then they usually both discipline me
460082 and you dont accept it because its so messed up
460083 why should i even they cant agree on what is right
460084 my dads have never been like that sometimes adam disagrees with gils decision and they go into the other room and discuss it but they always agree when they come back out sometimes gil changes the discipline and sometimes he doesnt
460085 i should probably go home get some clean clothes i have studying to do today
460086 ill take you in a bit we can study together
460087 i have to get good grades to get scholarships for college im going to study aeronautical engineering

460139 interesting that most of the hypocrisy comes from popular and attractive women
460140 love your site btw im so through with all that nasty perez like gossip based on nothing
460141 on december 1st of 1981 where were emmett and rosalie that night at dinner
460142 but i mean i like everybodys verse because i think that lupe killed it kanye killed it mine was more about style than how dope the rhyme was it was really my melody that i liked more than anything thats why my vocal approach was a little different from what you would hear me do i wanted to just do something different that would look different on me
460143 the concept is based on old 80s video game graphics playing behind us while were rhyming
460144 we just want to have fun with the project in a day and age where the record industry is what it is im lucky enough to be on a label that understands and theyll just let us have fun
460145 all the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
460146 we think that everyone nose in its current form already hits a certain demographic a certain way so i just wanted to go and do something different
460147 you dont really believe in the concept of personal space do you
460148 just for personal reasons and you know because its miley and theyre gonna do good were gonna do good too the audience is gonna vote so well see
460149 were not gonna see it until its live so i have no idea
460150 yeah i was surprised it got so big that we had to do it somewhere like this
460151 the tension is building up and people are getting nervous were gonna smoke the audience
460152 what do you expect i mean were real people i have nothing bad to say about anybody
460153 his two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story
460154 he was not drunk he was drinking hours and hours before

460160 interesting that most of the hypocrisy comes from popular and attractive women
460161 love your site btw im so through with all that nasty perez like gossip based on nothing
460162 something sexy and edgy something where i get to use a knife
460163 dealing with the press is something that youve gotta start getting used to
460164 and you know people want something to talk about so theyre going to have the two disney girls or three disney girls kind of feuding
460165 theres no feud theres nothing to feud about so why start a fight
460166 its something that we all have to live with and unfortunately it involves friends
460167 im not interested in being anybody but myself and im not here to replace anyone
460168 i think that shes a wonderful performer and of course its a compliment but i would like to take a different route
460169 i would love to step out of disney and maybe do a couple of roles maybe challenging roles and fun roles new things like that
460170 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
460171 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
460172 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music its sort of this big empowerment thing
460173 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre jelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
460174 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names
460175 we were down to finding nowhere and broken media and we all voted for broken media
460176 total teenage drama its like us making fun of girls because we say they are talking on their cell phones listening to the radio looking in the mirror and trying to fix their hair
460177 we thought we should make it about people who would say lol

460191 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
460192 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
460193 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
460194 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
460195 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
460196 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
460197 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
460198 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens
460199 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
460200 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
460201 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
460202 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
460203 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
460204 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
460205 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
460206 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
460207 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
460208 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
460209 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be

460223 ci sono grandi questioni che sono superiori anche a un grande evento come le olimpiadi e il sogno di una medaglia
460224 li possiamo infastidire il traffico mi ha un po frenato
460225 andiamo fortissimo siamo davanti a tutti ma non mi sento al sicuro questa comunque una grande giornata per la squadra abbiamo fatto le scelte giuste siamo molto soddisfatti
460226 oggi abbiamo iniziato con gomme morbide poi laumento della temperatura ci ha spinto a utilizzare pneumatici pi duri la macchina andata fortissimo e siamo in ottima posizione se pensiamo alla gara una doppietta sarebbe splendida ma di certo non mi sento al sicuro
460227 una doppietta sarebbe splendida la squadra lo merita cos come lo meritiamo noi piloti non il caso per di rilassarsi eccessivamente anche se siamo in unottima posizione
460228 le mclaren sono andate fortissimo ha detto noi ci siamo possiamo dare loro fastidio
460229 non sempre un grande cambiamento d i risultati sperati ha detto a volte invece pu bastare un piccolo elemento e questo riesce a fare unenorme differenza stiamo spingendo molto sul tasto dello sviluppo
460230 sono entrato in pista nel momento sbagliato ha detto cerano molte macchine lente difficile preparare le gomme in quelle condizioni per questo non sono riuscito a fare un gran giro come avevo fatto nelle prime due manche
460231 non siamo apparsi in gran forma fino a stamattina se per consideriamo i tempi ottenuti nel q1 e nel q2 possiamo dire che ci siamo anche noi
460232 fa parte dello sviluppo dice massa va un po meglio ma non ci sono miglioramenti di mezzo secondo non cos che funzionano le cose noi stiamo lavorando sodo e sono sicuro che spingeremo ancora di pi da qui alla fine della stagione

460410 youre the football quarterback youre at every rally im forced to attend i could hardly not watch you
460411 i dont hate you i thought i was a top i thought i could never want something like that to be on my knees to have to submit
460412 people usually find me arrogant or intimidating theyre not interested in playing with me
460413 i didnt ask where you live i just brought you home
460414 my parents wont notice if im home or not they dont care
460415 they wont like me no one likes me im bad with people
460416 im taking you as my sub if you would do me the honor
460417 yes youre my top now you have my freely given submission
460418 they wont care they never care about anything i do
460419 hi mom im going to spend the night at a friends a top i didnt mean to wake you his parents thought you should know yeah okay bye
460420 your mom understood you were staying with your top didnt she
460421 i never know what my parents understand except that they like arguing they wont let me go to college because then theyd only have jeannie to fight over they certainly wouldnt agree on something like letting me take someone into my bedroom for sex
460422 im really sorry about what happened tonight what they did to you was wrong what i did to you
460423 because if you really do mean that youre going to be my top id rather move on to enjoying that
460424 i eat a lot i just burn a lot of energy
460425 good im glad and now i want to see you come
460426 talk to me rodney tell me what youre thinking i want to know
460427 i thought id die tonight when your friends grabbed me and tied me up and now im a sub and the football star is on his knees in front of me not that im complaining but are you sure youre a top youre supposed to insist on coming first and be all dominant and controlling
460428 dont worry im definitely a top and mostly ill come first but i want to learn everything about you what turns you on what makes you come so hard you see stars what you look like when you scream
460429 i like you saying what youre going to do i like that a lot
460430 im going to do all of that and more youll learn all about submitting
460431 youre perfect so submissive letting me do what i want
460432 my parents are switches they fight all the time and ive always had to fight with both of them i never thought that i would enjoy submitting its not me
460433 just relax and enjoy you dont have to fight me
460434 you dont look hung like a horse big yes big but not absurdly huge so why do you feel hung like a horse
460435 god yes and i dont believe in religion so i dont say that lightly you can start moving now
460436 if thats what it takes to get you moving then yes
460437 did i mention im stubborn and determined too as well as argumentative and bad with people
460438 it was weird i thought they wouldnt let me theyre all bigger than me
460439 i wasnt thinking later i only knew mitch might hurt rodney
460440 you learned important things about yourself last night and the kind of top youll be
460441 protective and possessive youre very like me but you should have tried harder to take rodney out of the situation before you forced him into oral copulation
460442 thatll be twenty with the strap and i want the names of your friends
460443 yes all of them today they cant be allowed to treat another human being that way its wrong
460444 i was working on breakfast john get yourself and rodney some juice we have orange or cranberry
460445 get the cranberry juice out john are you allergic to anything else
460446 my own family drinks orange juice they dont see why they shouldnt have something they enjoy because i cant drink it
460447 its time for your discipline john do you want to watch rodney
460448 john needs to be disciplined for what he did last night and for what he failed to do you have the right to watch if you want he gets twenty strokes with the strap
460449 he should have made more of an effort to get you free and he shouldnt have abused you
460450 i liked it i never realized i could like being a sub
460451 i appreciate your honesty but that doesnt excuse what john did that shouldnt have been how you learned about your own sexuality
460452 i know johns given me the list of the other kids involved ill talk to their parents today and make sure that theyre disciplined you can go with me if you like
460453 you have to i have to see them at school if you get their parents to discipline them theyll make my life hell believe me id love to see them whipped raw but id like to avoid being stuffed in a locker every day for the rest of the school year
460454 they wont be that stupid theyll know the consequences if they take another step against you
460455 are you kidding have you met those kids they dont have three brain cells to rub together among the four of them
460456 you dont know what its like to be a sub in high school gil i know your father always taught you respect but a lot of the teenage tops are still figuring things out and they can be too dominant rodney may be right to be concerned
460457 i want you to wear it every day youre my sub and no one will touch you if youre wearing my jacket
460458 i take it i have your approval to ensure that the other kids are disciplined then
460459 um no no i dont need to see john disciplined you really dont need to discipline him
460460 rodney would you help me with the dishes i think we should talk about handling the sheppard men
460461 take it easy today rest spend some time with rodney i can tell that you and he have something special together its the first time youve really felt like a top isnt it
460462 i thought so im glad for the two of you this is a very important time in your lives youre truly figuring out your roles and youll need to help each other
460463 youre seventeen now john and a top whos taken responsibility for a sub i dont expect to have to do this again
460464 good adam and i will probably be gone most of the day
460465 gil and adam have left to go talk to the other parents adam gave me some ointment do you want me to put it on you
460466 i cant believe he disciplined you and you just accepted it
460467 of course they do only they argue over who should do it and then they argue over what it should be and then they usually both discipline me
460468 and you dont accept it because its so messed up
460469 why should i even they cant agree on what is right
460470 my dads have never been like that sometimes adam disagrees with gils decision and they go into the other room and discuss it but they always agree when they come back out sometimes gil changes the discipline and sometimes he doesnt
460471 i should probably go home get some clean clothes i have studying to do today
460472 ill take you in a bit we can study together
460473 i have to get good grades to get scholarships for college im going to study aeronautical engineering

460574 todays celebration provides us with an exceptional opportunity to reflect on what religion and the life of faith mean for us as followers of jesus
460575 today we are being taught both by st ignatius whose feast we joyfully celebrate and by the two men who after many years of formation and prayer will today pronounce their final vows in the society of jesus and whom we have come to esteem and cherish as our colleagues and brothers
460576 they represent a complete and full affirmation on my part that the society of jesus the jesuits is my home and community for now and for the rest of my life
460577 the vows also symbolize that the jesuits accept and welcome that decision that they take as much joy in receiving my life commitment to the jesuits as i do in making it
460578 i always say in hospital orientation the jesuits began out of an experience of being wounded st ignatius was wounded in a battle and it was his recovery that started his conversion experience he worked doing lots of simple tasks for lots of years he did a lot of work at hospitals and orderly work

460735 it was astonishing for me to learn that 33 of americas 4th graders cant read at the basic level
460736 what we are doing this weekend is collecting these school supplies as well as the books and cash donations at the gate
460737 and if you cant make it this weekend any ups store will collect donations from you as well anywhere across the country actually
460738 those dollars we raise are going to buy a book for a child
460739 every dollar donated will buy a book to give to one of these needy kids you can help put a book into the hand of a child and help to unlock so much potential for them i think it is the greatest gift you can give to a child the ability to read it ignites their passion for learning it ignites their imagination and all the things they can do from there are just incredible
460740 additionally we really want people to bring new childrens books so when the donations are presented later this fall that new reading corner can be put in place at the dc school selected
460741 we started this last year the turnout was amazing talking to the fans and parents and seeing how much it means to them was important some of their kids here in this area are the ones who will be receiving these donations and its going to be benefiting their kids so that opened my eyes to the need by just meeting some of those who would be receiving these supplies its right here its local and thats a big deal to everyone a lot of these kids are going to stay here they are going to grow up here get jobs here just to be able to be a part of that to make a difference means a lot to not only me but anyone that lives here
460742 like all the guys on the team we are very excited about what the first ladies are doing with this project we care about the kids in the community and anything that is donated whether its a dollar here or books anything to help the kids in the community is worthwhile i am excited that shari is involved with the program because i know i feel as well as the rest of the guys on the nationals feel the same way that we can reach out and be active in the community education is something that is so important to help give the kids a chance to be successful down the road
460743 i was i was very active both my parents were teachers so my mom always had a book in my hands i really didnt have a choice everyone busting out laughing but it was something i really enjoyed growing up and has stayed with me my entire life
460744 one of the important points to understand if funds are donated within a community right here in washington dc those funds toys supplies and books are going to stay in washington dc if someone in idaho donates to the ups store that money stays in that community to support that literacy program that is one of the big benefits of having a big corporate sponsorship like ups they have mall stores all over the nation we cant ask for more than that its one of the most wonderful things in the world so if i could ask the pubic for a favor please come out to see the nationals play baseball this weekend bring us a book school supplies something we can use and please visit ups stores and make your donations there help out the communities in which you live in that is what this is all about we have changed our focus a little bit in the toys for tots foundation we are focused now a little more on literacy in partnership with the ups store but a lot of folks dont know this but toys for tots has been giving away books for quite some time we are very passionate about this
460745 we ended up with 13 bins of school supplies last year we really want to beat that goal this year and we want to bring in a lot more school supplies last year was incredible but we just want to top that mark last year was the first year there are more fans coming to the games now and with partnering with everyone here we should have a good turnout i dont have a specific goal because i have no clue how much we are going to get so just as much as possible hopefully our involvement nationals players amp family influences others to do the same and get their families involved this strengthens our bond and everybody should do their part to make a difference
460746 if you cant make it to the games this weekend you can also go to www toysfortotsliteracy org and learn more about the foundation as well as make a donation online

460762 the team has done a fantastic job of continually improving the car over the past few weeks so im really proud of what weve achieved today its great to have locked out the front row with heikki weve been threatening to do it for a number of races so to achieve it at a track where its tricky to pass is really satisfying theres a great harmony within the team at the moment and we really deserved this i couldnt ask to be in a better position weve both got good strategies for tomorrow and well be challenging for the win
460763 it was difficult to choose the right tyre for the final session and i felt i could have done a slightly faster lap in q3 but i was a little cautious in turn two still weve found a great direction with the car and ive got a great opportunity to win the race tomorrow its fantastic to be starting on the front row alongside lewis i hope that starting on the dirty side of the track wont be a disadvantage and i fully expect us to look out for each other in the first corner tomorrow this result really repays the team for all its efforts over the past few months

460843 that was a very good qualifying session for me and im obviously delighted we made a good start in first practice yesterday the team did a good job overnight and we made the right choice over set up it wasnt easy today because we had a very tight choice over tyres so we had to make a close decision for every lap but in the end my engineers stayed cool and got it right in q2 the car felt perfect then on the very last lap it was a bit trickier again because the tyres didnt behave quite as well but im happy with p5 we are in a great situation for tomorrow its good for all of us and after hockenheim this is the perfect answer for the faith i have in the whole team
460844 im glad to be in the top ten but that was a difficult qualifying session and p9 is disappointing since this morning i have struggled for grip and balance and unfortunately we werent able to find the answers in time i had the same problems in qualifying so we will have to investigate that tonight im happy for timo who has done a good job this weekend and it is clearly important for us to score as many points as possible for the constructors championship overtaking is very difficult here but tomorrow is a very long race and we will see what we can achieve

460919 the desire by the shell petroleum development company to partner with private hands to reintroduce the mobile clinic scheme in the niger delta is a welcome one which president yaradua will appreciate
460920 this is the reason all other multi national oil and gas companies should emulate the good gesture of the spdc by setting up their own mobile health scheme so that health care delivery will be carried to the door step of riverine niger deltans
460921 that is more reason mr president and indeed the federal government believes that there is need for everyone to come together to discuss who and who will do what and what and what and at what time frame a kind of division of labour in order to achieve better and urgent results

460931 im advocating a program that would see state governments accept the inevitable with ministries reduced to five and state mps serving on a part time basis
460932 there has been a devastating leaching of state government powers to the commonwealth i dont think its a good thing but sadly it is irreversible
460933 meanwhile the national government has clawed indigenous affairs off the states and territories and might as well be making all the decisions in this area
460934 and its hard to see much autonomy left in health policy for the states after the current review
460935 apart from police the one area where they are likely to continue to have real autonomy is in land use planning implementing capital city plans controlling rivers and native vegetation running most national parks making forestry decisions
460936 with 20 years for everyone to make the transition no state leader can be accused of blocking this reform just to preserve his or her own job
460937 as premier for 10 years i saw canberra win every showdown with the states
460938 this is recognising the reality of whats happening the federal government assuming more and more responsibility and the states being left with less and less to do
460939 my granddaughter said the explosion occurred when someone turned the lights on

460950 there are british passport holders who live in the u k who are being found in places like kandahar
460951 while my troops have not actually found british passports on enemy dead there has been a suspicion that with the high number of taliban casualties they have needed to recruit a lot of foreign fighters and some of these are likely to be of british muslim descent
460952 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk
460953 this is something the military understands but the british public does not
460954 there are very small numbers of british citizens traveling out there being trained up and then returning to the uk
460955 dispatched terrorists to a number of locations including spain and the united kingdom
460956 i reached the conclusion that i did not want to leave my family any more for an extended period life is too short there is no point having a family if you are not going to see them

460962 it is scandalous that bureaucrats can approve such a deal which goes against the german governments expressed policy

460975 we have had 10 000 police officers killed or injured trying to bring peace to our communities
460976 we have faced political pressures and challenges from criminals and organized crime but now the ministry has a large support from the people

461003 crimes were committed by the germans under hitlerite domination to which they allowed themselves to be subjected which find no equal in scale and wickedness with any that have darkened the human record the wholesale massacre by systematised processes of six or seven millions of men women and children in the german execution camps exceeds in horror the rough and ready butcheries gengis khan and in scale reduces them to pygmy proportions
461004 the desire for anglo german friendship was so strong as to compel you to withhold essential information about the greatest mass murder in human history
461005 in general sir winston tried to confine himself to happenings on which he could either throw some personal light or provide an account which was not readily accessible to the general public the happenings you mention were so deeply impressed in the mind and imagination of the world that he felt it unnecessary to reiterate them in his volumes
461006 i cant believe that youre building that arcade cabinet so close to your car
461007 lo consideriamo una reazione naturale alla quotidiana aggressione e ai crimini commessi contro il nostro popolo in cisgiordania e in tutte le terre occupate
461008 were republican activists within the party we feel were operating under the law
461009 to my knowledge this type of law only exists in florida our strategy has always been to work in a civil and cooperative fashion within the republican party
461010 un american we have every right to use that name
461011 theyre generally nice people but also are zealots they would marginalize other republicans moderate and conservative this augurs no good for the party in the long term
461012 dedicated themselves to victory in november for the republican slate
461013 bashing the republican party did nothing to advance our agenda
461014 a chunk of the base of republican voters can be turned our way
461015 they obviously do not take their oath seriously because they both are actively trying to torpedo mccains candidacy as evidenced by their stated intentions to demonstrate against mccain at the national convention in minneapolis i want republicans to know whats happening
461016 were a little more expressive and passionate than other party members kind of in your face
461017 i dont believe the state party has legal grounds to prevail in a lawsuit
461018 but if hes a true conservative republican i will support him with vigor if he is not i wont if the republican party would move back to its base it would be more cohesive and more effective getting republicans out to vote
461019 its a threat what happens to all the centrist and less conservative republicans who dont agree with them
461020 were puzzled why in a time when the republican party faces serious problems they want to become a party of exclusion
461021 the caucus doesnt want to exclude people we represent traditional republican party values of low taxes individual responsibility states rights and the constitution i believe most people in st johns county believe in these principles
461022 promote individual liberty limited government and free enterprise within the republican party identifying and supporting candidates sympathetic with these ideals and promoting caucus membership among republican party registrants officials and officeholders
461023 have we reduced the entire republican party platform to a middle east foreign policy
461024 is anyone thinking or reading anything more than main stream media sound bites if my own local party refuses to allow me to join because of what i believe how can i support the party
461025 theres no benefit to the party for the chairman to take a side between different factions unless there is a major issue and the local chairman is unable to deal with it our mission is to get sen mccain elected
461026 we dont need the federal government to tell us how to educate our school children or what is illegal or legal that determination should be left to the states
461027 republicans cant take over the republican party the republican party in st johns county belongs to all republicans
461028 gaining a foothold in political life at every level of government by expanding our precinct leader program
461029 we are doing this because if small government liberty minded conservatives become the majority of precinct committee persons then we can get elected to the boards of county republican executive committees write platforms and change the rules in short we can return the republican party to its principles pro constitution pro gun pro veteran pro low tax pro liberty pro limited government pro individual responsibility pro states rights
461030 i did not support pitts and john charles stevens another caucus founder for membership in the st johns county rec because their often stated intentions were to gain control of the republican party apparatus and turn it into a campaign committee for either a political candidate or a narrow political philosophy that has limited appeal to republican voters much less all voters
461031 smearing the name of good republicans by making false accusations to the county rec leadership and the republican party of florida is totally unacceptable
461032 we are well aware that the role of the rec is to promote and support republican candidates to office
461033 but we do mind being hijacked by supporters of a particular candidate or another political party
461034 incumbent committee members will fight desperately to maintain the positions they now have
461035 they say we have narrow views that dont represent the people of st johns county but if we dont become a party of principles well never beat the democrats because we cant out promise them
461036 their approach is brilliant if i were going to try to take over an organization thats what id do
461037 they obviously do not take their oath seriously because they both are actively trying to torpedo mccains candidacy as evidenced by their stated intentions to demonstrate against mccain at the national convention in minneapolis i want republicans to know whats happening

461113 most essential and basic aspect of familial privacy the right of the family to remain together without the coercive interference of the awesome power of the state
461114 this right to the preservation of family integrity encompasses the reciprocal rights of both parent and children it is the interest of the parent in the companionship care custody and management of his or her children and of the children in not being dislocated from the emotional attachments that derive from the intimacy of daily association with the parent

461116 o ur constitutional system long ago rejected any notion that a child is the mere creature of the state and on the contrary asserted that parents generally have the right coupled with the high duty to recognize and prepare their children for additional obligations the laws concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity experience and capacity for judgment required for making lifes difficult decisions more important historically it has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children
461117 we have long recognized that a parents interests in the nurture upbringing companionship care and custody of children are generally protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment
461118 the liberty interest at issue in this case the interest of parents in the care custody and control of their children is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this court
461119 to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control
461120 t he child is not the mere creature of the state those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right coupled with the high duty to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations
461121 it is cardinal with us that the custody care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder
461122 accordingly so long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children i

461219 in recent days the comments by mr qarase and certain members of his party and their actions have not complemented and in fact have been detrimental to the positive changes that have taken place in recent times
461220 assessments by the security agencies indicate that the comment rhetoric and intentions of these persons could cause instability
461221 the government cannot given these assessments take any risk to neutralize or diminish the positive inroads made in recent times nor can we have such parochial interests sabotage a stable and socially and economically viable path to the next elections
461222 i cannot give specific statements i do not know them off by heart but the point is the assessment of the need for a state of emergency has been done by the experts military intelligence

461229 we must respect their decisions and they are to be thanked for the past service they have rendered to fiji

461240 our own investigations revealed that the president was confronted with a number of constitutional dilemmas as he attempted to steer the country through a turbulent political period
461241 finally on the morning of december 5th the prime minister refused point blank to attend a meeting with the president when called to do so
461242 subsequent to these series of events the president reportedly sought a number of opinions regarding the dismissal of the prime minister for breaches of the constitution the president appears to have contemplated these opinions in private for some time on the morning of december 5th an hour or so later the rfmf commander visited the president and a decision to remove the prime minister was reportedly made shortly afterwards this decision was executed by the commander who announced to the public at 6pm that evening that he had stepped into the presidents shoes the commander of the rfmf stepped into the presidents shoes to remove the prime minister and do what the president himself was prevented from doing
461243 whether or not the president employed the right approach in exercising sovereign power in december 2006 is not for the courts nor the people of fiji to judge the constitutional and conventional power of prerogative was provided to the president as head of state to make his own judgment in this regard and the specific justification for them cannot be investigated by the courts

461246 ja ive had some jobs here i cant complain about that but when youre on the street making a living by begging any money you get can not be saved so its nearly impossible to get off the streets

461248 we are like brothers both of us are in this situation because the south african government cant control the country
461249 it was a lot of bad luck and not because i was white and poor in the new south
461250 they are 90 druggies and alcoholics and they make people not want to help any of us
461251 we care about the people on the street its just that they cause too much problems to the people
461252 and when they get money most of them usually buy glue and start to hurt people who dont give them money
461253 they fight among themselves but at any time they can come and take our stuff like thieves though not all some are real nice
461254 i dont think theres much the government or police can do and its going to get worse with the whole 2010 bullshit the cops will find any way to get ride of us so the government will look good
461255 i go around johannesburg begging for money but melville is one of favorite best places
461256 now they believe that giving street people money is pointless because all of us are doing drugs and glue
461257 we have the right to spend the money anyway we wanted just like any other person

461260 it is too much money i dont have hundreds of rand cause then my family would have no money
461261 most of them are kids with no family so we cant just arrest them or send them home they will just come back the next day we can take them to some quit place and make sure they dont want to come back but most of them usually come back after a week
461262 i guess one thing we can do is catch them selling drugs
461263 its not that we dont care or that theyre black its just that they use the money for drugs and when you offer to buy them food they dont want it and i really hate those guys who are always asking me for money to buy gas for their cars that always seem to break down once a week they must think because theyre white that ill just believe them

461275 i think its important to be honest that youre pregnant
461276 im not ashamed of it but its made finding a job very difficult
461277 were young and we need a double income to have the baby pay off the mortgage and bills it all adds up
461278 i think some employers are insensitive i dont think they have any understanding of pregnant employees they need guidelines
461279 small businesses have trouble just trying to cope with someone being off on maternity leave
461280 hiring someone who is pregnant brings additional complications for them
461281 they look for who can do the job now if the person is leaving on maternity leave in a couple of months and somebody else is there rather than starting all over again they might say this new person has some advantages
461282 a lot of employers regrettably still look at this as something which is detrimental to their business
461283 this mentality of employers is very damaging and belittling to women it makes women feel that theyve done something wrong by being pregnant
461284 even with qualifications behind you businesses get nervous that youre going to leave them when i would actually feel very grateful and would want to return to work part time after the babys born
461285 one business said they had too many pregnant women working there already

461290 on tuesday after an absence of many years i attended a meeting of the tikina council in my district of cuvu expecting the usual vanua type agreeable tone to the proceedings i was wrong and totally unprepared when one of the elders launched a diatribe against the state of affairs in fiji especially the economy and tourism the emotion and power behind his words together with the currency of his thoughts surprised and encouraged me surprised that this elder whose interest hitherto confined to matters of the tikina could articulate so well and with passion issues of national interest and as i looked around the hall it was obvious that what he said represented the view of everyone in the meeting it struck me that while the fijian people may have acquiesced silently to the state of things in fiji no one should take their silence as acceptance

461332 dan ingatlah ketika tuhanmu mengeluarkan keturunan anak anak adam dari sulbi mereka dan allah mengambil kesaksian terhadap jiwa mereka seraya berfirman
461333 dan kami tidak akan mengazab sebelum kami mengutus seorang rasul
461334 mereka kami utus selaku rasul rasul pembawa berita gembira dan pemberi peringatan agar supaya tidak ada alasan bagi manusia membantah allah sesudah diutusnya rasul rasul itu

461354 our differences are deep and real sometimes those differences are cultural or ethnic or racial but i have been especially impressed this week with the comfortable candor with which muslims and christians have clearly stated their own doctrines to one another
461355 we can affirm the appropriateness of simply engaging in dialogue and conversation with each other at this critical time in history it is right that were together we can affirm the development of new and strengthened relationships it has been good to sit together and build new friendships we can affirm the genuine spirit of being willing to listen to each other and seeking to gain understanding into each others perspectives
461356 we are not about politics or power or money or culture
461357 when we u s muslims hear muslims in other parts of the world talk about the crusading spirit of contemporary america the problem of the conflation of religion and politics in america certainly not in islamic countries they would never do that and how that effects muslim life and aspirations we try to explain to them that the american political process is complicated american christianity is diverse and there are many different political opinions even among very devoted christians this is something that its important to have them understand i think its important for them to have this opportunity to hear a more nuanced perspective on how american christians look at the importance of their faith for motivating their sense of social justice and the involvement they have in certain issues

461378 referendums would create a deep crisis in latvia and therefore i shall not participate in the referendum and so shall ask also other people these amendments are judicially questionable and are undemocratic
461379 these constitutional amendments could create a huge crisis and the situation might be created when there is neither elected parliament nor president in latvia
461380 i will vote for the amendments present governance in latvia is not a true democracy but a dictatorship of a narrow circle of a political elite

461466 ste es un tema bien relevante en las reproducciones como las fotocopias no hay acuerdo sobre qu tipo de bibliotecas quedar an exentas del pago de derechos los autores quieren que s lo suceda en las p blicas
461467 las excepciones permiten el uso libre de obras en casos especiales que no causen un perjuicio injustificado al autor a nivel internacional est n ampliamente reconocidas y son necesarias para garantizar otros derechos como las excepciones para discapacitados
461468 estar permitido que cualquiera utilice una obra si dice que no tiene intenci n de lucrar y nosotros tendremos que demostrar en tribunales que la intenci n no es caritativa por ejemplo yo no podr a impedir que un almac n use mis dibujos si dice que va a hacer un libro sobre arte para regalar aunque s lo sea publicidad

461478 over the last eight years the key federal agencies responsible for protecting the public health have been muzzled
461479 when the science says that products that babies put into their mouths could be a threat to their health the safety commission is supposed to act but they did nothing
461480 too often our watchdog agencies have been captured by special interests and the people put in charge have been republican cronies who have had little experience or interest in their government duties remember fema and hurricane katrina
461481 but this week congress said the public interest must come first
461482 we also finally stood up to the tobacco companies fourteen years ago i chaired the hearings at which the tobacco company ceos swore under oath that nicotine was not addictive cigarettes did not cause disease and they did not target our children well they of course lied
461483 when the republicans took control of the congress in the next year and controlled it for the next 12 years efforts on tobacco were stopped
461484 but last year democrats regained the majority in the house and house speaker nancy pelosi made taking on the tobacco companies a top priority and this week we achieved an important milestone
461485 with strong bipartisan support we passed long overdue legislation to stop advertising and promotions targeted to our kids to stop the marketing of candy flavored cigarettes clearly designed to attract our kids to smoking to give the fda the power to both regulate marketing and the manufacture of tobacco products to make sure that we can remove dangerous additives like formaldehyde and ammonia and begin the process of figuring out how to make cigarettes less addictive
461486 tobacco is the only product that when its used as intended kills every day 1 000 kids take up this deadly habit and each year over 400 000 americans die from smoking
461487 i am proud to say that the house has finally passed legislation to protect our children from tobacco addiction and its devastating toll of death and disease
461488 we are in the final months of president bushs last term

461649 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program

461704 es war ein schwieriges qualifying wir sind mit den h rteren reifen rausgefahren das ging ganz gut immer mit zwei runden weil die erste hier immer sehr schlecht ist die zweite runde war eigentlich okay also in dem fenster das wir haben wollten dann haben wir die superweichen drauf gemacht die gingen auch im ersten und zweiten sektor dann im dritten sektor bekam ich graining die letzte kurve ging es nicht mehr gut also hab ich entschlossen es mit den harten zu probieren viel konnten wir nicht verlieren
461705 das ging dann aber auch nicht wirklich vorw rts ich konnte meine zeit ein bisschen verbessern aber letztendlich hat mir einfach der grip gefehlt es war nicht das optimum bei giancarlo fisichella lief es besser wenigstens einer von uns konnte das optimale herausholen aber trotzdem ist der abstand von uns beiden zu gro

461707 ja das stimmt es ist aber heute schon besser gewesen in der ersten session hatten wir so ein massives grainingproblem da war der reifen nach 20 runden komplett weg jetzt ist das schon anders morgen wird es dann am anfang wieder schwierig sein im ersten stint sollte der reifen noch ein bisschen leiden aber dann im laufe des rennens wird es besser
461708 auf jeden fall besonders f r uns mit weniger downforce ist es einfach so schwer die reifen in ein fenster zu bekommen wo sie genau f r eine runde perfekt sind manchmal klappt das manchmal nicht man wei nicht genau warum es ist extrem schwer das einzuteilen
461709 gab es gestern keine probleme mit dem neuen getriebe ohne zugkraftunterbrechung
461710 das war eigentlich den ganzen tag gestern perfekt es gab kleinigkeit die gefunden wurden aber wir konnten mit dem getriebe durchfahren das hatten wir auch geplant das war schon mal sehr erfolgreich wenn man sich die anderen teams anschaut dann hatten die meisten sehr gro e probleme mit diesem getriebe bei uns ist fast alles in ordnung
461711 naja kleinigkeiten aber das gef hrdet den einsatz im rennen daher sind wir noch nicht genau sicher wir waren auch dran es eventuell hier im rennen zu bringen aber das risiko ist zu gro dass es doch streikt und wenn es etwas streikt dann meistens in der einf hrungsrunde oder beim start das w re dann schade
461712 nun stehen nach diesem wochenende zwei rennfreie wochen an was machst du

461798 mr schultz told me that he did not believe the city had obtained in the settlement a sufficient commitment from the nba to locate a new team in seattle at some point in the future
461799 i explained to him that such a promise could not be made because these were issues for future deliberations of committees of the nba board of governors and the board itself

461831 one of the biggest contemporary ironies is that being liberal in the united states of america home of historys greatest democracy has become dangerous that danger is particularly acute for religious liberals as the recent tragedy in knoxville demonstrated
461832 jim adkisson a tennessee aficionado of conservative talkshows took their hosts invective all too literally and shot up a liberal unitarian universalist congregation killing two and wounding six congregants watching a childrens musical caught up in a world of conservative talk radio he reportedly expected to be able to carry on shooting unimpeded by the spineless gay loving pacifists and was surprised when they tackled him and brought him down
461833 no conservatives did not cause this bloodbath jim adkisson allegedly did but in telling him liberals were the source of his every disaffection and woe conservatives certainly validated the hatred and madness that drove him
461834 it would be a fitting tribute to those who were lost in knoxville if this tragedy gave the authors of the ongoing morality play cause for pause and reflection or is accountability yet another lost conservative value

461840 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
461841 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
461842 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
461843 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
461844 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
461845 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
461846 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
461847 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances

461858 we do have skill and we count on players to make plays but its really all part of our team concept
461859 the team concept does help us when we are battling against the injuries because the players who step in expect to do well plus the people who are on the team and have those players step in expect those people to perform well
461860 hes practised well all week and hes practised with a kind of aggressiveness that he didnt have during the time that he was injured i expect him to play well
461861 in order for us to win everybody has to do their part

461886 the company advertised my dream job on one of the big employment websites having contacted their vp of human resources within the last year i was able to send my resume directly to him rather than through the usual website channel

461933 estoy muy muy muy feliz de poder ser n mero uno y me ha dado una gran satisfacci n alcanzar lo m s alto del ranking pero tendr poco tiempo para disfrutarlo porque est n muy cerca los juegos ol mpicos y el abierto de estados unidos
461934 hemos superado con la unidad a quienes buscaban nuestra divisi n unidos comenzamos esta lucha y pese a quien pese unidos la terminaremos el campo y la argentina son una cosa indivisible nuestra identidad como pa s el ser nacional esta inexorablemente ligado al campo a nuestra cultura y a nuestros valores as cuando se ofende al campo se ofende al pueblo y cuando se ataca al campo se ataca a la argentina
461935 ich bin zufrieden aber deswegen muss ich keine freudenspr nge machen
461936 so habe ich meine reifen nicht auf temperatur gebracht und war sogar langsamer als auf gebrauchten reifen
461937 es ist sch n vor kimi r ikk nen zu stehen aber warten wir ab welche taktik ferrari f hrt es ist noch kein grund freudenspr nge zu machen
461938 ich w rde mich mehr freuen wenn wir die konstanz ber das jahr hinweg reinbringen k nnen als wenn wir hier ein gutes einzelresultat einfahren
461939 es ist schade dass ich es in q3 nicht mehr geschafft habe das beste aus dem auto herauszuholen vor allem wegen des verkehrs
461940 in den ersten beiden teilen des qualifyings f hlte sich das auto sehr gut an was man auch an den zeiten konnte danach ist es mir nicht mehr gelungen die reifen gut auf die fliegende runde vorzubereiten
461941 mir ist auf meiner letzten runde ein missgeschick passiert das einige zeit gekostet hat nachdem schon die vorherige runde nicht so gut war konsequenz war der sechste platz nat rlich bin ich nicht gl cklich damit
461942 heute morgen waren wir gl cklich mit dem auto auch im qualifying war es in ordnung
461943 das berholen ist hier nicht leicht aber wir haben eine gute pace und werden versuchen die beiden fahrer vor uns anzugreifen
461944 morgen wird es wichtig sein einen guten start zu erzielen was bedeutet dass felipe seine ungerade startposition und die saubere seite nutzen muss
461945 es w re einfach darauf zu verweisen dass wir wieder die langsamsten waren aber wir sind genauso in q1 ausgeschieden wie ein bmw ein honda und ein williams das zeigt wie hart es in diesem feld zugeht
461946 ich bin nicht zu 100 prozent zufrieden mit meiner session die reifen haben sich nicht so verhalten wie wir es erwartet hatten das graining hat eine gute balance des autos unm glich gemacht
461947 ich hatte mich am ende f r die h rtere reifenmischung entschieden wodurch sich das graining noch in grenzen hielt
461948 das ziel war eine zeit von 1 21 700 minuten zu erzielen am ende waren wir sogar um eine zehntelsekunde schneller
461949 die balance des autos war in ordnung das griplevel leider nicht wir m ssen akzeptieren dass wir auf dieser strecke nicht sonderlich stark sind
461950 jetzt z hlt jede runde wir d rfen keine fehler machen
461951 wir haben die m glichkeit mit beiden autos zu punkten
461952 sie sind hier sehr schnell also wird es f r uns ein verteidigungsrennen gegen toyota
461953 sie werden morgen theoretisch mehr punkte holen als wir also m ssen wir den schaden begrenzen so viele punkte wie m glich einfahren
461954 wir sind siebter und vor uns stehen sechs autos die das gesamte wochenende etwas schneller waren
461955 wir werden nicht schneller als r ikk nen kubica die toyota oder die mclaren sein
461956 aber in einem normalen rennen wird es schwierig besser als siebter zu werden
461957 trotz der massiven nutzung von regenerativen energien und der umsetzung von energieeffizienzma nahmen steht ab 2012 nicht mehr gen gend gesicherte kraftwerksleistung zur verf gung um die jahresh chstlast effizient zu decken
461958 nach neuen berechnungen wird die stroml cke noch gr er wenn die geplanten kraftwerke in hamburg moorburg mainz wiesbaden und der neue block im hessischen werk staudinger nicht gebaut werden k nnen dann fehlen k nftig 15 000 megawatt und die lassen sich nicht einfach durch den weiteren ausbau von erneuerbaren energien ersetzen
461959 wir m ssen uns entscheiden entweder wir bauen hocheffiziente kohle und erdgaskraftwerke oder wir m ssen die atommeiler l nger laufen lassen
461960 die vorhandenen und geplanten europ ischen kraftwerke reichen schon ab 2015 nicht mehr aus um eine verst rkte nachfrage aus deutschland zu decken
461961 youre going to write a blog post about how your ass was beaten by an elephant of course
461962 yea behold i will tell you in your mind and in your heart by the holy ghost which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart
461963 now we will compare the word unto a seed now if ye give place that a seed may be planted in your heart behold if it be a true seed or a good seed if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief that ye will resist the spirit of the lord behold it will begin to swell within your breasts and when you feel these swelling motions ye will begin to say within yourselves it must needs be that this is a good seed or that the word is good for it beginneth to enlarge my soul yea it beginneth to enlighten my understanding yea it beginneth to be delicious to me
461964 maybe a veterinarian would be able to tell us more about the kind of illness birds would face in the wild
461965 possibly a tumour like a papilloma possibly even an abscess but it looks too cauliflorous and mobile to be an abscess dont look like pox virus as it produces smaller lumps and in greater numbers
461966 you can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world but when youre finished youll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird so lets look at the bird and see what its doing thats what counts i learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something

461975 so it is particularly disconcerting to note the current hype and apparent national enthusiasm for the latest movie installment based on the record box office receipts it would appear that not only is our world being further dumbed down but there are a number of opportunistic people who are getting rich in the process
461976 we have got to move away from these beautifully choreographed speeches which appeal to groups of voters who are unassailably in the obama camp already
461977 what plays well with the educated liberal voter sometimes grates with the blue collar folk whom we need on our side if we are going to win
461978 even on his worst day bill clinton was able to signal that he understood voters concerns and that he felt their pain
461979 obama has no trouble with the campaign stagecraft but this isnt harvard its the beer hall he has to talk in language that people understand
461980 look obama has pulled off a good tour of europe and it was probably necessary
461981 what we need now is campaign events in hospital emergency rooms and in unemployment offices and small town diners these people have a vote

461990 cell phones are causing a social and economic impact much more dramatic and disruptive than ever expected
461991 here are a number of key factors we look at when evaluating the potential for village phone in a specific market rural telecommunications coverage does telecommunications coverage extend out into rural areas or is it concentrated in urban settings while the external antenna we use can extend the reach up to 35km from a base station if there is no base station within 35km of a potential village phone operator there is no way they can get a signal for their phone strength of microfinance sector how many microfinance institutions are in the country what is their outreach i e how many clients do they have are those clients in urban or rural settings rural demand are there any alternatives for making public access calls how far do people travel to make a phone call what percentage of people own their own mobile phone now a market well suited for village phone is one where there is coverage in rural areas a strong microfinance presence in rural areas to act as your channel to market and high unmet demand for public access telecommunication services

461998 the 21 year old barron scooter collins a convicted drug dealer
461999 its pretty extraordinary that they should have used a taser in this case
462000 the need to stop the behavior should clearly justify the potential for additional risks
462001 obviously law enforcement agencies dont want to use a taser on young children pregnant woman or elderly people

462159 i dont think nafta has been good for americans and i never have

462214 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
462215 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
462216 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
462217 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy

462244 me produce tristeza que esa gesti n que estaba adelantando el presidente ch vez y la senadora piedad c rdoba que iba avanzando que era una puerta muy importante se haya truncado de esta manera

462261 we didnt have to mess with others and it was fun
462262 it makes a great deal of sense that mccain and obama are the first senators who will jump to the presidency in a long time
462263 obama knows how to maneuver problems by using the right language how to use the visuals of national politics how to be pragmatic all senate skills though he hasnt been there for long
462264 in mccains case the senate chamber allowed him to build this independent maverick streak that made him the perfect nominee for this cycle
462265 and i think as president hell engage congress in untraditional ways he has a great sense of what will pass on the hill hes learned from the bush years that its tough to force feed congress and like l b j he understands power and how to use it
462266 normally a change election is about a rejection of a certain ideology or the ultimate triumph of a countering ideology like reagan in 80 and gingrich in 94
462267 this one strikes me as all about electing a person who can come in and solve big problems putting the country first not ideology
462268 what people are looking for most of all is someone who is an antidote to what they see as the current presidents negatives too divisive too stuck in his ways a man who doesnt share americans priorities
462269 are you kidding me he didnt catch this your tonsils are bright red swollen inflamed and hard as a rock because they are infected you have to get them removed okay i can tell you exactly whats wrong now back in may you caught a little bronchitis probably so small you never even noticed but then your tonsils started acting up at the same time and that started making the bronchitis worse which in turn made your tonsils worse so on and so on but you have chronic tonsillitis if you get them removed all of this will go away immediately

462302 the percentage of students who scored at the proficient or advanced levels increased significantly in both communication arts and math we had seen little or no movement in the scores for these grade levels in recent years so this is an encouraging sign

462304 they would be a significant player if they utilized that money in kansas
462305 we have said if there is any proof of pakistans involvement we would like to see the proof of that because merely alleging something means nothing
462306 as far as i know and as far as we are informed the army has worked very hard to root any such elements out
462307 because as you know they were exposed to a very long engagement with the afghan resistance and those were really jihadis of a particular hardcore kind

462334 it takes three days to get a jet ski license but akshay explained the time constraints he did a three day course in 12 hours he got up at 6 am and got his license by 7 pm he had to give a written and practical test the action scene we have shot is one of the most expensive ones that bollywood has ever seen and has been directed by danny baldwin
462335 going through a theory and practical exam was like going back to school
462336 when we went for a reccee to australia we saw a lot of show reels and met a lot of technicians but we saw a clear synergy with danny as his style of action was exactly what we needed the beauty about the action in singh is kinng is that not only is it great to look at but makes the audience laugh as well
462337 it is similar only in quality these are very high end action sequences akshay had to be very careful in certain sequences for instance the scene in which he had to jump from one moving lift to another without supporting cables but akshay is akshay he did it with much panache and agility enjoy watching it in the film

462346 the fundamental source of high gas prices is the fact that supply is not keeping pace with demand to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home so in june i called on congress to lift the legislative ban that prevents offshore exploration of parts of the outer continental shelf or ocs but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote
462347 first lifting the ban would allow our nation to take advantage of a large and reliable source of domestic oil experts believe that these restricted areas could eventually produce about 18 billion barrels of oil thats almost 10 years worth of americas current oil production
462348 bringing these resources online will take time and that means that the need for congressional action is urgent
462349 yes it will take time at least a decade but the president doesnt want you to know that
462350 this means that the only thing now standing between the american people and these vast oil resources is the united states congress the sooner congress lifts the ban the sooner we can get this oil from beneath the ocean floor to your gas tank

462361 there has been a devastating leaching of state government powers to the commonwealth i dont think its a good thing but sadly it is irreversible
462362 meanwhile the national government has clawed indigenous affairs off the states and territories and might as well be making all the decisions in this area
462363 and its hard to see much autonomy left in health policy for the states after the current review

462370 the dogs of war are loose in europe and a nice noise they are making it was started by a dachshund that is thought to have gone made though there was so much method in his madness that this is doubtful note for the ignorant the german for dog is hund the english for german is hun dachshund means badger dog and he is sometime more badgered than he likes mated with the dachshund for better or for worse was an austrian mongrel by the fine unwritten law of dogdom big dogs never attack little dogs there are however scallywags in every community and egged on by the dachshund for private ends the mongrel started bullying a little servian and the fat was in the fire for the little servian had a great big friend in the form of a russian bear and he stood up for his pal and that was what the dachshund wanted he hoped that a big row would ensue and in the confusion he intended to steal a bone or two that he had his eye on for some time he got what he wanted and a little more for the russian bear had friends too there was a very game little belgian griffon and there was a great big french poodle a smart dandified fellow and there was a bulldog rather a sleepy chap this last one and the dachshund despised him because he was not always yapping and snaring but the bulldog has a habit of sleeping with one eye open and when he is roused he grips and wont let go the dachshund started by attacking the belgian griffon as being the smallest and mauled the poor creature cruelly but was quite unable to kill her and he was mistaken as to the others he found that the dandified poodle could fight and that the bulldog had not lost the knack of not lettinggo and that russia after all was a rusher and soon the bear idea made the dachshund tremble and even the little servian gave the austrian mongrel some nasty bites and so did a neighbour of his named monty the dachshund now began to look round for friends but they seemed strangely scarce he had relied on an italian greyhound a thoroughbred named italia but italia dissembled her love in the strangest way and asserted that war was a luxury which she could not afford just now all the same italia loaded her gun and who knows but what it may go off and whom it may go off and whom it may hit for accidents will happen in the best regulated families the dachshund to his annoyance found only one friend and that was a dog of constantinople the dogs of constantinople are quite well known for being fond of offal meanwhile the rest of the european happy family looked on and who shall say how the row will spread theres the greek with his knife ready to take a slice of turkey there are the balkans determined not to be baulked of their own little ambtions theres the spaniard fond of bull fighting so long as he is not a john bull theres the portugee just spoiling for a scrap theres the swiss suffering from cold feet theres the dutchman who keeps smiling with difficulty still some nice meaty bones may come his way and in any event he may be relied upon to play the game and not to be a double dutchman another note for the ignorant holland used to be known as a low lying country but this title has now been filched by germany and up north the norwegian the swede and the great dane all have their eyes well skinned all this and more may be seen depicted above search well and you may find many things but not peace peace has gone to the dogs for the present until a satisfactory muzzle has been found for that dachshund meanwhile the dachshunds heart bleeds for belgium and his nose for great britain
462371 of great collecting value european revue kill that eagle this satirical map of europe is a document proving the perfidy of albion whilst german assets and blood fight for the fatherland england regards the war merely as business by saying sneeringly business as usual the map reproduces the english original exactly the few words are transposed into german for better understanding the price of this map in london is 1 shilling 1 mark reproduced by a german printer without kind permission from our english cousin as an eternal memento printer and publisher w n lting kaiser wilhelmstr 93 hamburg 36

462455 help remind big media that it broadcasts on public airwaves community members have the legal right to examine radio stations public files upon request and commercial radio licenses must be renewed every eight years the fcc does accept comments from the public during the renewal process any station which is found to be operating outside the public interest can be fined or have its license revoked get involved becoming a part of an organized effort seeking more community accountability in commercial radio is an effective way to put pressure on stations at the very least undertakings like the ccma s campaign or r e a c s crusade have let urban radios corporate bosses know that somebodys watching them and at best have hit these companies where it counts in the pocketbook become an active listener without community feedback mds and pds can only rely on research and consultants if a station gets enough requests for a song by a local artist it could result in increased mixshow spins or even being added to rotation use the internet usually web addresses for key station personnel can be found on that stations homepage it only takes five minutes to send an email to every urban station in your region inform urban stations of events they should be covering most of the time a commercial stations idea of outreach is to send their promotional street teams to clubs and concerts if you know of an event promoting positive community values dont hesitate to contact the station and let them know about it

462464 i think that its a good time for hip hop in the sense that theres great music being made by artists allover the world
462465 but its a bad time commercially hip hop is on the dark side of the moon as far as the media is concerned sooner or later things will change and all this terrible haircut indie rock will vanish but until then weve just got to hang in there
462466 indies can make quick decisions and do much better deals with artists
462467 if you have a good person fighting your corner at a major label then you can have a long career
462468 on the way up artists such as danger mouse are huge creative talents and need the attention that an indie can give them later in an artists career indies provide a creative environment
462469 mf dooms next solo project under his doom moniker will be on lex a major label would probably never sign doom directly because hes unlikely to deliver the pop success they need but he is probably the most important creative force in hip hop
462470 indies are picking up a lot of acts that arent going to fit on a major label in 2008 and releasing records from a lot of acts who even five years ago would have been on a major
462471 theres no championing of independent status by artists like there was during the mid to late nineties
462472 no ones coming out boasting about being independent people just seem to accept that most rappers arent going to be given a chance on a major label so being on an indie is a natural fit and possibly their only real option
462473 i think indie labels work with artists who genuinely push the envelope
462474 most indies will give an artist total creative freedom so when indies push the envelope its really by giving the artists room to make amazing records

462480 we work closely with leaders in the higher education community because we both have a stake in ensuring that intellectual property continues to be a strong vibrant part of our nations economy

462536 nos tenemos que esforzar en una informaci n que sea confiable oportuna y debidamente seleccionada ese es el desafi para los medios de comunicaci n
462537 hay un intento del gobierno de satanizar a los secundarios
462538 vos jos ancalao te cagastes solo y donde te pillemos te vamos a liquidar
462539 insultar golpear y en ltimo caso humillar de la forma en la que se le hizo y no conformes con ello con el objetivo de eludir su responsabilidad en los acontecimientos se le acusa y se le imponen cargos sin fundamentos s lidos que son requerimiento esencial en este tipo de casos
462540 junto con lo mencionado previamente es menester mencionar y explicitar el hecho que el acusado est siendo procesado por el mismo tribunal militar regional que dej impune a los asesinos de los hermanos alex lemun y mat as katrileo por lo cual es clara la tendencia del tribunal en cuesti n
462541 no tenemos ninguna confirmaci n oficial sobre la llegada de alg n ministro o si nos van a llamar para entrevistarnos con el gobernador en la capital de la provincia por lo que nosotros nos mantenemos firmes en esa ocupaci n pac fica que es una reivindicaci n territorial
462542 venimos a reivindicar nuestro derecho territorial con un acto de ocupaci n pac fica pero las medidas de acci n directa se ir n incrementando si la provincia no acusa recibo
462543 cabe recordar que dicha acusaci n corresponde a la formulada por el ex director de conadi jaime andrade qui n habr a concurrido a participar de una reuni n en la comunidad el d a 29 de agosto del 2006 informando posteriormente por medio de una conferencia de prensa que habr a sido objeto de agresiones por parte de nuestra gente

462546 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado
462547 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n
462548 las provincias son libres para crear las instancias judiciales que estimen apropiadas pero no pueden vedar a ninguna de ellas y menos a las m s altas la aplicaci n preferente de la constituci n nacional

462579 we got a little bit of race runs said clint bowyer who qualified 30th and was looking forward to trying to improve his car in the final
462580 it isnt like we havent been here in two or three years we were just here six weeks ago so everybody kind of knows what to expect as far as the track goes
462581 this track does swing a lot weather related he added
462582 when it clouds up it gains a lot of grip and a lot of speed when the sun breaks out it gets slick and greasy that has a lot to do with the outcome of the race and hopefully it will be just fine
462583 i think we had a pretty good baseline last time here
462584 theres always a menu of stuff that we would like to try to improve our car like everyone else barraclough said
462585 and a lot of these teams have a lot more experience here than us but with the car of tomorrow everybody is trying to build a new catalog of tools in their chest to improve their car for certain things
462586 the one thing we have going for us even though we made just a short race run off the track on friday that helps out knowing that you rolled off the truck and it went decent
462587 i believe theyre going to come through in the clutch and keep getting better
462588 we dont ever try to project anything into the future we basically show up each day and play the game and just have faith that everythings going to be great at the end
462589 all the guys are doing our part one after the next
462590 i thought we did a good job of laying off pitches getting him in trouble but we didnt do a very good job of keeping him in trouble
462591 were in a good position weve really done a great job this weekend
462592 its been a pretty decent weekend the pace of the car is great i think its a great day to have me and heikki 1 2 its about time we did that said hamilton who leads massa by four points and raikkonen by seven in the standings
462593 kovalainen is pushing me hard but thats a good thing
462594 we didnt seem to be very strong this morning but looking at the lap times from the first two sessions i think we are there
462595 the lap wasnt perfect the traffic meant i couldnt prepare my tires massa said
462596 he did a better job but im still in a good position
462597 the car wasnt too bad but i went off and couldnt stay on the circuit he said
462598 im totally disappointed heidfeld said of his worst qualifying result of the season

462608 i backed off when i saw spectators on the stage and federico pulled over i think it is a horrible stage i couldnt get a rhythm
462609 i answered two of them and got lots of missed calls but i told them they could do what they like it didnt stop me taking the case
462610 theres no concrete evidence against him but still the court insists on keeping him in jail and postponing the trial

462632 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead and we are talking about attacks like the subprime mortgage that you spoke of that wasnt just a general ambiguous kind of phenomena but a phenomena that targeted the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and javon dawson right here in st petersburg by the st petersburg police and jena 6 and hurricane katrina and the list goes on in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country

462643 these hotels are justifiably outraged by this order which puts them in the awkward position of having to craft pop up messages explaining to their customers that their web history communications searches and key strokes are being spied on by the chinese government
462644 they have no reasonable expectation of privacy in public or private locations
462645 all hotel rooms and offices are considered to be subject to on site or remote technical monitoring at all times

462657 in reality seeks to modify the social and cultural reality of spain transforming its identity
462658 this social and cultural project aims to construct a secular society without any moral or religious reference attempting to impose nihilist thought and deliberately eliminating everything catholic from public life
462659 powerful and sometimes dark forces present everywhere from the media to schools
462660 thus the church is presented as the enemy of democracy and modernization opposed to science and progress against freedom the enemy of happiness or the promoter of division confrontation and violence in an effort to isolate religion to private life
462661 the silencing of god is the fundamental event of our times
462662 there is nothing else that compares in terms of its radicalism and serious consequences

462664 he says that catholicism does not condemn contraception but only distinguishes between natural and artificial contraception
462665 the second area which his holiness would stress is that of promotion he repeats his encouragement and gratitude to all those who work for the promotion of natural family planning whether directly with couples or in medical and social endeavors
462666 it is important that public authorities and international bodies medical personnel and social workers marriage counsellors and educators should recognize the high positive values that are to be found in the natural methods in which the dignity of the human person is fostered a knowledge and understanding of fertility help to assure personal autonomy by liberating couples from artificial means while leading them to a degree of sexual self mastery which is in direct contrast with the permissiveness and promiscuity that today constitute grave social problems to be solved
462667 those using what the church considers to be natural is not really contraception at all in fact even if one follows the nfp natural family planning it is never 100 and therefore the person is not acting in a way as to eliminate the pro creative sic from the act itself
462668 this gene bridges hasnt a clue as to what in the world he is talking about nor what the catholic church teaches

462671 las primeras estimaciones del sistema del cdc revelan que la epidemia de vih es y ha sido peor de lo que se conoce previamente los resultados indican que aproximadamente 56 300 nuevas infecciones por vih se produjeron en el 2006 en estados unidos

462682 i think youre misinformed everything you mentioned i did speak about
462683 islam isnt in america to be equal to any other faiths but to become dominant the koran the muslim book of scripture should be the highest authority in america and islam the only accepted religion on earth
462684 we are not fighting so that you will offer us something we are fighting to eliminate you
462685 first chase out the invaders from our territory in palestine in iraq and everywhere in islamic land
462686 second instal sharia islamic law on the entire earth and spread islamic justice there the attacks will not cease until after the victory of islam and the setting up of sharia
462687 i was in union mo which is 98 percent white a rural conservative and what i said was what i think everyone knows which is that i don t look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
462688 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
462689 i am absolutely confident that the people in union mo or jacksonville florida or any other town in the country at the end of the day are going to be making the decision based on what is best for their lives statistics
462690 the main reason for our suspension is sluggish fishing offshore
462691 the focus of the interviews were his performance as police chief
462692 thats what hes being hired for thats not to say we skimmed over the rest of his career we were aware of his work in the lapd unit
462693 before nafta mexico controlled all its grain imports through restrictive licensing and high tariffs
462694 we fully support the action taken today by the ioc
462695 athletes must understand that if they make the choice to cheat there will be consequences and those consequences can be severe
462696 its been a pretty decent weekend for us so far and i feel safe with the position were in
462697 the team have done a great job in improving our car even from the last weekend and it would be great to get a 1 2 on sunday it would be about time
462698 i wasnt 100 percent happy with my laps in q3
462699 i went out on the track at a little bit of a wrong time when there were too many cars around
462700 that made it really tricky for the preparation of my tyres but i think our lap times from the first two qualifying sessions showed that we are pretty strong
462701 i definitely have the feeling we can push these guys tomorrow
462702 dates back to a period during the mid 20th century that saw a proliferation of
462703 seems like every day the choice just gets clearer and clearer were saved by love or were cooked by hate this is the time for everyone who believes in love to take a stand
462704 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
462705 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
462706 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
462707 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
462708 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
462709 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
462710 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
462711 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
462712 we are continuing to work to have the organizers deliver what has been pledged what has been outlined
462713 id like to suggest the fight against illegal drugs be included in the battle against global warming

462731 this is my hood youll need a 13 or better to walk through here
462732 have a question we can find someone who knows the answer
462733 organizations that are seen as the most effective users of fpa often bring together an fpa expert and a system expert when they wish to size an application
462734 the number produced by fpa is a measure of system size actually a measure of the information processing requirements for the system or the change to those information processing requirements of itself this has little value but it is a basic data element i must stress that fpa is not an estimating technique nor is it a device for productivity measurement what fpa does is enable such activity by providing the basic data size once you have a size value this can feed into the estimation process for effort or cost size values are also used in basic productivity measures and as you will see later in many other measures that provide meaningful information
462735 iterative approaches tend to reduce the impact of inadequate upstream work but they dont eliminate it
462736 one common rule of thumb is to plan to specify about 80 percent of the requirements up front allocate time for additional requirements to be specified later and then practice systematic change control to accept only the most valuable new requirements as the project progresses
462737 some projects spend too little time on prerequisites which exposes construction to an unnecessarily high rate of destabilizing changes and prevents the project from making consistent progress some projects do too much up front they doggedly adhere to requirements and plans that have been invalidated by downstream discoveries and that can also impede progress during construction
462738 if the requirements are explicit the user can review them and agree to them if theyre not the programmer usually ends up making requirements decisions during programming
462739 a plan to follow the requirements rigidly is actually a plan not to respond to your customer
462740 how much change is typical studies at ibm and other companies have found that the average project experiences about a 25 percent change in requirements during development boehm 1981 jones 1994 jones 2000 which accounts for 70 to 85 percent of the rework on a typical project leffingwell 1997 wiegers 2003
462741 generally a well run project devotes about 10 to 20 percent of its effort and about 20 to 30 percent of its schedule to requirements architecture and up front planning mcconnell 1998 kruchten 2000

462747 online access to internet information also helps to democratize the capital markets by enabling many small investors to access corporate information
462748 information in electronic documents is often more easily searchable than information in paper documents shareholders will be better able to go directly to any section of the document that they are particularly interested in the amendments also will permit shareholders to more easily evaluate data and transfer data using analytical tools such as spreadsheet programs such tools enable users to compare relevant data about several companies more easily
462749 substitute a philosophy of full disclosure for the philosophy of caveat emptor
462750 a valuable element of many of such company web site presentations is that they present the most important general information about a company on the opening page with embedded links that enable the reader to drill down to more detail by clicking on the links in this way viewers can follow a path into and thereby obtain increasingly greater details about the financial statements a companys strategy and products its management and corporate governance and its many other areas in which investors and others may have an interest
462751 a s technology continues to progress accessing the proxy materials on the internet should increase the utility of our disclosure requirements to shareholders information in electronic documents is often more easily searchable than information in paper documents shareholders will be better able to go directly to any section of the document that they are particularly interested in
462752 including hyperlinks directly to the reports or other materials filed on edgar or on another third party web site where the reports or other materials are made available in the appropriate timeframe and access to the reports or other materials is free of charge to the user
462753 a privileged few gain an informational edge and the ability to use that edge to profit from their superior access to corporate insiders rather than from their skill acumen or diligence
462754 in order to make information public it must be disseminated in a manner calculated to reach the securities market place in general through recognized channels of distribution and public investors must be afforded a reasonable waiting period to react to the information
462755 information is nonpublic if it has not been disseminated in a manner making it available to investors generally
462756 web site availability of the interactive data would encourage its widespread dissemination
462757 where the news is of a sort which is not readily translatable into investment action insiders may not take advantage of their advance opportunity to evaluate the information by acting immediately upon dissemination
462758 a s technology evolves and as more investors have access to and use the internet we believe that some companies whose web sites are widely followed by the investment community could use such a method
462759 reasonably designed to provide broad non exclusionary distribution of the information to the public
462760 the issuer may use a method or combination of methods of disclosure in recognition of the fact that it may not always be possible or desirable for an issuer to rely on a single method of disclosure as reasonably designed to effect broad public disclosure
462761 a n issuers methods of making disclosure in a particular case should be judged with respect to what is reasonably designed to effect broad non exclusionary distribution in light of all the relevant facts and circumstances

462764 are responsible for the accuracy of their statements that reasonably can be expected to reach investors or the securities markets regardless of the medium through which the statements are made including the internet
462765 there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available
462766 make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading
462767 expressly adopt ed the tsc industries standard of materiality for the 10 b and rule 10b 5 context
462768 a press release disseminated over a wire service or through other customary means is considered to have been issued once and thereafter is not recirculated to the marketplace the same press release posted on a companys web site potentially has a longer life because it provides a record that can be accessed by investors at any time and upon which investors potentially could rely when making an investment decision without independent verification in effect a statement may be considered to be republished each time that it is accessed by an investor or for that matter each day that it appears on the web site commentators have suggested that if a statement is deemed to be republished it may potentially give rise to liability under section 10 b of the exchange act and rule 10b 5
462769 in the context of a document required to be filed or delivered under the federal securities laws we believe that when a company embeds a hyperlink to a web site within the document the company should always be deemed to be adopting the hyperlinked information

462777 recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commissions rules and forms

462779 we believe that requiring readable and printable formats is important so that shareholders have meaningful access to the proxy materials
462780 whether a companys web site is a recognized channel of distribution of information will depend on the steps that the company has taken to alert the market to its web site and its disclosure practices as well as the use by investors and the market of the companys web site
462781 our judgement is that this merciless attack was the work of the bloody separatist group

462830 and its hard to see much autonomy left in health policy for the states after the current review

463055 as things stand perhaps to look at an inflation rate of 8 9 per cent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009
463056 you can get a much lower rate of inflation if there is confluence of favourable factors such as moderation in oil prices and so on otherwise if the oil prices remain at the prevailing rate that is best estimate for inflation

463087 no matter how long the courts of this state this nation or any other nation review re review and re review once again the disgusting facts of this crime and these perpetrators the result should be the same these juries reached a reasonable verdict beyond a reasonable doubt that a sentence of death was the only appropriate punishment under texas law
463088 the world court has no standing in texas and texas is not bound by a ruling or edict from a foreign court

463131 thats such a shame especially for the ones who were clean and its most important for the athletes who were second
463132 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it

463138 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
463139 unfortunately some special interests have declared war on the initiative process using tactics ranging from restrictive laws to outright thuggery
463140 representative government will remain the enduring feature of american democracy but the initiative process is a valuable safety valve attempts to arbitrarily curb the initiative or to intimidate people from exercising their right to participate must be resisted its a civil liberties issue that should unite people of good will on both the right and left
463141 i believe in the initiative and referendum which should be used not to destroy representative government but to correct it whenever it becomes misrepresentative
463142 put front and center empowering the american people in direct democracy format so they can move in when their so called representatives cave in to the interests of big business campaign finance reform has got to go hand in hand with direct democracy like initiative referendum recall
463143 more direct democracy reflecting the preamble to our constitution which starts with we the people and not we the corporations

463163 mevrouw ik begrijp het volkomen luistert u eens ik neem aan dat het u best lukt om v r maandag de andere twee ruiten ook een tikje te geven
463164 een klein tikje is genoeg mevrouw dan zijn alle drie de ramen kapot en krijgt u ze gewoon alle drie vergoed is veel beter toch ik noteer hier gewoon dat de wind de oorzaak is van de schade de deur klapte dicht en rinkeldekinkel
463165 precies mevrouw u begrijpt het maar dit blijft natuurlijk tussen u en mij mevrouw maandag neemt het plaatselijke glaszettersbedrijf contact met u op om de reparatie uit te voeren over de rekening hoeft u zich geen zorgen te maken de verzekering betaalt

463174 managed the event brilliantly if deceptively getting the double benefit of appearing to be victimized by the invasive israeli press and prayer thieving jew while at the same time leaking out his humble christian plea to the lord

463176 deserves sharp condemnation and represents a desecration of the holy site
463177 notes which are placed in the western wall are between the person and his maker heaven forbid that one should read them or use them in any way the custom of placing notes between the stones of the western wall is ancient and is used as a means of expression by a person praying to his creator
463178 it now appears that maariv had collaborated with the obama campaign in getting the private prayer with its modest supplication to the lord out to the public
463179 since obama is not a jew publishing the note does not constitute an infringement on his right to privacy
463180 maariv violated the law protecting holy sites several clauses in the penal code and also infringed upon the basic rights of a persons honor and freedom

463200 if he had sought a formal comment i would have told him what i have said publicly before in my view the decision to invade iraq in 2003 was an extremely serious strategic error
463201 but the task of the moment is not to cry over spilt milk rather to help clean it up a task in which the surge the comprehensive counterinsurgency approach and our troops on the ground are admirably succeeding
463202 we welcome this acquittal it shows that the criminal justice system in this country is not wholly useless indeed since mr george would probably never have been allowed a retrial in most other countries we can say that we still have one of the best criminal justice systems in the world
463203 this being said an innocent man has had nine years of his life taken away the remainder of his life may be passed in the shadow of these past nine years he can be given financial compensation he cannot be given his life back
463204 we call on the home office to begin an immediate enquiry into what happened if criminal acts were committed by the relevant police officers and lawyers at the crown prosecution service we call for criminal prosecutions if there was wrongdoing that falls short of the criminal we call for the names and photographs of the persons concerned to be published and for these persons to be dismissed from government service and to suffer the greatest disadvantages with regard to their pensions allowed by law

463212 our grandfather thought frank was a point of connection a bridge if you will to the larger african american experience for my brother
463213 frank was part of a group of black vanguard intellectuals
463214 the people that he came into contact with throughout his life like richard wright and margaret walker were very significant
463215 you could get a lot of strength from a person like frank who had suffered all the discrimination that a black man goes through in america

463222 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
463223 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate

463226 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
463227 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper

463229 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances

463231 my sister kindly offered to be my surrogate she already has a family and we didnt think it was any big deal
463232 our families are 100 per cent behind us and so initially we thought theres no reason why we cant do this but it turns out there is a big reason
463233 my sister and her husband both need to be made sterile it is crazy
463234 rushed through and not all the implications were thought about
463235 they didnt actually make surrogacy illegal but they made it bloody difficult
463236 it is fairly bizarre that you ask the surrogate who you would expect to be fertile to be infertile and that you expect her partner to also be infertile
463237 it actually discriminates against people who want to do surrogacy and its affected couples since technology allowed surrogacy
463238 i just dont understand why if were an infertile couple we cant access the same help as everybody else

463254 is to say it is what happens to society when the defenses against information glut have broken down it is what happens when institutional life becomes inadequate to cope with too much information it is what happens when a culture overcome by information generated by technology tries to employ technology itself as a means of providing clear direction and humane purpose the effort is mostly doomed to failure
463255 try to raise the questions of whats to become of us if we lose a sense of spirituality if we devote all of our resources and our psychic energies to making bigger and better machinery and designing better techniques will we become less human in some sort of traditional way of defining that
463256 the tie between information and action has been severed information is not a commodity that can be bought and sold or used as a form of entertainment or worn like a garment to enhance ones status it comes indiscriminately directed at no one in particular disconnected from usefulness we are glutted with information drowning in information and have no control over it dont know what to do with it
463257 let us observe how the mechanical genius of our time has diffused itself into quite other provinces not the external and physical alone is now managed by machinery but the internal and spiritual also these things which we state lightly enough here are yet of deep import and indicate a mighty change in our whole manner of existence for the same habit regulates not our modes of action alone but our modes of thought and feeling men are grown mechanical in head and in heart as well as in hand

463282 light will shine down from someone and it will light upon you and you will experience an epiphany and you will say to yourself i have to vote for barack
463283 the fact that you guys are not insulted by how low the bar has been set for politics in the past month concerns me
463284 mccain supporters who are not very religious can embrace this stuff but those mccain supporters who claim to be religious have dashingly exhibited to all of us the art of compartmentalizing and quarantining ones life faith over there political allegiance over here
463285 so we should watch mccains which pokes fun with his perception of messianism in the obama campaign in order to see that obama portrays himself as messianic anyone with half a brain knows that the interspersed words of obama were stripped on context in order to play into the model mccain builds in fact the bit about the light descending was actually a joke obama was telling at a rally about how conservative dogmatists paint him seriously i have seen plenty of religious fundamentalism outside the catholic church but i have rarely seen such political fundamentalism inside it
463286 it was the obama campaign that drilled their campaign workers to not talk about issues but rather to and i quote
463287 but only after we figured out you used several different aliases which had conversations with each other
463288 i continue to be surprised that people you are too dense to grasp that point
463289 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
463290 run a campaign attacking barack obama personally as too young too elite and too pampered to be president as opposed to attacking obamas ideas
463291 the irony of course is obama was raised by a single mother whereas mccain is the son and grandson of admirals and married a woman worth an estimated 100 million
463292 was filmed not far from the city of brooks alberta heritage park and its operational
463293 the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert redford

463355 por nuestra propia historia el atleta mexicano tiene muchas complejidades psicol gicas que no le ayudan para ser un deportista triunfador en t rminos generales un ni o que quiere ser atleta y tiene las condiciones para serlo debe sortear muchas barreras psicol gicas como puede ser la sobreprotecci n de los padres que lo podr an convertir en una persona dependiente
463356 adem s a los ni os en m xico no se les ense a a ser disciplinados por lo cual cuando llegan a la adolescencia les costar mucho trabajo someterse a las rutinas estrictas que rigen a los atletas de alto rendimiento
463357 al mexicano le cuesta mucho trabajo asumir una postura heroica porque esto implica responsabilidad y sobresalir m s que el grupo inconscientemente genera envidias por lo que es preferible permanecer homog neo y no sobresalir
463358 por definici n somos un pueblo conquistado y por ende poco valorado ante nuestros propios ojos los mexicanos poseemos baja autoestima
463359 los triunfos de los mexicanos se presentan cuando hay una buena relaci n con los entrenadores que incluso pueden ser sus padres como por ejemplo arturo e iridia salazar y lorena ochoa quienes han obtenido triunfos a nivel internacional debido a su talento y una relaci n sana con su familia

463369 x ray hologram of leonardo da vincis famous drawing vitruvian man a lithographic reproduction less than two micrometers square etched with an electron beam nanowriter the hologram required a five second exposure and had a resolution of 50 nanometers
463370 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers says stefano marchesini of the als who led the research
463371 the ancient greeks made note of pinhole camera effects without understanding them later pinhole cameras were used by chinese arab and european scholars
463372 by knowing the precise layout of a pinhole array including the different sizes of the different pinholes a computer can recover a bright high resolution image numerically
463373 advances in the development of free electron lasers offer the realistic prospect of nanoscale imaging on the timescale of atomic motions we identify x ray fourier transform holography as a promising but so far inefficient scheme to do this we show that a uniformly redundant array placed next to the sample multiplies the efficiency of x ray fourier transform holography by more than three orders of magnitude approaching that of a perfect lens and provides holographic images with both amplitude and phase contrast information

463611 miller is a fine writer who sharply addresses the details of the arguments about intelligent design creationism when tackling old chestnuts such as the only a theory complaint or michael behes argument for a maximum limit for the number of genetic mutations or william dembskis rehash of william paleys watchmaker argument for complexity miller discusses the contemporary biological explanations while refuting the errors
463612 religious leanings give him insight into both sides of the struggle
463613 opposes them uncompromisingly miller does not confuse sympathy for the intent of creationists with sympathy for its effects the conflict has wider consequences than the teaching of one discipline in us public schools the creationists aim to revise what science means discarding rationalism naturalism materialism and other enlightenment values to incorporate the supernatural and loosen the rigour of all sciences
463614 mmmm impressive but no thanks i already have a sharpie
463615 we wanted to break the format and do something different particularly after how powerful the climax was with the death of two major characters
463616 so were telling one big story in season 3 and putting the torchwood crew under a huge amount of pressure and just seeing how they cope with their numbers depleted
463617 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
463618 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
463619 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right
463620 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much
463621 but there is a tiny part of me that kind of prefers she does stay dead
463622 its a big show for bbc america and its a show they are really proud of and it works really well i dont exactly know what that means in physical numbers but it gets a lot of airtime and it gets a lot of coverage
463623 youre not special youre not powerful youre not connected youre not clever youre not important
463624 it created a tremendous buzz when it was shown in britain
463625 that was russell saying what would happen if i press every button at once
463626 said moffat who came to town with julie gardner the bbcs controller of drama commissioning and an outgoing executive producer of
463627 no use pretending its not art house its not even authored in a way its a big massive brand a bbc brand the most important show
463628 the interesting question is where to place it for that family audience
463629 it does moderately well for the sci fi channel but it transmits for a 9 p m slot which it isnt written or made for
463630 you know what were pleased with the way its been performing for us
463631 fancying people and not knowing what to do about it
463632 tosh is learning about herself coming out of her shell shes a late bloomer
463633 we were losing a team member and a part of our torchwood family
463634 you dont know a hell of a lot about him
463635 when we first met him he was not a very likable person
463636 im going to be an action hero i might get my own figure i love science fiction
463637 i thought they had far too much time on their hands
463638 therell be a ticking clock a big event and it will push the torchwood team into new territory
463639 of your fellow three panelists marry shag push off a cliff
463640 naoko no offense youre going off a the cliff but id shag her before i threw her

463643 if you buy my book the story is in there its called anything goes and it did
463644 british soldiers forced a shia militia commander to listen to pornographic videos deprived him of sleep repeatedly beat him and kept him in solitary confinement for more than five months according to fresh damning allegations against the conduct of uk troops in basra

463646 do goodbyes really exsist or do we force them on each other ive forgotten what it is to say sayonara but how many times in my life will i have to be reminded of such a feeling
463647 the funniest part is that americans have the balls and resilience to laugh in the face of horror thats why were better than canada
463648 the world is america god is america you hate us because you fear us and you are right to do so
463649 its people like you that make americans hate other countries fat lazy well lets see who fat and lazy after we kick your ass

463653 it isnt like we havent been here in two or three years we were just here six weeks ago so everybody kind of knows what to expect as far as the track goes
463654 when it clouds up it gains a lot of grip and a lot of speed when the sun breaks out it gets slick and greasy that has a lot to do with the outcome of the race and hopefully it will be just fine
463655 i think we had a pretty good baseline last time here we were pretty happy with our race car so well go back and look at those notes a lot and take what we learned yesterday with the track being a good bit different for us and try to incorporate that all into a best educated guess on what we want
463656 theres always a menu of stuff that we would like to try to improve our car like everyone else
463657 and a lot of these teams have a lot more experience here than us
463658 green party ministers should have the political integrity to stand over their position in relation to the corrib gas pipeline
463659 when the strategic infrastructure bill was making its way through the oireachtas i warned that it would be used to push through the corrib gas pipeline project without proper consultation with the community affected
463660 the decision of the department of the environment to grant planning permission without approval from an bord plean la to shell e amp p limited for a key section of the corrib onshore pipeline at glengad in county mayo shows that my concern at the time was fully warranted
463661 this decision flies in the face of local democratic accountability and the legislation used to facilitate it was designed for exactly that purpose
463662 both green party ministers should have the political integrity to stand over their position in relation to the corrib gas pipeline
463663 whenever i see someone less fortunate than dee and lets face it who isnt less fortunate than dee

463682 in den ersten beiden teilen des qualifyings f hlte sich das auto sehr gut an was man auch an den zeiten konnte danach ist es mir nicht mehr gelungen die reifen gut auf die fliegende runde vorzubereiten
463683 mir ist auf meiner letzten runde ein missgeschick passiert das einige zeit gekostet hat nachdem schon die vorherige runde nicht so gut war konsequenz war der sechste platz nat rlich bin ich nicht gl cklich damit

463692 ci sono sei alpinisti fermi sul collo di bottiglia uno caduto e ha una frattura gli altri cinque lo stanno aiutando a proseguire ma questoperazione sta rallentando di molto la discesa
463693 la montagna non vuole la morte di chi venuto per salirla e lalpinista che si rapporta con essa che determina per buona parte la propria sorte quando cerca di realizzare il proprio sogno un gioco pericoloso al limite fra rischio esperienza e destino un ottomila tuo solo quando ne sei sceso prima sei tu che gli appartieni

463798 il regno del padre come una persona che voleva uccidere un potente prima di uscire di casa sfoder la spada e la infil nel muro per provare se il suo braccio riusciva a trapassarlo poi uccise il potente

463940 we have more than a decades worth of evidence that congestion pricing works from californias two pioneering priced lane projects on i 15 in san diego and on sr 91 in orange county transportation planners from around the country have visited those projects and are now doing likewise in seattle san francisco salt lake city denver minneapolis houston dallas miami and soon in the virginia suburbs of washington dc
463941 the san francisco bay areas long range transportation plan calls for a seamless network of hot lanes throughout silicon valley and the east bay a recent study by parsons brinckerhoff and econorthwest found that the projected system if in place by 2018 under a rapid delivery option would save travelers 75 million vehicle hours a year by 2030
463942 network twentyone it also ignores the fact that most people who click on amway com probably also click on other links as well
463943 bsm material made serious misrepresentations in relation to a key part of amways business
463944 amway bears direct responsibility for the statements which it approved or which it failed to subject to a proper review process to ensure actual compliance with the position formally stated on paper
463945 which recommends against anyone with any connection with a company from directly editing articles related to that company
463946 if a rule prevents you from improving or maintaining wikipedia ignore it
463947 working in the field of human behavior ive studied the cults for many years
463948 the old myth that amway is a cult is supported only by people who are either misinformed or uninformed i would like to examine their research

463956 he wouldnt have run the gop ad but i am not going to referee i am just going to run my own campaign
463957 i cant be a referee of every spot run on television

463960 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
463961 what were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
463962 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about

463971 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical

463975 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
463976 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
463977 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
463978 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
463979 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
463980 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
463981 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent

463986 system loss is not and should not be a vatable item it need not be emphasized that system loss as the term implies is a loss that arises from technical inefficiency it should not be subjected to vat because these do not form any part of electricity consumed
463987 the country has the second highest electricity rate in southeast asia it has been said that our high power cost weakens our economic efficiency as a nation and our capability to attract and retain foreign investment
463988 gross receipts shall exclude system losses which the distribution utility may collect from its consumers it further provides that such system losses collected by the distribution utility shall not be subject to any vat
463989 the proposed exclusion of system loss from the term gross receipts and its exemption from vat are aimed at alleviating the effects of increasing electricity costs which have already reached monumental heights with the increasing electricity rates coupled with the high cost of gasoline and other basic commodities the ordinary filipino can no longer cope with the cost of everyday living

463994 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
463995 sitting at home in his mothers basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons amp dragons
463996 sen john mccain of arizona is the only republican who promises to end the george bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
463997 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
463998 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper
463999 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
464000 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances
464001 for starters their editorials are decidedly liberal thats a no brainer and there are often complaints that even their general reporting is biased in subtle and not so subtle ways the new york times has come to be associated with the northeast liberal establishment

464007 our grandfather thought frank was a point of connection a bridge if you will to the larger african american experience for my brother
464008 frank was part of a group of black vanguard intellectuals
464009 the people that he came into contact with throughout his life like richard wright and margaret walker were very significant
464010 you could get a lot of strength from a person like frank who had suffered all the discrimination that a black man goes through in america
464011 mccarthy era strategy of smear tactics and condemnation by association
464012 writings of frank marshall davis a voice of the black press
464013 he made his vision into a beacon a light shedding understanding and enlightenment on the problems that denied people regardless of race national origin or economic status their constitutional rights
464014 with his books and whiskey breath and the hint of hard earned knowledge behind the hooded eyes
464015 such a wonderful person a strong hearted person just gone so quickly and tragically he was just always a jokester its just a terrible loss to the whole community the southern tier and he touched many lives
464016 the energy efficiency targets will have the practical on the ground effect of avoiding the need to build nine giant power plants and reducing pollution equivalent to the emissions produced by 2 8 million cars by 2020 nrdc estimates these electricity and natural gas savings will bolster the states economy by providing at least 7 billion in net benefits through 2020 from energy bill savings and the avoided costs of building new infrastructure

464240 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate

464243 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
464244 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper

464252 im advocating a program that would see state governments accept the inevitable with ministries reduced to five and state mps serving on a part time basis
464253 there has been a devastating leaching of state government powers to the commonwealth i dont think its a good thing but sadly it is irreversible
464254 meanwhile the national government has clawed indigenous affairs off the states and territories and might as well be making all the decisions in this area
464255 and its hard to see much autonomy left in health policy for the states after the current review
464256 apart from police the one area where they are likely to continue to have real autonomy is in land use planning implementing capital city plans controlling rivers and native vegetation running most national parks making forestry decisions

464258 as premier for 10 years i saw canberra win every showdown with the states

464286 the people that he came into contact with throughout his life like richard wright and margaret walker were very significant

464294 in reality seeks to modify the social and cultural reality of spain transforming its identity
464295 this social and cultural project aims to construct a secular society without any moral or religious reference attempting to impose nihilist thought and deliberately eliminating everything catholic from public life
464296 powerful and sometimes dark forces present everywhere from the media to schools
464297 thus the church is presented as the enemy of democracy and modernization opposed to science and progress against freedom the enemy of happiness or the promoter of division confrontation and violence in an effort to isolate religion to private life
464298 the silencing of god is the fundamental event of our times
464299 there is nothing else that compares in terms of its radicalism and serious consequences
464300 nothing can be said to be definitive it is at the center of a society that constantly doubts itself there is no law only rights that are restricted or broadened according to the will of whoever is in power in all of this is the concept of man as a being autonomous of the will of god who counts for nothing

464310 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while said julie scofield executive director of the national alliance of state and territorial aids directors
464311 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place said the expert david holtgrave of johns hopkins university
464312 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic said dr julie gerberding the cdcs director she said other countries may adopt the agencys methodology
464313 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
464314 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic said julie davids executive director of the community hiv aids mobilization project
464315 wake up call to scale things up said dr kevin fenton who oversees cdcs prevention efforts for hiv aids
464316 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up said former u s surgeon general dr david satcher who is now an administrator at atlantas morehouse school of medicine
464317 these are extremely complicated statistical methods and cdc officials wanted the work to be thoroughly reviewed by outside experts gerberding said
464318 spirituality was always an innate part of our lives in the west of ireland and this pilgrimage is steeped in our traditions and heritage
464319 but when major events like the galway races are held on the same day it can take peoples focus off pilgrimages like this

464348 my granddaughter said the explosion occurred when someone turned the lights on
464349 a strong whistling sound came up from the ground floor
464350 very disappointed that the investigation into bailey s death has not made any progress
464351 instead the case has become more complicated as aspects surrounding the motives for bailey s murder have been unleashed evidence some recorded by the police and some uncovered by investigative reporters points at someone other than the currently accused defendant broussard as a potential perpetrator s and or mastermind s of the crime and suggests that local police officials may be protecting those responsible for mr bailey s death

464356 it isnt like we havent been here in two or three years we were just here six weeks ago so everybody kind of knows what to expect as far as the track goes
464357 this track does swing a lot weather related when it clouds up it gains a lot of grip and a lot of speed and when the sun breaks it gets slick and greasy that has a lot to do with the outcome of the race and hopefully it will be just fine
464358 they tell me that they are in no hurry they havent got any plan to sell and last time i spoke to them i said what if a sovereign wealth fund came along with a huge amount of money they said they would be tempted but they say they dont have any plans to sell it
464359 they want to stabilise it and i dont know this but i suspect that part of it will be where bernie has been replaced if someone wanted to buy it at the moment then the whole business depends on a man who is 78 years ago
464360 we have no plans to sell our stake in formula one
464361 we see our investment as long term and we are pleased with its performance to date
464362 the formula one group continues to be led by bernie ecclestone
464363 something similar happened in turkey we just sat there and lost time before we could get the engine going and start driving
464364 theres a great harmony within the team at the moment and we really deserved this i couldnt ask to be in a better position weve both got good strategies for tomorrow and well be challenging for the win
464365 it was difficult to choose the right tyre for the final session and i felt i could have done a slightly faster lap in q3 but i was a little cautious in turn two still weve found a great direction with the car and ive got a great opportunity to win the race tomorrow
464366 its fantastic to be starting on the front row alongside lewis i hope that starting on the dirty side of the track wont be a disadvantage and i fully expect us to look out for each other in the first corner tomorrow this result really repays the team for all its efforts over the past few months
464367 todays all vodafone mclaren mercedes front row is a fitting tribute to the phenomenal amount of hard work carried out by the whole team in the lead up to the 2008 hungarian grand prix
464368 a qualifying one two is a rare and pleasing achievement so i want to say a big thank you to all the people who worked so hard to make it possible and that includes everyone in woking mclaren in brixworth mercedes benz highperformanceengines and of course in stuttgart mercedes benz now we hope to convert our excellent qualifying performance into an equally solid race result
464369 the system has found a problem on your machine and cannot continue

464464 a lot of people screw up in their lives and leave and their parents slam the door in their face when they come back
464465 he was the last person i expected to be a priest
464466 when you think of a priest you think quiet and studious robert was so rebellious
464467 knowing father masseo im sure hell be dealing with a lot of problems facing young people such as drugs gangs and teen pregnancy
464468 hell be an important part of a lot of baptisms first communions and confirmations those will be his children
464469 im not going to stop gangs and i didnt create them
464470 they exist just like they exist in the regular hispanic community they exist in the homie world
464471 god blessed me with all this artistic talent for that job in life
464472 worked the barrio for about 20 years and knows all the homies by name
464473 acts like a second father to many of the homies
464474 my life would probably be a lot more boring without the homies
464475 if i hadnt written to you so long ago my life may have turned out differently and i could have been just another statistic just another face on the welfare line
464476 he helped the homie family stay on the right path
464477 it was reaffirming for me and it let me know that i had not gone too bad
464478 my granddaughter said the explosion occurred when someone turned the lights on

464495 many national democrats consider ritter a cipher with little reputation outside colorado but ritters story of personal struggle missionary service in zambia and environmental leadership would appeal broadly
464496 gov ritter has not been asked and its not anything he thinks about
464497 bill ritter loves being governor of colorado because its the best job in america
464498 i think there is a big reason theres an age difference in a lot of these polls because once youve reached a certain age you wont sit there and listen to somebody tell you theres really no difference between what happened in the bush years and the clinton years that theres not much difference in how small town pennsylvania fared when i was president and in this decade
464499 every time after there had been bombing they would take the people to see the craters terrified and half crazy the people were ready to believe what they were told it was because of their dissatisfaction with the bombing that they kept on co operating with the khmer rouge joining up with the khmer rouge sending their children off to go with them
464500 the non muslims are unjust and have killed our people and children by bombing them and thats why i started jihad against them they have killed hundreds of our people and thats why i want to fight against them
464501 using damage caused by b 52 strikes as the main theme of their propaganda
464502 inadequate co ordination between military and civilian programs for security stabilization reconstruction and development
464503 these and other deficiencies reflect serious failures of strategic direction
464504 for best effect all three components of the strategy military diplomatic and development need to reinforce each other
464505 toronto star oped 2011 is a date not a goal
464506 sure i won less votes but its the electoral votes that matter
464507 as i mentioned since the nomination is chosen by the delegates not pop vote then obama clearly has the high ground in this argument
464508 obama has the high ground because technically popular vote isnt what counts
464509 its undemocratic of the super delegates to overrule the will of the people as expressed in the delegate count but its entirely acceptable for the super delegates to overrule the will of the people as expressed by the popular vote
464510 barak obama has said we should let the people decide well i agree and more of the people have voted for me
464511 ich bin mir nicht sicher ob es ein schriftliches dokument daf r gibt aber ich wei andererseits dass holbrooke auf h chster ebene m ndliche garantien f r karadzic abgegeben hat
464512 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
464513 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
464514 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
464515 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
464516 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
464517 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
464518 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
464519 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
464520 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
464521 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
464522 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
464523 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
464524 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
464525 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
464526 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
464527 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
464528 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
464529 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
464530 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
464531 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
464532 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
464533 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
464534 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
464535 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
464536 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
464537 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
464538 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
464539 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
464540 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
464541 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
464542 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
464543 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
464544 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
464545 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
464546 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
464547 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
464548 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
464549 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
464550 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
464551 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
464552 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
464553 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
464554 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
464555 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
464556 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
464557 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
464558 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
464559 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
464560 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
464561 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
464562 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
464563 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
464564 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
464565 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
464566 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
464567 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
464568 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
464569 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
464570 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
464571 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
464572 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
464573 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
464574 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
464575 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
464576 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
464577 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
464578 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
464579 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
464580 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
464581 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
464582 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
464583 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
464584 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
464585 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
464586 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
464587 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
464588 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
464589 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
464590 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
464591 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
464592 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
464593 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
464594 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
464595 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
464596 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
464597 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
464598 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
464599 who are open to doing something on the production side
464600 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
464601 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
464602 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

464945 made false promises that people would save money used tough pressure tactics to sell travel packages claiming high upfront fees and then failed to provide services and refused to let customers cancel orders
464946 let me be clear no way do i think john mccains campaign was being racist i think they are cynical
464947 i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
464948 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
464949 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
464950 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
464951 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
464952 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
464953 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
464954 i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons

464956 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
464957 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
464958 weve got to make sure we keep focused on peoples day to day concerns we dont take the skill of the republicans in engaging in negative campaigning lightly
464959 at some point people are going to have to make decisions are we going to keep arguing or are we going to get things done
464960 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good
464961 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to

465001 when the car came over the bridge and crashed it was the only car on that side of the road
465002 thats the information from witnesses who were going the other way
465003 earlier on in the night there was an allegation the car was being followed which obviously is still part of the big investigation
465004 the two cars were seen by police in pinjarra before it had actually been reported stolen
465005 there was nothing untoward with the cars that would have caused the police at that point to turn around and follow the cars and try to apprehend them
465006 this investigation involves looking at everything that happened including all calls received by police
465007 so while major crash has been conducting that investigation on behalf of the coroner police have also looked at the actions of officers involved in taking those calls
465008 police are looking at how a call taker responded to the call he received
465009 you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control
465010 and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement
465011 you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control
465012 im advocating a program that would see state governments accept the inevitable with ministries reduced to five and state mps serving on a part time basis
465013 there has been a devastating leaching of state government powers to the commonwealth i dont think its a good thing but sadly it is irreversible
465014 meanwhile the national government has clawed indigenous affairs off the states and territories and might as well be making all the decisions in this area
465015 and its hard to see much autonomy left in health policy for the states after the current review
465016 apart from police the one area where they are likely to continue to have real autonomy is in land use planning implementing capital city plans controlling rivers and native vegetation running most national parks making forestry decisions

465019 my sister kindly offered to be my surrogate she already has a family and we didnt think it was any big deal
465020 our families are 100 per cent behind us and so initially we thought theres no reason why we cant do this but it turns out there is a big reason
465021 my sister and her husband both need to be made sterile it is crazy
465022 rushed through and not all the implications were thought about
465023 they didnt actually make surrogacy illegal but they made it bloody difficult
465024 it is fairly bizarre that you ask the surrogate who you would expect to be fertile to be infertile and that you expect her partner to also be infertile
465025 it actually discriminates against people who want to do surrogacy and its affected couples since technology allowed surrogacy
465026 i just dont understand why if were an infertile couple we cant access the same help as everybody else

465041 we may then have to look prospectively to see what interventions work in reversing this trend

465057 murali muttiah muralitharan will come to the party its just that in these couple of days theyve batted well against him
465058 when the indians batted first on that wicket keeping them to 329 was a brilliant effort the wicket was playing really well
465059 we had kumar sangakkara and malinda warnapura giving us a great start but we could not capitalise on that
465060 ideally if we had got a lead it would have been brilliant but i thought harbhajan bowled very well the previous day to pick up thilan samaraweera and tillakaratne dilshan and straight away put us on the back foot
465061 after that our target was to try and get close to the indian total which we fell short they got a good start again but we managed to pull them back its an evenly balanced test match if we can get a couple of early wickets tomorrow and put pressure on the indians
465062 even on the first day ajantha mendis turned the ball so did murali muttiah muralitharan and then harbhajan on the second day but you still need to put the ball in the right areas
465063 if you are really determined you can survive and get into a rhythm and its quite easy to score runs it is a good test wicket
465064 out of the first six batters harbhajan got five of the top order and that speaks for itself a few of our guys were a bit too cautious but you should give credit to harbhajan the way he bowled
465065 most of the guys got out to good balls not that they threw away their wickets
465066 india were batting cautiously as well as they were attacking at different times with murali we tried to get wickets early
465067 because of that he probably gave away a few loose ones and i brought him on with the new ball thinking that i can create an opportunity but it didnt happen and it was not ideal for him when you have a top spinner like him the batsmen tend to bat cautiously
465068 murali will come to the party its just that in these couple of days theyve batted well against him
465069 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
465070 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
465071 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story

465152 solche politischen s uberungsaktionen die in diktatorischen regimen wie in china an der tagesordnung sind d rfen im demokratischen deutschland keinen platz haben
465153 es ist richtig dass ein gro teil der medien und auch ein gewisser teil der spd den rauswurf f r ein lautes gezeter nutzen aber auch einen clement mit parteibuch h tten sie permanent benutzt auch zur st rkung ihrer position in der spd

465263 she told us that in fact they didnt know that tim was the victim in this crime until last night when a journalist came to their house and knocked on the door
465264 obviously theyre wondering why the rcmp did not come and inform the family for such a long time
465265 then to get the knock on the door and to find out that its your son its your brother i cant imagine how it must have been for them and that shock is written on their faces
465266 tims sister told us the family feels they really cant say a word not even to speak about tims life until they can assemble the family together and they can come up with a joint statement
465267 the one thing that i noticed about tim was that he never took anything seriously
465268 i dont think tim is the type of person to take any crap from anyone
465269 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all

465279 we had a meeting last monday with gareth and his agent at which we all agreed we would have a 5pm deadline on wednesday and if liverpool had not proved they had the wherewithal to proceed with the transfer deal then we would all leave that aside and go on with it oneill said
465280 i was hoping that would be the case and this was not a matter of liverpool missing the deadline by 15 minutes as seems to have been reported
465281 so ive listened to what theyve said and ill go with it reluctantly but ill go with it there will be no deadline and liverpool have all the time in the world now to sign gareth barry theyve got up to the normal window which is the 31st of this month so its really up to them gareth and his agent to sort it out ive decided this is the only way forward for us really i have a football club to run and i want people who want to play for us if liverpool at the end of it all do not come up with the money thats no one elses fault but their own id be delighted if that was the case and gareth stayed but i would doubt that very much the ball is very much in their court

465360 my fiance is a great guy very polite and considerate and all kinds of good catch material the issue is his eating of the garlic he loves garlic and when he cooks yes he cooks really well he puts it in everything at least it seems like it i dont get to eat with him all the time as we dont live together yet so im forever dealing with the garlic breath issue in his defense he doesnt always know when we will be seeing each other and i often just pop in unexpectedly so he cant really plan not to eat it all the time but sometimes he can and he doesnt do i have a right to tell him not to eat it

465364 i cant tell kids not to throw rocks in the water thats like asking them not to be children and how are they going to learn to love nature and the natural world around them if they cant ever touch it or be a part of it kids throwing rocks in the water has probably been a natural part of water life since the first child stood up on two legs those bureaucrats just dont know what theyre doing
465365 play is the primary mechanism through which children engage and connect with the world and natural environments are particularly attractive inspiring and satisfying for kids something magical occurs when children and wild spaces mix

465389 i used to be shy but i cant be shy now because everyone knows me in entropia and ive also done a lot of public relations for the game
465390 im advocating a program that would see state governments accept the inevitable with ministries reduced to five and state mps serving on a part time basis
465391 there has been a devastating leaching of state government powers to the commonwealth i dont think its a good thing but sadly it is irreversible
465392 meanwhile the national government has clawed indigenous affairs off the states and territories and might as well be making all the decisions in this area
465393 and its hard to see much autonomy left in health policy for the states after the current review
465394 apart from police the one area where they are likely to continue to have real autonomy is in land use planning implementing capital city plans controlling rivers and native vegetation running most national parks making forestry decisions

465397 when the car came over the bridge and crashed it was the only car on that side of the road
465398 thats the information from witnesses who were going the other way
465399 earlier on in the night there was an allegation the car was being followed which obviously is still part of the big investigation
465400 the two cars were seen by police in pinjarra before it had actually been reported stolen
465401 there was nothing untoward with the cars that would have caused the police at that point to turn around and follow the cars and try to apprehend them
465402 this investigation involves looking at everything that happened including all calls received by police
465403 so while major crash has been conducting that investigation on behalf of the coroner police have also looked at the actions of officers involved in taking those calls
465404 police are looking at how a call taker responded to the call he received
465405 my sister kindly offered to be my surrogate she already has a family and we didnt think it was any big deal

465407 my sister and her husband both need to be made sterile it is crazy
465408 rushed through and not all the implications were thought about
465409 they didnt actually make surrogacy illegal but they made it bloody difficult
465410 it is fairly bizarre that you ask the surrogate who you would expect to be fertile to be infertile and that you expect her partner to also be infertile
465411 it actually discriminates against people who want to do surrogacy and its affected couples since technology allowed surrogacy
465412 i just dont understand why if were an infertile couple we cant access the same help as everybody else

465457 if a completely bogus claim that environmental protection is raising energy prices can get this much political traction what are the chances of getting serious action against global warming after all a cap and trade system would in effect be a tax on carbon though mr mccain apparently doesnt know that and really would raise energy prices

465477 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
465478 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
465479 the scientific community is really going to run with this
465480 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

465485 i have always had a dread of becoming a passenger in life
465486 very disappointed that the investigation into baileys death has not made any progress
465487 instead the case has become more complicated as aspects surrounding the motives for baileys murder have been unleashed evidence some recorded by the police and some uncovered by investigative reporters points at someone other than the currently accused defendant broussard as a potential perpetrator s and or mastermind s of the crime and suggests that local police officials may be protecting those responsible for mr baileys death
465488 conduct an independent investigation and assume the prosecution of those responsible for the murder of chauncey bailey
465489 i have no question whatsoever that my office can prosecute this case professionally and competently
465490 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
465491 thats such a shame especially for the ones who were clean and its most important for the athletes who were second
465492 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it
465493 athletes will have full rights to express themselves as they wish
465494 we are simply asking them not to get into propaganda exercises
465495 if we allow demonstrations in the village or the stadium thats the end of all harmony
465496 im adamant there was no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
465497 im not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for
465498 the ioc asked for the fullest access and this is what the beijing organizing committee said it would deliver
465499 i have absolutely no concern for the organization absolutely i have no regrets
465500 i was really impressed with it and im so excited to see that shes releasing it cant wait to re read it

465522 that obama is likely enjoying in a twisted way the public debate and analysis over his birth certificate that has mushroomed into a netroot obsession
465523 demanding that sen barack obama show america a certified copy of his complete and original birth certificate bc by august 1
465524 developing an exclusive article about eligibility to be potus in the event that a candidate has ever been a dual citizen of the us and other countries

465527 im right im right im right im right im right
465528 his mother was promiscuous and had a child out of wedlock in 1961 when that was still scandalous behavior is this obamas idea of family values obviously he has been deceiving the american people and hoping his advertising lies could overcome the truth he has failed
465529 if these are different people using the same email address then they seem to share political opinions

465539 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
465540 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
465541 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
465542 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
465543 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
465544 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up

465599 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
465600 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
465601 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
465602 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
465603 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
465604 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

465622 no airline has a more consistent and methodical commitment than continental to improve the customer experience and that focus will continue and expand long after my departure
465623 we realize that theres more and more demands in this business at this level
465624 in order to get the job done you need many people doing it so its really as simple as that
465625 in my estimation and many people in hockey feel the same way steves the strongest candidate in hockey at the executive level who wasnt a general manager

465633 you can be retired for the rest of your life youll know when youre done
465634 if youre not 100 per cent certain that you dont want to play anymore then the decision is that you should be playing
465635 people always told me play as long as you can i think these guys youre talking about still have some good years left in them
465636 i think guys want to be certain and just do it once
465637 you look at what brett favre is going through right now its better when you make the decision just to do it one time

465639 he really felt that he was at a point in his life where he really wanted time to do other things and felt like he was missing out a little bit
465640 i think once he took half a year off he realized that those things will be there when hockeys over
465641 i wouldnt be surprised if he ends up playing again after this contract
465642 i loved playing the game and everything about it if i could have remained healthy and trained and what not i wouldve kept playing
465643 once i had done it i felt really good about it
465644 i knew it was the right decision at that time
465645 i think this is a good opportunity at this stage of my career and it wouldnt have been possible without the experience and success we had in spokane
465646 im excited about the opportunity with the chicago blackhawks organization in meeting with them i felt good about the direction their team is going it is an organization in the upswing and i was impressed with the people particularly dale tallon stan bowman and john mcdonough

465674 in each cell in our body there is a genetic program which causes programmed cell death when something goes wrong the cells divide with no control and become cancer cells in normal cells when the cell discovers that the control system is not operating correctly for example when it recognizes that a cell contains faulty genetic material following cell division it triggers cell death

465676 ive tried every remedy but nothing seems to work for me
465677 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
465678 listen unless you give me anwr youll never drive again
465679 we shall have world government whether or not you like it by conquest or consent
465680 the drive of the rockefellers and their allies is to create a one world government combining super capitalism and communism under the same tent all under their control do i mean conspiracy yes i do i am convinced there is such a plot international in scope generations old in planning and incredibly evil in intent
465681 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
465682 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
465683 lets get folks spun about someones perception of obamas comments without bothering to actually report what he said
465684 if we come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise where i have to accept some things that i dont like in order to get energy independence thats something i will have to consider
465685 fine you can drill offshore but every drop that comes out the ground must go right back into the u s market
465686 fine ill give him a chance to impress me as it looks he might be the one selected by the media plus i guess if the dems want to win they might as well pick the more charismatic corporatist candidate
465687 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term
465688 okay lets drill now what oh yeah that doesnt do anything what else you got oh yeah nothing now lets get back to work actually solving the problem
465689 an act to authorize and direct the secretary of energy to sell the alaska power administration and to authorize the export of alaska north slope crude oil
465690 obama suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas
465691 my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
465692 do you know my name i doubt if you do
465693 chefes de pol cia n o deveriam se envolver em nada que diga respeito vida pessoal de outras pessoas inapropriado
465694 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
465695 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue so i applaud them on that but i am not ready to sign off on any particular approach or proposal because i think these are very important issues
465696 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that you know i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
465697 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
465698 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
465699 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
465700 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
465701 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
465702 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
465703 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional offshore drilling is wrong
465704 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
465705 i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
465706 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
465707 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
465708 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
465709 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
465710 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
465711 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
465712 i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons
465713 im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i dont have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
465714 youve got statistics that say weve lost another 50 000 jobs that florida is in a recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about was paris and britney
465715 theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
465716 weve got to make sure we keep focused on peoples day to day concerns we dont take the skill of the republicans in engaging in negative campaigning lightly
465717 at some point people are going to have to make decisions are we going to keep arguing or are we going to get things done
465718 what i dont want to do is for the best to be the enemy of the good
465719 and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to
465720 are you better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago
465721 can you afford another four years of george bushs economic policies its time to restore fairness and balance to the american economy
465722 we face serious issues in this election and have real differences
465723 im not going to assault sen mccains character im not going to compare him to pop stars i will however compare our two visions for our economic future

465832 the land of the free and the home of the brave
465833 governments that use torture intend to intimidate their citizens in order to maintain control those who are tortured become examples of the consequences of dissent
465834 specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering
465835 not be exposed even to the risk of an investigation and expensive legal bills
465836 but but but we have jack the ripper sitting right here he confessed it all and the attack on the hindenburg and youre gonna let him walk
465837 a number of hessians and waldeckers have fallen into our hands the german officers and soldiers by a finesse of the british to increase their ferocity had been led to believe that americans are savages and barbarians and if taken would have their bodies stuck full of pieces of dry wood and in that manner burnt to death but they were very agreeably disappointed and much pleased on meeting civil and kind treatment
465838 we found lots of evidence of torture of physical and sexual abuse just deplorable conditions
465839 the rats were the size of chihuahuas and the juveniles were being housed 50 to a cell
465840 and then they would take me back to the interrogation room again another set of questions and the beating starts again and again on the third day the beating was the worst they beat me a lot with the cable and they wanted me to confess that i have been to afghanistan this was a big surprise to me because even the americans who interviewed me the fbi officials who interviewed me did not ask me that question i ended up falsely confessing in order to stop the torture the torture decreased in intensity the first 10 days of my stay in syria was extremely harsh and during that period i found my cell to be a refuge i didnt want to see their faces but later on living in that cell was horrible and just to give you an idea about how painful it is to stay in that place i was ready after a couple of months i was ready to sign any piece of document for me not to be released just to go to another place where it is fit for human being
465841 who me war crime nonsense it was underlings thats it it was underlings yeah yeah sure sure underlings right
465842 dont you guys get it we are above the law
465843 he confessed didnt he thats all i need to know
465844 hey it was an honest mistake that cabinet we were keeping the tapes in well turns out it wasnt a cabinet after all it was a large industrial degaussing unit weird huh i guess its been here since the nixon years and everybody forgot what it did when you closed the doors honest besides there wasnt anything important on those tapes just a bunch of guys screaming their heads off and saying all kinds of nonsensical things to get us to turn the electricity off
465845 legacies will be that of the legitimization of torture both domestically and abroad
465846 he is rarely referenced as one of the usual suspects
465847 the minute the military lawyers expressed concern they were shut down
465848 should any american soldier be so base and infamous as to injure any prisoner i do most earnestly enjoin you to bring him to such severe and exemplary punishment as the enormity of the crime may require should it extend to death itself it will not be disproportional to its guilt at such a time and in such a cause for by such conduct they bring shame disgrace and ruin to themselves and their country
465849 no american should think were free the war is over al qaeda is not coming and theyre not interested in getting us
465850 this report tells the largely untold human story of what happened to detainees in our custody when the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture this story is not only written in words it is scrawled for the rest of these individuals lives on their bodies and minds our national honor is stained by the indignity and inhumane treatment these men received from their captors
465851 provid ed assistance to an element of the intelligence community in connection with intelligence activity involving communications that was i authorized by the president during the period beginning on september 11 2001 and ending on january 17 2007 and ii designed to prevent or detect a terrorist attack or activities in preparation of a terrorist attack against the united states and b the subject of a written request or directive indicating that the activity was i authorized by the president and ii determined to be lawful
465852 numerous incidents of sadistic blatant and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on several detainees
465853 we may need to curb the harsher operations while icrc is around it is better not to expose them to any controversial techniques
465854 he was not an enemy of the government he was a friend of the government
465855 the fbi believed that these techniques were not getting actionable information that they were unsophisticated and unproductive
465856 they raised their concerns with the department of defense but the department of defense from what we were told dismissed those concerns and that no changes were made in the department of defenses strategy
465857 the good news is that the prisoner did confess to shooting down the hindenburg this proves the value of our aggressive methods
465858 i stayed for more than nine month in prison accused of something i didnt do
465859 more likely than not that arar would be tortured if he was returned to his birthplace rather than canada his country of residence
465860 you dont ever ever ever want a system like this to be thought of as a torture weapon
465861 even a cursory glance at these heavily redacted documents shows that the cia is still withholding a great deal of information that should be released
465862 this information is being withheld not for legitimate security reasons but rather to shield government officials who ought to be held accountable for their decisions to break the law
465863 well exactly what is it that she did that is bad
465864 what did she do that is bad are you joking
465865 how do you get past that the smile just look at it come on
465866 freed from guantanamo in 2006 after a personal plea from german chancellor angela merkel
465867 they stuck my head into a bucket of water and punched me in the stomach
465868 there is a huge number of secret prisoners being held in iraq and one of the intriguing aspects of this that doesnt get much reporting is that the us is bringing people into iraq from elsewhere to hold them there simply because that keeps the media and lawyers away from the prisoners so they cant get any sort of legal rights
465869 evidence linking these israelis to 9 11 is classified i cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered its classified information
465870 our country for the first time in my life time has abandoned the basic principle of human rights
465871 weve said that the geneva conventions do not apply to those people in abu ghraib prison and guantanamo and weve said we can torture prisoners and deprive them of an accusation of a crime to which they are accused
465872 the documents reveal that psychologists and medical personnel played a key role in sustaining prisoner abuse a clear violation of their ethical and legal obligations
465873 the documents only underscore the need for an independent investigation into responsibility for the systemic abuse of detainees held in u s custody abroad
465874 and it works just last week we identified jack the ripper
465875 they seem to think it is worth throwing the honour of 220 years of american decency in war out of the window waterboarding is out and out torture and im deeply ashamed president bush has authorised its use and dragged the uss reputation into the mud
465876 haynes and rumsfeld had been able to run rings around him
465877 at the end of the day however dick myers was not a very powerful chairman in the first place one reason rumsfeld recommended him for the job
465878 haynes feith yoo bybee gonzalez and at the apex addington should never travel outside the us except perhaps to saudi arabia and israel they broke the law they violated their professional ethical code in future some government may build the case necessary to prosecute them in a foreign court or in an international court
465879 prisoner 345 an arab journalists five years in guant namo
465880 sami was a prisoner in the bush administrations assault on al jazeera
465881 in 1947 the u s sentenced a japanese military officer yukio asano to 15 years of hard labor for using a form of water boarding
465882 complicity in establishing the policy that led to the torture of prisoners
465883 two soldiers sat on my back while i was kneeling which caused me great pain i felt i was going to suffocate
465884 i pushed my back up which made the two soldiers hit the cars roof the soldiers started punishing me for it by hitting my head with rifle butts they only stopped when they noticed blood was gushing out of my head then they started beating me heavily in the ribs
465885 i was in severe pain and could not walk when they ordered me out of the jeep so they started kicking and hitting me all over my body till i dropped to the floor
465886 that donald rumsfeld david addington and john yoo should not leave the united states anytime soon they will be at some point indicted for war crimes
465887 people who should know better like yourself siding with the assholes to put it crudely
465888 you could almost see their dicks getting hard as they got new ideas
465889 some of the worst things that happened you dont know about okay videos um there are women there some of you may have read that they were passing letters out communications out to their men this is at abu ghraib the women were passing messages out saying please come and kill me because of whats happened and basically what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys children in cases that have been recorded the boys were sodomized with the cameras rolling and the worst above all of that is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking that your government has they are in total terror its going to come out
465890 the canadian government is refusing to use testimony from alleged al qaeda leader abu zubaydah now at guantanamo bay in its prosecution of two terror suspects because the testimony was acquired during cia interrogations in which zubaydah was waterboarded
465891 i witnessed one detainee rolling around in the mud being kicked again and again
465892 i saw the interrogator pouring water on his face waterboarding him and another detainee was standing there with a bag over his head and was forced to carry a huge rock until he couldnt do it anymore and collapsed that image seared itself into my minds eye and i cant forget it i wont forget it
465893 the abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib was de facto united states policy the authorization of torture and the decriminalization of cruel inhuman and degrading treatment of captives in wartime have been among the defining legacies of the current administration and the rules of interrogation that produced the abuses documented on the m i military intelligence block in the fall of 2003 were the direct expression of the hostility toward international law and military doctrine that was found in the white house the office and at the highest levels of the justice and defense departments
465894 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
465895 i dont think we had nearly the effect we had hoped for
465896 hey it was good enough for the nazis and the spanish inquisition so its goldanged good enough for me
465897 this is an extremely valuable interrogation technique which has allowed us to identify many criminals this soggy fellow right here for example has already confessed to shooting down columbia challenger and the hindenberg and this soggy guy here has admitted that he is jack the ripper
465898 in sum at the core of plaintiffs case against defendant jeppesen are allegations of covert us military or cia operations in foreign countries against foreign nationals clearly a subject matter which is a state secret
465899 hell we outsource darn near everything else these days why not torture using the services of folks who really know how to make it work
465900 and anyone who disagrees can go quail hunting with me
465901 ive been proud to stand by bush by the decisions hes made
465902 if its good enough for the nazis and the inquisition its good enough for us also its very effective at washing away the blood from those umm other things
465903 theres just no doubt in my mind under any set of rules waterboarding is torture
465904 alternative set of interrogation procedures that are safe and necessary
465905 if it ever is determined to be torture there will be a huge penalty to be paid for anyone engaging in it
465906 because the plaintiffs are aliens and were located outside sovereign united states territory at the time their alleged rfra claim arose they do not fall with the definition of person
465907 government shall not substantially burden a persons exercise of religion
465908 im still a little bit shocked by it all but im gratified and glad that general rowe saw it for what it really is
465909 i dont know if any officer needed to be held accountable but i obviously dont believe it should have been me
465910 it is still even after the last seven year a crime to torture suspects
465911 once he got to guantanamo bay far from receiving the palliative care that this history of torture would call for he has faced on going mistreatment held in solitary confinement in a supermax prison physically abused and deprived of any meaningful treatment please do not let the us military public relations delude anybody as the prison he is in is harsher than any of the many death row prisons i have visited in the past 25 years
465912 i dont have confidence in anything he says because once you go down that road everything you say is tainted
465913 he was talking before they did that to him but they didnt believe him the problem is they didnt realize he didnt know all that much
465914 the main reason the tool has been missing in action is public perception with memories of the abu ghraib prison scandal still fresh the pentagon is reluctant to give troops a space age device that could be misconstrued as a torture machine
465915 some of the worst things that happened you dont know about okay videos um there are women there some of you may have read that they were passing letters out communications out to their men this is at abu ghraib the women were passing messages out saying please come and kill me because of whats happened and basically what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys children in cases that have been recorded the boys were sodomized with the cameras rolling and the worst above all of that is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking that your government has they are in total terror its going to come out
465916 acknowledged that pelosi did not raise objections at the time
465917 were they ever to leak they would permit identification of your cia colleagues who had served in the programme exposing them and their families to retaliation from al qaida and its sympathisers
465918 evidence linking these israelis to 9 11 is classified i cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered its classified information
465919 he is to be released in approximately six to eight weeks
465920 i was kidnapped not knowing anything of my fate with continuous torture and interrogation for the whole of two years
465921 when i told them the truth i was tortured and beaten
465922 the good news is that we have obtained confessions from the al qaeda agents responsible for stealing socks from american dryers proving that our methods as distasteful as they may be are effective
465923 document and educate the israeli public and policymakers about human rights violations in the occupied territories combat the phenomenon of denial prevalent among the israeli public and help create a human rights culture in israel
465924 absolute prohibition the torture and ill treatment of palestinian detainees
465925 does not as a rule comment on allegations regarding who has or has not been in its custody
465926 has determined that as a sitting judge and former prosecutor it is improper for you to testify about matters still pending in the military court system and you are not to appear before the committee to testify tomorrow
465927 on fridays countdown keith olbermann talked to newsweeks richard wolfe and former nixon white house counsel john dean about senators feinstein and schumers inexcusable caving on president bushs attorney general nominee and an abc news report that claims former acting assistant attorney general daniel levin was forced out of the doj when he declared waterboarding to be torture after allowing himself to be waterboarded
465928 i say water boarding is not a form of torture as described by national and international law and to prove it i am submitting myself to the process
465929 even if it were applied by foreign intelligence services on us citizens
465930 if he is still unsure whether the horrific practice of waterboarding is illegal then he shouldnt be confirmed
465931 the only reason to equivocate on waterboarding is to protect administration officials who authorized it from possible prosecution
465932 in addition to our dismay as citizens at these types of actions by our government we are concerned as psychologists that psychologist involvement in abusive interrogations is in violation of established national and international norms of medical and psychological ethics4
465933 the physician shall not use nor allow to be used as far as he or she can medical knowledge or skills or health information specific to individuals to facilitate or otherwise aid any interrogation legal or illegal
465934 bad boy bad boy what you gonna do what you gonna do when they come for you
465935 judge mukasey i think did the best he could to be responsible in not talking about interrogation techniques which as you all know we decline to do
465936 we dont torture that wasnt torture and we dont infringe on freedom of the press that was enforcement of fairness in reporting with emphasis honest
465937 let me know if you agree bush administration officials who claim the
465938 shaddup already the president says this doesnt hurt all that bad ya sissy now where are saddams nookular bombs
465939 that they would all be ashamed when the world eventually learned of it
465940 hey we cant afford to actually harm the slaves right
465941 because of things that happened earlier at guant namo there is a taint about it
465942 no matter how transparent no matter how open the trials if they took place in guant namo in the international community they would lack credibility
465943 to the prisoners suspicions that the real lawyers are not to be trusted and could be aiding the government
465944 i hear the train acoming its rolling round the bend
465945 one of five governing people in the mitchell jessen firm
465946 hey this is private enterprise at its best torture sells torture creates profitability and profitability is what makes this country move baby its certainly a great day in america when psychologists dont know the hippocratic oath from a hip replacement
465947 my hands and feet were frozen from the glacial cold
465948 but i did receive a letter from him which said he had no malicious intent he was only doing it to praise me and he had no idea about my anonymity
465949 i really find it hard to believe that the secretary of defence of the united states has no idea about the star witness for a criminal case being anonymous
465950 of course we dont torture anymore we outsource it just like we do everything else
465951 in a bizarre mixture of solicitude and sadism the memo details how to calibrate the infliction of harm it dictates that the insult slap will be initiated no more than 12 14 inches or one shoulder width from the detainees face to preclude any tendency to wind up or uppercut and interrogators are advised that when stripping off a prisoners clothes tearing motions shall be downward to prevent pulling the detainee off balance in short the sere inspired interrogations would be violent and therefore psychologists were needed to help make these more dangerous interrogations safer
465952 rumsfeld is very perceptive and has a mind like a steel trap theres no way hes suffering from crs cant remember shit hes trying to acquit himself
465953 from what i knew troops just dont take it upon themselves to initiate what they did without any form of knowledge of the higher ups
465954 somebody was giving them guidance but i was legally prevented from further investigation into higher authority
465955 hes trying to acquit himself and a lot of people who are lying to protect themselves
465956 secret detention facilities run by the cia did exist in europe from 2003 to 2005 in particular in poland and romania
465957 that doesnt mean they work in terms of extracting intelligence
465958 i didnt get actionable intelligence using the harsher methods i got it using manipulation and lying and by promising them things i didnt deliver on
465959 continued to act like a reporter detailing and documenting what he has seen and experienced inside guantanamo and then passing this on to his lawyers
465960 to issue an executive order that will set new ground rules for the cias secret program for interrogating captured al qaida types
465961 theres an assumption that often passes for common sense that the more pain imposed on someone the more likely they are to comply
465962 hey we dont torture we outsource so our hands are clean
465963 and this time i really really really really mean it
465964 if they can get good intelligence without using abusive techniques why do they so desperately need to use the abusive techniques
465965 no independent monitors have been able to see him since his arrest
465966 hey we cant slow down these kangaroo court proceedings for anything approximating due process
465967 has created even harsher and apparently more permanent conditions of extreme isolation and sensory deprivation in which detainees are confined to almost completely sealed individual cells with minimal contact with any other human being
465968 but faye turney thought she was gonna get raped doesnt that count for anything
465969 and if you ever mention torture in my courtroom again ill have your balls put back in the vice
465970 while the united states has an obligation to protect its citizens that does not relieve the united states from its responsibilities to comply with human rights
465971 hey weve outsourced just about everything else tortures no different
465972 you take a healthy guy and you turn him into a cripple at least for a period of time
465973 and we only had to waterboard him a little bit
465974 you really dont want to know about but they got really good results
465975 you really dont want to know about but they got really good results
465976 in his first weeks as defense secretary robert m gates repeatedly argued that the detention facility at guant namo bay had become so tainted abroad
465977 that legal proceedings at guant namo would be viewed as illegitimate
465978 really amounts to a mock execution which is illegal under international law
465979 it s an obligation for everyone to do what they can to uphold the constitution and prevent the government from breaking the law
465980 we got caught lying our asses off so in bush administration manner were going to blame the victim and dont forget to ignore the emails nailing fat karl for blowing off those prosecutors so we could transfer our corrupt image over to the democrats by pursuing false charges and make like you dont remember our continuing iran attack buildup otherwise israel wouldnt need all your taxpayer dollars to exist because really the cold war is over and we dont really need their nukes anymore and
465981 new rules issued by the pentagon today prohibit water boarding though there was no clear acknowledgement that it was permitted previously
465982 cia officers told abc news that 9 11 mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed lasted the longest under water boarding two and a half minutes before beginning to talk
465983 i was responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
465984 i am captain smith scott of the us marine force in baghdad iraq on the 10th day of february 2007 we captured three 3 of the terrorists in the process of torture they confessed being rebels for late ayman al zawahiri and took us to a cave in karbala here we recovered some us dollars amounting to 10 2m i am in keen need of a reliable and trustworthy person like you who would receive secure and protect these boxes containing the us dollars for me up on till my assignment elapses here in iraq
465985 mr padilla is suffering from mental defects stemming from his incarceration in the naval brig
465986 the effects of that incarceration have left mr padilla in such a psychologically frail posture that he cannot bear to revisit his past and hence cannot assist counsel in defending him against the governments allegations
465987 they said they didnt do it and by gum thats good enough for me
465988 i think at the end of the day hed made like 500 bucks before she hung herself
465989 we knew damn well if he went to canada he wouldnt be tortured
465990 ware appalled by the january 11 2007 statement of deputy assistant secretary of defense charles
465991 he who trades liberty for security deserves neither and will lose both
465992 it is remarkable that guantanamo still exists five years on
465993 but what is also remarkable is that guantanamo has distracted attention from other secret prisons the us has as of august last year we know there are 14 000 prisoners in us custody around the world
465994 we promise well use kinder gentler torture from here on out
465995 to argue that secretary of defense donald rumsfeld is directly responsible for the torture and abuse of detainees in u s military custody
465996 the hearing will be the first time a federal court will consider whether top u s officials can be held legally accountable for the torture scandal in iraq and afghanistan
465997 if these images are released to the public obviously its going to make matters worse
465998 cheney indicated that the bush administration doesnt regard water boarding as torture and allows the cia to use it
465999 cheneys comments in a white house interview on tuesday with a conservative radio talk show host appeared to reflect the bush administrations view that the president has the constitutional power to do whatever he deems necessary to fight terrorism
466000 this is outrageous for a sitting congressman who was shown pictures of abu ghraib that were not even available to the public because they were supposed to be more provocative
466001 the photographs did not only depict humiliating and degrading treatment of prisoners they showed prisoners who were killed
466002 examples of this abuse included hitting detainees denying them water and removal of privileges for no reason
466003 and its working just this morning alone 27 detainees admitted they were osama bin laden
466004 who cares we put enough voltage into his gonads hell confess to anything we want him to
466005 selected enlisted soldiers in the skills and knowledge required to perform tactical human intelligence collection
466006 the mps military police inflicted so much pain mr aamer said he thought he was going to die the mps pressed on pressure points all over his body his temples just under his jawline in the hollow beneath his ears they choked him they bent his nose so hard he thought it would break
466007 they pinched his thighs and feet constantly they gouged his eyes they held his eyes open and shined a maglite torch in them for minutes on end generating intense heat they bent his fingers until he screamed when he screamed they cut off his airway then put a mask on him so he could not cry out
466008 seeking this clarity is important to our efforts to continue gathering information about our enemies
466009 in all that we do in the war on terror we seek to promote the rule of law and protect freedom
466010 prohibits outrages upon personal dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment
466011 an international standard of very considerable importance and its content must be the same for all nations
466012 yeah well okay we have been holding and torturing these people without due process of law but look what we found we got the guys who sank the rms titanic killed jfk and we captured jack the ripper himself
466013 report on torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners at guant namo bay cuba
466014 consistent with our common values we will ensure that measures taken to combat terrorism comply fully with our international obligations including human rights law refugee law and international humanitarian law
466015 ordered all independent news media off the base by 10 a m wednesday and had arranged a flight to miami to expedite their departure
466016 it seems like the motive for force feeding detainees is to prevent embarrassment to the united states government because they dont appear to be waiting until someones life or health is in significant danger
466017 all those human rights thingies are just gettin in the way
466018 if these images are released to the public obviously its going to make matters worse
466019 absolutely committed to uphold its national and international obligations to eradicate torture
466020 absolutely committed to uphold its national and international obligations to eradicate torture
466021 and well break the legs of anyone who says we do
466022 it is the longest list of issues i have ever seen
466023 we are aware of no other nation in history that has afforded such protection for enemy combatants
466024 gonzales appears to be missing the point completely he completely fails to acknowledge the numerous allegations of ill treatment coming from guantanamo
466025 if the conditions of detention for detainees are as great as he claims then why not allow the u n and human rights organizations such as amnesty to visit guantanamo and speak directly to the detainees themselves
466026 your honors this man has confessed to the attacks of 9 11 the shoot downs of challenger colombia and twa 800 the assassinations of both kennedys martin luther king and abraham lincoln global warming and inflation
466027 what you and i mean by torture could be different
466028 the vast majority of bodies showed signs of summary execution many with their hands tied behind their back some showed evidence of torture with arms and leg joints broken by electric drills
466029 oh how could they have let such awful things go on why did they stand silently by how could they swallow all those monstrous lies i would never have stood for that kind of thing

466033 you should be aware that the home secretary has personally directed that he should be excluded from the uk on grounds of national security
466034 jamal kiyemba has lived his whole life in britain since he was a boy his mother and family all live here charles clarke refused to lift a finger to help him when he was being abused in guantanamo bay now he has barred him from his home and his mother based on allegations he wont reveal but which were almost certainly based on what jamal said under torture
466035 we pulled out teeth and fingers from prisoners but we got some good shit
466036 the line gets blurred between using liaison officers to bust heads and getting american guys to do it
466037 a society that is heading towards george orwells animal farm
466038 we know that al qaida terrorists are trained in trying to disseminate false allegations
466039 to refrain from any practice amounting to torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment

466041 oh yes oh yes youre gonna get it yes naughty little boys you little f ers you little f ers die ha ha
466042 well teach you to hide those weapons of mass destruction
466043 given dod s dedication and vigilant oversight it is not only unnecessary but irresponsible to demand reams of documents from the executive branch

466048 in sum the white houses policy which we can expect condi to elaborate
466049 we dont torture because we choose not to call it torture and we will fight all efforts to define torture according to its ordinary meaning
466050 with knives or scissors they took away my clothes in silence
466051 they tried to take off my pants i tried to stop them so they beat me again when i was naked i heard a camera
466052 look were sorry but all you ragheads names sound alike to us but just to show there are no hard feelings here are a dozen free eight by ten glossies for you
466053 theres no question in my mind where the philosophical guidance and the flexibility in order to do so originated in the vice president of the united states office
466054 his implementer in this case was defense secretary donald rumsfeld and the defense department
466055 we have become the criminals we have no further moral cause to fight for
466056 and well break the legs of anyone who says we do
466057 hey they were still alive when we left them nailed to the ceiling
466058 as long as no captives came up dead it happened we kept it to broken arms and legs
466059 engaged in interrogations using techniques they literally remembered from the movies
466060 sure we were all langers like when georgie asked us
466061 whats the point of this ive got nothing i can say to them ive told them everything i possibly could
466062 as far as i know its just to degrade you so when you leave here youll have these scars and youll never forget so youll always fear doing anything but what the us wants
466063 i mean i looked at them last night and theyre hard to believe
466064 that can only be described as blatantly sadistic cruel and inhumane
466065 to me its disgusting that this sort of treatment on these prisoners can fall inside some boundary that gives them the ok to do it
466066 hey lets skip camp x ray and cruise over to havana and catch a donkey show whatya say
466067 look maybe they werent terrorists when we locked them up but theyre sure gonna be terrorists if we let them go i mean look at how we treated them no wait dont look at how we treated them we treated them really really nice honest yeah but but they hate us and if we let them go yeah theyll do something really bad like talk to the press or some aw forget it i worked hard to be a dictator and its time i started acting like one im not letting them go and you cant make me
466068 and if we pass 100 000 volts through his gonads he sings like a canary it may be irrelevant rubbish but it sounds good
466069 evidence linking these israelis to 9 11 is classified i cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered its classified information
466070 and the way they are describing it is unfortunate and in some places i believe those people will regret having made those kind of comments
466071 stop saying we torture people or well break your arms
466072 some of the worst things that happened you dont know about okay videos um there are women there some of you may have read that they were passing letters out communications out to their men this is at abu ghraib the women were passing messages out saying please come and kill me because of whats happened and basically what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys children in cases that have been recorded the boys were sodomized with the cameras rolling and the worst above all of that is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking that your government has they are in total terror its going to come out
466073 we have very clear assurances from the us that they have substantial evidence they can rely on and they intend to proceed with the prosecution as soon as possible
466074 why did the administration repeatedly cite our findings about saddam hussein before the iraq war why does it welcome our criticisms of cuba china and north korea and why does it cite our research in its own annual human rights reports
466075 we do not torture people and ill roast the balls off of anyone who says we do
466076 four years after 9 11 the promise to make the world a safer place remains hollow
466077 we very humanely chained that tax driver to the ceiling until he humanely died
466078 ive seen similar injuries in an individual run over by a bus
466079 we are adopting a new policy towards our victims ummm i mean our prisoners
466080 we do not torture people and well burn the balls off of anyone who says we do dammit
466081 how dare the iraqis parade our soldiers in front of a camera
466082 our defense is that sending them where they can be tortured is the whole point
466083 evidence linking these israelis to 9 11 is classified i cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered its classified information
466084 we are pleased to announce that we have obtained confessions from all the detainees three have confessed to eating saddams weapons of mass destruction to conceal them eighteen have admitted shooting down challenger and colombia two hundred and forty seven admit to tearing the tags off of their seat cushions one has confessed to shooting abraham lincoln
466085 if we had only been told we couldnt act like sick amp twisted psychopaths
466086 had happened and are still happening in the global confidential detention network of the central intelligence agency cia
466087 witnessed two people get beaten so badly i believe it caused their deaths
466088 the issue is dying out the public has had its referendum
466089 im not saying that at all but i think there is a lot more of the story may have to come out yet
466090 but trust us this isnt official policy really honest no foolin
466091 this so called ill treatment and torture in detention centers stories of which were spread everywhere among the people and later by the prisoners who were freed were not as some assumed inflicted methodically but were excesses committed by individual prison guards their deputies and men who laid violent hands on the detainees
466092 in a war you have to let your men retaliate
466093 your job is to get prisoners and get information from them break them down quickly you have to move fast and hard we were certainly allowed to put sacks over prisoners heads in our day nothing wrong with that
466094 excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted
466095 we dont do those kinds of things and ill break the arm and rape the children of anyone who says we do
466096 the immediate impoundment of election machinery to prevent any further tampering
466097 i started getting people from a neighboring precinct coming to vote
466098 they said theyd been called over the weekend and told to come here
466099 thats the first indication we got that people had been deliberately misinformed
466100 we dont use torture and ill flog anyone who says we do
466101 using reasoning from the presidents memorandum of february 7 2002
466102 committed to helping ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year

466106 evidence linking these israelis to 9 11 is classified i cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered its classified information
466107 gee we would love to release those documents but you know they were destroyed in that last terrorist attack
466108 cause of the problems and what should be done to fix them
466109 watch america watch how we deal with this watch how america will do the right thing
466110 the boys were sodomised with the cameras rolling and the worst part is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking and this is your government at war
466111 self appointed counterterrorism mission advertisement that included abusing eight inmates in a private jail by hanging them by their feet
466112 they were behaving like they were watching a comedy on stage
466113 gee we were all ready for the inspection but the umm terrorists yeah thats it terrorists burned the place down last night
466114 contrary to the official position of the united states the united nations and all other states that have considered the issue
466115 not after we got done with them at any rate
466116 all told more than 3 000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries and many others have met a different fate
466117 they are no longer a problem for the united states and our friends and allies
466118 protected by the doctrine of separation of powers in the constitution
466119 hersh said he had seen all the abu ghraib pictures he said you havent begun to see evil then trailed off he said horrible things done to children of women prisoners as the cameras run he looked frightened
466120 okay so were not the good guys deal with it
466121 the authorization i issued was that anything we did would conform to u s law and would be consistent with international treaty obligations thats the message i gave our people
466122 the president despite domestic and international laws constraining the use of torture has the authority as commander in chief to approve almost any physical or psychological actions during interrogation up to and including torture
466123 reports of police brutality maltreatment and torture in police jails and prisons are common and seem to be well founded in many cases
466124 because they started to hit my broken leg i curse my religion
466125 no basis in any sanctioned program training manual instruction or order in the department of defense
466126 israeli link possible in us torture techniques in exchange for interrogation training did washington award security contracts
466127 i was told the purpose was to create an army of informants people you could insert back into the population
466128 we know that the israeli intelligence was operating in baghdad after the war was over the question should be were there any foreign interrogators among those that were recommending very very bad treatment for the prisoners
466129 the way we treated these men was hard even for the soldiers especially after realising that many of these combatants were no more than shepherds
466130 what youre seeing in the photographs now really is tame
466131 even transferring patients in the city was impossible you can see our ambulances outside they also shot into the main doors with snipers of one of our centers
466132 the whole thing is disgusting and its hard to believe that this actually is taking place in a military facility
466133 objects indispensable to the survival of another countrys civilian population
466134 after all why upset their simple little minds with this sort of thing
466135 i just got your fax and you dont know what youre talking about
466136 i doubt if you could spell half the words in the letter and somebody wrote it for you
466137 so i dont pay much attention to it but ill call you back later and let you tell me more about why you think youre such a great goddamn hero

466140 by the time he got out the whole area was inflamed with violence
466141 asked to interview the parents regarding mr bergs purpose in iraq
466142 i basically ended up doing most of the investigating myself
466143 if these images are released to the public obviously its going to make matters worse
466144 we watch as two of the leading democracies two leading nations of the free world get involved in a war that the united nations did not sanction
466145 we look on with horror as reports surface of terrible abuses against the dignity of human beings held captive by invading forces in their own country
466146 he shared his frustration in his march 23 e mail message to mr
466147 there was a before 9 11 and there was an after 9 11 after 9 11 the gloves come off
466148 the elements we found were tantamount to torture there were clearly incidents of degrading and inhuman treatment
466149 there are elements which refer to actions that were contrary to international humanitarian law very clearly in that report
466150 don rumsfeld is the best secretary of defense the united states has ever had
466151 they are trying to pin all of this on the lower ranks my daughter was just following orders i think theres a conspiracy
466152 the american public needs to understand were talking about rape and murder here
466153 there are a lot more photographs and videos that exist if these are released to the public obviously its going to make matters worse
466154 maybe the people who executed this pulled off a brilliant maneuver
466155 if there has been humiliation it isnt the fault of the west it is muslims fault
466156 she was naked and screaming and calling out to him as they beat her her brother was helpless and could only hear her cries this affected all of us because she was just a child
466157 it is not secret at all there are many israeli experts on torture in iraq who are transferring to the americans their accumulative experience of thirty seven years of torturing and mistreating palestinians
466158 the bush administrations policy in iraq is now a cocktail of contradictory images and messages groping for an exit strategy
466159 evidence linking these israelis to 9 11 is classified i cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered its classified information
466160 the mother was always working and he essentially raised the child but the father was a control freak
466161 ultimately he refused to say who he really was so she got custody
466162 that never happened im flabbergasted by this whole thing this is the ultimate betrayal
466163 uno de los principios en restauraci n es que debe distinguirse el a adido del original pero a la hora de hacerlo es muy importante que el nuevo elemento no perturbe la imagen del edificio ni llame la atenci n m s bien debe ser un detalle de la fachada una especie de gui o secreto que hace el restaurador

466165 what i learned early in my career in the nfl is if you worry about things that happen mistakes then before you know it its affecting you in the next play

466170 anytime you get a second opportunity in this league you have to really embrace it
466171 jerry jones and the dallas cowboy family took me in and they gave me an opportunity to recreate myself as a good player and reinvent my name in a positive way
466172 that was the toughest team and the best team in the league that we played
466173 after that game we did feel like we could win it all that was the real challenge for us playing against the cowboys and i let jerry know that
466174 our playbook in college was pretty extensive it just prepared me better to understand how the game works your keys to run the football and picking up linebackers

466200 i think one of the issues that we are struggling with and im sure well overcome it is ensuring that we can attract and excite enough canadian public servants to come over here
466201 you want to make sure that they start to take language training that they can speak pashto when they come out and that takes time
466202 you want to make sure that theyre getting a good enough basis on the afghan file before they come out you want to make sure they get their hostile environment training theres all of these things that weve been learning over the course of the last two years that were now trying to put into practice and we want to do that on a sustained basis so thats the challenge

466322 yeah you get out here we did a big training ride last sunday at terrys house a nice long ride as kind of the last preparation for saturday we had a good group that turned out for that so were ready to go for the next two days have a little fun and raise a lot of money this is my third year its a great event the teams get bigger every year which is a good sign that were creating a lot of awareness and raising a lot of money its great we ride in different packs we have some riders who are far superior than a lot of guys like myself don sweeney a really avid rider he goes out hard and he can ride with the best of them we have a lot of guys who are kind of middle of the pack that ride in small little groups and i think thats the best way to go at your own pace for most of us its a ride its not a race and we have a lot of fun doing it
466323 i dont know about that im still fairly new and you if go out with all the experienced guys that experience will humble you in a heartbeat youll always find somebody thats in better shape than you are so its a good challenge i ride with a good group of guys in lynnfield and we have a blast and just go out to enjoy the whole experience of pmc this is my third year youre dead on that its a tremendous cause ive been hearing stories every year that inspire you left and right i went over to visit dana farber the other day and these kids the strength that they have youve got to find a cure we want to contribute some little iota and hopefully by being a part of this we help a little bit
466324 im excited im hoping for good weather thats all if its rainy it makes it very difficult because were going to ride anyway ive been training enough to survive the ride but its not a race for me to be able to finish the 290 miles and raise the money thats the objective really its a great cause and youll find as you get older everybodys touched by cancer a family member a friend it just touches so many lives and its a cause that everybody can come together with and hopefully do something about
466325 im excited but i dont know if im ready to go laughing i dont train a lot for it and i ride a recumbent and its not a really cardiovascular thing i figure its going to hurt a lot anyways so why hurt more i rode 70 miles last weekend and i found out that my seats too far away from my pedals because my knees were killing me so i have to move my seat up thats the best thing to come out of that ride i think by saturday i should be ready to go at least i hope so its fun this is totally different ive never been a bike rider per se never joined a bike club as a kid so its been a long time when i did this last year for the first time it was a real challenge anytime you do something for the first time its a challenge thats why they call it a challenge i made it and i was pretty proud of myself that i made it but im really not looking forward to doing it again but i am doing it again this year i dont know of anybody especially the older you get that doesnt know somebody thats affected by cancer you hear it on the newspapers and tv all the time its a real epidemic and we need all the money that we can get and give it to these people to find out how to stop it there are just so many different types of it there are so many therapies theyve come a long way the lifespan has increased in a lot of different ways with different cancers and thats directly due to fundraising money going in and them having the money to use to find cures so i am happy to be able to just be a little part of it
466326 ive been training a bit not really hard not like don sweens sweeney probably but i got enough rides in and hopefully itll be fine this is my 3rd year doing it with the bruins team its a great cause a great event and every year you look forward to it you dread the training rides but you look forward to this event its a lot of fun and we have a great group of people doing it for the bruins cause and its been a lot of fun its a lot of fun especially because its guys from all different eras and it seems like every year we add one more guy that played tim sweeneys coming along this year and i dont want to put any pressure on steve leach but i hear hes coming the year after next year but its a lot of fun having guys join up
466327 at the end of the day i guess the quality of a womans sex life is determined by how deeply she allows herself to feel pleasure
466328 i think that many people women and men are afraid of feeling too good about anything a lot of women probably dont have the time and or mental emotional space to really get to know themselves sexually
466329 so much of what is publicized as hot female sexuality is about being sexually appealing to someone else that doesnt encourage women to develop a deep understanding of what turns us on it takes some self exploration to find out what really feels good to you beyond a simple climax for numerous reasons not every woman feels entitled to pleasure or inspired to undertake that kind of exploration
466330 i call that photo my brand with a wink even though i mean it
466331 we are a little perplexed at this point to tell you the truth

466366 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
466367 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
466368 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
466369 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy

466386 would you support instant runoff voting or similar voting reforms for city elections why or why not
466387 voting process that is in place has worked to a point thus far
466388 would be wary of changing the voting method that has traditionally been used in all massachusetts cities
466389 any such change would require great support among the electorate
466390 no i believe the present system works well and it gives the voting public the opportunity to change their vote if they wish as they learn more about the candidates

466445 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

466458 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
466459 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
466460 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
466461 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
466462 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
466463 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
466464 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
466465 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
466466 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
466467 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
466468 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
466469 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
466470 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
466471 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
466472 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
466473 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

466486 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
466487 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
466488 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
466489 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
466490 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
466491 i did that one spring when i was exuberant about the first warm
466492 i think you were trying to get in touch with your
466493 my prayers are with you your mother and your family let us know more
466494 plans for your welfare and not to harm to give you a future with hope
466495 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
466496 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
466497 perumpamaan orang orang mumin dalam hal kecintaan kasih sayang dan belas kasihan sesama mereka laksana satu tubuh jika satu anggota tubuh tersebut sakit maka akan menjalarkan kesakitan itu pada semua anggota tubuh yang lain dengan menimbulkan tidak bisa tidur dan demam
466498 akan datang di satu masa dimana kalian dikerumuni dari berbagai arah bagaikan segerombolan orang orang rakus yang berkerumun berebut di sekitar hidangan
466499 apakah karena di waktu itu kita berjumlah sedikit ya rasulallah
466500 bukan bahkan jumlah kalian pada waktu itu banyak akan tetapi kalian laksana buih yang terapung apung pada waktu itu rasa takut di hati lawanmu telah dicabut oleh allah dan dalam jiwamu tertanam penyakit al wahnu
466501 cinta yang berlebih lebihan terhadap dunia dan takut yang berlebih lebihan terhadap mati
466502 apa saja yang dibawa diperintahkan oleh rasul berupa hukum kepadamu maka terimalah dia dan apa saja yang dilarangnya bagimu maka tinggalkanlah
466503 sesungguhnya telah datang kepada kamu keterangan yang nyata dari tuhan mu sebagai petunjuk dan rahmat
466504 dan siapakah yang lebih baik perkataannya daripada orang yang menyeru kepada allah mengerjakan amal shaleh dan berkata sesungguhnya aku ini termasuk orang orang muslim
466505 hey dad what about you do you have a bucket list
466506 what do you want to be when you grow up
466507 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
466508 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
466509 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
466510 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
466511 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
466512 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
466513 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
466514 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
466515 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
466516 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

466526 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
466527 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
466528 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
466529 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
466530 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
466531 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy

466538 let us not become weary in doing good for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up
466539 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
466540 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
466541 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
466542 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
466543 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
466544 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
466545 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
466546 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
466547 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
466548 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill

466642 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
466643 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
466644 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
466645 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well

466700 i have culled every detail which seemed to illustrate what the emigrants experienced on the way like the frustrating delays at departure freezing in the snow as they left ireland roasting in the tropics prostrated by seasickness tossed by heavy seas living on a monotonous and inadequate diet of bread biscuits tea sugar rice salt meat and salt pork of doubtful condition and watching their children die yet being unable to do a thing to help them

466754 this city is sucking the life out of you and you have a child to think of
466755 to depict what is indescribable what cant be put into words
466756 if a writer like him who was so talented couldnt do it
466757 sometimes a person has to tackle the one thing that he can talk about with any sort of authority
466758 but you do have some grasp of the whole concept right
466759 im not good enough yet to do that its just a few small things

466764 you dont have even a minute to go when do i get my play
466765 its already sold out a hit show seizure of a dolls house people will be laughing their heads off its a great title
466766 theres so much fucking anxiety everywhere thats all anyone writes about
466767 they make it so damned easy for themselves it doesnt take much art to make people feel bad does it
466768 do you want to do something hard something that nobody else can do

466773 thats not just some broad that you go out with thats a lady that you climb aboard she could take you anywhere
466774 it sounded as if you were thinking of changing professions

466780 he was a great rascal may he rest in peace
466781 as soon as i wake up i lose them its impossible for me to describe them but the sensation they convey remains indelible cruelty doctor a primordial irrational unrepentant cruelty
466782 it renews itself without stopping without interruption its as if its poison that poison is always flowing from an enormous fountain
466783 feeling angry isnt common in a society in which the balance between respect for others and freedom is destroyed and is incessantly reconstructed in the soul of each individual the society doesnt have anything to regulate in this regard it is in the bosom of the society through the free interaction of individuals where that balance is fully realized
466784 reunifying both stages through the use of a similar or equivalent examination of what can clearly be understood only in one of the stages during the transition phase can be fatal it would mean interchanging the horror only recognized in the dream with the terrain of complete lucidity and doing that could simply cause the illness to become irreversible
466785 all right you win starting with the next session were going to concentrate on expedition 3 yes it could be but i still have my doubts
466786 a hormone found in carbon atoms that excessively heightens fear especially if the serotonin an anti depression and counter aggressive agent decreases to unacceptable concentrations
466787 i see that all of that combines with accelerated levels of cortisol one of the adrenal hormones
466788 beings with cruel faces i see beings with cruel faces
466789 i suppose you want me to go over all the details again
466790 as you can see the quickest way for me to get home was to take the old road over the mountains
466791 i set off around ten oclock theres only one tunnel on that road and it took me a little over an hour to get to it the incident that is when i picked up that person happened just before it right here
466792 you said person but i heard it was a woman
466793 young people these days all have long hair and wear the same clothes so you cant always tell anymore
466794 she was standing by a gap in the guardrail about here theres a bus stop there by the way
466795 so its not altogether strange for someone to be standing there is it
466796 thats what i thought too but then it occurred to me that there were no buses at that time of night it was already past eleven
466797 there arent any that you can see from the road although there is a wasabi plantation with a farmhouse not too far away but the bus stops mainly used by hikers
466798 so you didnt feel even remotely suspicious seeing someone there at that time of night
466799 im not much good at talking and there are some things i cant explain well you can read about them in here
466800 in psychiatry we consider cases like these to be hallucinations the person concerned will insist that he was compos mentis but his self diagnosis is unreliable if we accept the premise that ghosts are unscientific and as such do not exist no other explanation is possible
466801 may i ask who you are and what business you have with the professor
466802 im sorry i was so short with you earlier i was wondering if you had read that article yet
466803 quite that scholar was too clever for me or rather i should say he was too good at arguing his case i didnt stand a chance but im sure you understood the issue better by reading that article than by talking to me
466804 i assumed thats what a writer would do did you speak to him
466805 are you free tonight how about i show you that mountain road
466806 sure youve come all the way from tokyo so im sure you want more than just to hear the story dont you
466807 why not it wont take up much of your time we can take the new highway to get there
466808 no i dont reckon id like that mountain road at night im a driver too you know
466809 indeed i am im just the coward to see a ghost ill be glad to accompany you in the daytime though
466810 youre certainly frank arent you well then tomorrows saturday and the banks closed so ill come and pick you up just before noon
466811 oh is that in your way please pass it over here
466812 what a great pace of life youve got here wed never be able to go on such a peaceful drive in tokyo
466813 but thats the problem the population heres declining and employment opportunities along with it
466814 but youre one of the elite arent you coming from a big bank like yours
466815 you must be joking theres an elite group within the bank but its at saturation point for those of us who only graduated from vocational school this car is nice enough but it belongs to my parents most days i get around by motorbike on the bill collection rounds
466816 professor kidokoro and yourself an author are in altogether a different league from me
466817 in fact i came back here one night after that magazine debate
466818 i suppose he agreed he would have wanted to test his theory
466819 thats right hes still young not like you i had my work cut out to convince him but in the end i had the last laugh
466820 i had professor kidokoro sit in the front and i was driving at pretty much the speed im driving at now of course it was pitch black outside not like now the conditions were worse than before too with a light rain falling
466821 just right for a ghost to appear then in the old stories it was usually raining
466822 this was where it happened you see over there where the road widens
466823 she was there all right and she was there again when i came with professor kidokoro
466824 over there by the shelter she was standing in front of it getting wet there she is i yelled but the professor commanded me to drive on without stopping i myself was scared half out of my wits so i changed down a gear and stepped on the gas like this
466825 it was just about here i checked the rearview mirror and saw her sitting there on the back seat right where youre sitting now
466826 thats right just behind professor kidokoro i nudged him with my elbow to warn him and he spun round and screamed and then still gripping the seat with his body twisted around he went stiff and passed out
466827 i panicked and drove as fast as i could just like now
466828 no after the professor screamed i no longer saw her in the rearview mirror but it was difficult to drive with the professor frozen there clinging to the seat
466829 which means that unlike the previous time she disappeared almost immediately
466830 thats right this time there were two men and when the professor cried out i guess she must have been shocked and went away
466831 i stopped the car somewhere around here and tried shaking him he was alive but was stiff as a board and his fingers were still digging into the seat look here where its all flabby he must have torn the stuffing inside
466832 the professor was in quite a state so i went straight home and called the university hospital and the police it took all of us to remove him from the seat and finally get him out of the car they were dumbfounded when i told them what had happened the hospital representative in particular looked appalled that such an upstanding scientist would even have ventured such an experiment
466833 well its a bit hard for me to say this but hes been weak kneed as we say in these parts ever since im sorry to say so but he hasnt yet recovered his sanity
466834 it really is awful im afraid its not so much a case of professor kidokoro not being at the hospital but rather of the hospital trying to cover it up hes probably receiving treatment i do hope he recovers soon
466835 really that is a shame well if youre leaving ill give you a ride to the station we can drop by your hostel to pick up your suitcase if we go now youll make the four thirty express
466836 the long awaited thursday arrived without any enthusiasm i was preparing a plate of biryani to celebrate the occasion then they told me i was a child not to fix rich food for nahla because she would die if i fed her meat or fish she had to hear the news on an empty stomach so they said how could i understand how could i digest an album chock full of wise saying and beliefs i was bewildered what could i give her to eat what would nahla think when her plate lacked a piece of meat or fish especially on a joyful occasion like this how could we hide the gown from her where do you suppose she would spend the night i watched her hoping i wouldnt be chosen to break the news to her scarves covered her head but some yellow strands of hair had escaped from their ribbons some curly and some straight according to the amount of moisture they had retained and the hair spray which dulled the brilliance of her hair nahlas golden hair and fair complexion have been her passport wherever she settles i trembled when i placed a glass of water on the ground before her when we were young we trembled the same way whenever we carried water to my father for fear he would be angry if the water spilled her legs which were stretched out on the ground reminded me of those of my older half sister narjis i observed her thoughtfully again for a time she was oblivious to everything around her various feelings competed for control of me since i didnt know which was appropriate all of nahlas comical gestures made us laugh creating a commotion among the girls in the class indeed virtually all the girls of basras preparatory school recognized that about her she would sit on the ground like an ignorant ill educated old woman like narjis for a long time she would imitate how narjis sighed exhaled and sang she also was an excellent performer of the gypsy girls dances at the midday programs on fridays especially the finale of their programs except for the two of us the courtyard was empty everyone else had disappeared on account of the news the sun had begun to shift its light to the other side no one was peeking out or standing nearby
466837 no im laughing because im distressed by the situation from remembering narjis who is my half sister she was almost the same age as my mother but always denied that fact as long as she lived she called my mother al hajjiya or fathers wife to make it clear that she was younger than my mother
466838 she would sit in the courtyard before noon sewing buttons on a new blouse while singing o emissary of love which the egyptian vocalist najat al saghirah made famous narjis vibrato southern rendition lent the song a regional southern flavor that expressed her deprivations with the outpouring of her mysterious passion for an unknown person her southern accent displaced rosy dreamy najat from her own songs i remember how she eyed me her look unexpectedly transferred to me everything she had suffered throughout her life
466839 has the child in me ever grown up i feel that the child marwa still lives inside me how old do you think i am now
466840 but ill tell you as simply as i can that the child in me has ever since i was a girl sympathized with her and felt sorry for her no matter how impatient i was with her and despite the hidden currents of my environment and the declared and undeclared wars around me when youre young lifes nothing but a bunch of contradictions
466841 ill tell you about nahla my friend nahla the child of that environment the mother of ease the chatterbox kubbat al hamudh and authority on hudhayris songs and the neighbors quarrels known for the contemporary camouflage of her vocabulary and attire enviable skin bright eyes free flowing blonde hair and french perfume
466842 all the same narjis didnt think of running away to free herself from the life imposed on her or of rebelling and abdicating her responsibilities in favor of whatever her body would have chosen for her instead
466843 colors of the fourth night its a sketch for a monument that may someday find a small space over there to occupy one of the thousands of spots where statues of the leader stand
466844 fish are portrayed vertically in a pool of water they twist like a tree their heads down the fishes faces grin widely the tanks water covers half of their bodies their tails are raised entwined theyll be different bright colors they symbolize the peaceful coexistence that has vanished from human communities in that region of the earth
466845 i was alone waiting for someone to rescue me or to help me calm her agitation that day i placed the silver nail polish in front of her and then examined my nails shes delighted with my insistence on taking a nail file and polish with me wherever i settle but nahla cant stand the rasping sound of the file on fingernails
466846 the house is where my father mother brother and my brothers wife reside i think i should change my everyday dishdasha to a better one and fix my braids which are pulled back before anyone else arrives i have severe abdominal cramps and consequently stay in the bathroom for a long time even so i offer her a plate of the biryani ive made to celebrate the occasion thats a duty she wont die i cant help thinking shell need the foods energy to endure the news despite all the advice they gave me i wouldnt have been able to prepare anything else then since waiting for the women paralyzed me you may not be able to imagine this but biryanis blend of spices in which the smell of curry predominates penetrates beneath the fingernails and leaves a yellow stain that wont wash off that smell makes it hard for me to breathe whenever i inhale it
466847 there wasnt enough time for me to feel awkward or to retreat into myself with eyes downcast i was stammering embarrassed that i might mess up the compliments repeated on such occasions i didnt know what to say because im not good with such matters i was cursing my involvement with them i sensed her hunger too nahla more than any of the other girls cant wait whether in front of the schools cafeteria or when she visits someone thats how she is of the whole group shes the one most driven by personal wants shes the one who insists on responding to her needs she imposes her wishes on us and we accept shes the one who frees herself from the groups obligations so she comes and goes when she wishes she makes me feel im falling behind while she surges forward
466848 when i asked nahla about rida she told me this time is different marwa she repeated this time is different she told me he wanted her passionately that was a surprise to me i expressed my anxiety in phrases like be careful this time or thats the way it seems to me with reference to a stage in a persons life the early twenties we werent stingy when it came to giving each other loads of advice assuming the role of those who had gone before us except that i privately speculated on the basis of the limited world known to me that desires occasionally may be all we need to make important decisions and defend them all the same the extent of my na vet did not change a thing in this situation so i assumed that either love or material possessions could have been responsible for the agreement i dont know whether her desires alone made her pursue a multifaceted affair and plunge into the hazardous adventure another time she told me that im slow indeed in continual retreat so that whatever i have is stolen from me and thats how its been since i was a child despite all the blaze of emotions and tears i assumed that the decision might have been made according to the last petal of a daisy its these simple disparities that suddenly place us at a turning point are adolescent love and mature love actually two different entities or was the woman smitten by both piecing these bits of information together still eludes me for this reason my bewilderment persists like a chronic malady i might just as well not have been raised and grown up in the same place
466849 she asks me to attend to all the details of her wedding thus i gain the right to entertain her and her nuptials which we all participate in adorn my room i spray the tulle generously with starch and water i spread the gown on my bed i pleat its train with my fingers and fearfully plant the needle in the fabric i gather the pearls arrange the large beads and the tiny ones and collect the hairpins i fetch the hair dryer and look for the extension i have the honor of styling her hair plucking her eyebrows setting out her shoes her satin purse and i hear her grumble oh marwa where by god have you put the quran and the mirror oh thursday the promise of nuptial thursday appointed occasion for love this is thursday which is reserved for vows and resolving problems ridas thursday i fuss with the air conditioning starting it that morning hoping the room will be cool enough for her the air conditioner increases the humidity ruining her hair and creating havoc with her things that noon even the water added to my perplexity when it stopped flowing through the plates of compressed hay and the massive body of the air cooler let me down spraying out annoying stinging air from its rusty depths in puffs
466850 i had to do something but knew nothing about herbal teas roasted seeds or dried apricots i thought of fixing her a salty iced yogurt drink to help her mask her shock when i was a child i was told erroneously one day on my way home from school that our house was on fire narjis sat me down on the bench in the kitchen and washed my face with cold water your face has been spirited away she said then she quickly fixed tea for me to drink i complained it tastes strange she replied thats because of your fright was it her embrace or the strange tasting tea that dissolved the terror in my heart a perennially terrified child lurks inside me i felt angry perspired freely and beat my head against the wall when nahla wasnt looking
466851 why was i given this responsibility my premonitions frightened me i imagined that nahla would tug on her hair and tear her gown then i thought no no im merely reacting to my own intense alarm and that of the people around me thats making me think things will end badly do you know everyone there is terrified when a womans scream suddenly rips through an area emerging from a distant location as if to warn them they will certainly lose a loved one or relative consider narjis apprehension about her fathers death or my mothers wail when she saw the body bag containing my brother i wonder how the child in me derives guidance for a reassuring explanation of the calamitous images that have been imprinted in my memory since childhood suddenly the telephone rang i hurried to lift the receiver before it could spread alarm why didnt i shield myself by appealing to my heritage where would the words come from what should i say what expressions should i choose instead of a bridal procession i pray that a delegation of women will arrive and rescue me but then i will be obliged to kiss them one after the other twice on each cheek and we might cross to the left and right sides with three or four kisses this black cloud approaches me there will be the familiar words to which i must respond with even more gracious phrases moist importunate kisses that would be delivered full force not to mention the suns blaze our profuse perspiration and their panting breath against my cheek meanwhile she sits feeling annoyed by the dryness of her tender thighs and legs choosing an approach that isnt like her she is evasive not wanting to know borrowing the moisturizing cream from me again that morning she had received a special therapeutic cream that my brothers wife advised her to use her first night nahla and i believe this wont be her first night at that time when she suddenly glances at me i look away for fear i will divulge her secrets she anoints her skin repeatedly haughtily displaying her riches without meaning to her long neck her small milk white breasts and the edges of her large dark circular nipples emerge casually from the wide opening of her tunic which she selected for the ease with which it can be removed without damaging her hairdo or makeup i observe her and hide my trepidation she has forgotten shes hungry she doesnt attempt to ask me about anything at all why is she with me because im her friend because im brown and shes fair im thin and shes plump because i need her who has helped prepare her party i may have been bewitched by her as narjis says in spite of myself im tempted by the thought of running away
466852 what shall i do with that nagging homeland my country my birthplace the land of my grandfathers my roots do you realize it needs someone to classify it i want to describe draw reshape and carve it so i can escape from its bitterness from my hatred and scorn for it and for myself
466853 dont ask me those alleys where houses protrude giving people names and prescribing their daily routines seem suddenly blocked and destruction looms sunset casts its melancholy across the rooms contents the electricity goes off raiding airplanes search for light were not a target no one is looking down on us the women dont come we continue to nestle against each other nahla who is halfway through adorning herself is struck dumb she collapses against my shoulder submissively her cheek and strands of her hair press into the flesh of my neck the lanterns heat increases and reveals how very close we are to each other i wish one of the women would take my place and stroke her hair or allow her to cry i doubt that the quality of my sorrow is adequate thats always the way it is with me so i remain silent they tell me that sunni women dont slap themselves in despair the way shii women do and that they retain their elegance while they grieve like the christians they style their hair when they attend funerals they whisper together while their faces remain expressionless and then sip coffee silently so how do jews mourn suddenly the apparition of a swarm of women replaces me as they begin tearing their free flowing garments the light that issues from the lantern appears and disappears at the center of the dance floor to which they descend in the courtyard as if they have retained a perennial passion for performing the moment that death calls someone sympathy inundates them and they quickly gather to play their role again with deftness and skill there are two circles one advancing and one retreating hair is allowed to flow freely and shaken till disheveled abayas fall to the ground and head coverings are trodden under foot bra straps slip and black stockings slide down as women pound the earth to the beat of the elegy like a set of russian dolls the pain revealed consists of a series of pains nested inside each other the beat is rapid and the dance comes in repeated rushes until the women are overcome by the most extreme forms of intoxicating grief

466858 and when i am president i will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
466859 thats how we can protect our coasts and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
466860 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
466861 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

466866 the democratic congress should be held in contempt for voting to skip town without dealing with americas energy crisis
466867 democrats are out of touch out of excuses out of support and out of time americans are hurting independent polls show they overwhelmingly support house republicans all of the above energy solutions
466868 its time democrats put their boarding passes back in their pockets and get to work by voting on the american energy act
466869 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
466870 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates but that i think that what people are really concerned about what theyre looking for is fundamental change on the economy things that are going to help their families live out the american dream there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phoney allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families

466893 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
466894 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed

466914 our grandfather thought frank was a point of connection a bridge if you will to the larger african american experience for my brother
466915 frank was part of a group of black vanguard intellectuals
466916 the people that he came into contact with throughout his life like richard wright and margaret walker were very significant
466917 you could get a lot of strength from a person like frank who had suffered all the discrimination that a black man goes through in america

466929 theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
466930 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development

466957 its certainly a black eye for the industry but unfortunately altercations on the field are part of the game
466958 it certainly wont deter me from continuing to go to minor league baseball games
466959 i think its just good baseball at its purest form
466960 i dont think the sport of baseball can mandate cultural behavior but i think baseball does a wonderful job of setting a good example by and large day in and day out
466961 minor league baseball is sort of a beacon of family entertainment
466962 i think its important to be very punitive in terms of disciplinary measures if anything happens that takes away from that aspect of minor league baseball
466963 but its so rare and few and far between that i dont think it would be a concern in the long term
466964 after the 11th i was hoping to get to 5 or 6 under and still have a chance
466965 today was a little better more regular golf i missed a few shots here and there but i kept going and when you hole a shot like that on the 11th it keeps the momentum going
466966 what was really special was coming down the last eight with that great support teeing up so early compared with leaders we still had a huge crowd and it was very special coming up 18 i hope it will be like that tomorrow
466967 im not going to play next year but i have been asked about being a captain and i said id be honored if asked
466968 im extremely lucky i think as early in my career id be working with the yash raj banner they yash raj banner people treat you like a family its been a wonderful experience and im really looking forward to doing more films with them
466969 its excellent ive known siddharth from a very young age we have grown up together and we are great family friends so the experience has been really beautiful its been a beautiful journey for me as well as the character raj and we worked really hard on the film i really hope that audiences likes it too

466972 there is salvation in no one else but jesus for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which they can be saved
466973 in the western world which is increasingly becoming distanced from its christian traditions and roots a context of moral confusion has ensued and sound christian ethical and moral principles and values are under threat from various quarters
466974 blending faith and culture harmoniously together through art music dance and liturgy making something beautiful before god and men
466975 those values in non christian traditions which are compatible with christian thought and behavior and use them as starting points for a fruitful inter religious dialogue
466976 are of one mind and heart notwithstanding their diversity their missionary thrust is indeed enhanced and strengthened but when the diversity degenerates into division it becomes a counter witness which seriously compromises their image and endeavors to spread the good news of jesus christ
466977 whether their pastoral endeavors are inspired by god or motivated by human criteria or prompted by the evil one
466978 it became increasingly clear that the ordination of women priests and bishops in a growing number of provinces has presented what is for the catholic church a major stumbling block to the hoped for reconciliation of ministries
466979 what was emerging through them was a deepening doctrine of the church as koinonia
466980 pope benedict again and again comes back to this as at the heart of what he is working for
466981 kasper highlighted the growing distance between the catholic church and the anglican communion especially since some of the anglican provinces began ordaining women to the priesthood in 1974 and to the episcopate beginning in 1989
466982 that we will not be drawn apart and that we will be able to remain in serious dialogue in search of full unity so that the world may believe
466983 love for christ which invites us into practical co operation and service
466984 the central argument about the nature of the episcopal office as an office of unity is relevant to all of the points of tension in the anglican communion
466985 i argued that unity unanimity and koinonia communion are fundamental concepts in the new testament and in the early church
466986 we have been able to set forward a strong vision of episcopal ministry within the context of a shared understanding of the church as koinonia
466987 it has been particularly disheartening to have witnessed the increasing tensions within the anglican communion
466988 a clear statement from the anglican communion would greatly strengthen the possibility of us giving common witness regarding human sexuality and marriage a witness which is sorely needed in the world of today
466989 not only a disciplinary position but an expression of our faithfulness to jesus christ
466990 while our dialogue has led to significant agreement on the understanding of ministry the ordination of women to the episcopate effectively and definitively blocks a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church
466991 it now seems that full visible communion as the aim of our dialogue has receded further and that our dialogue will have less ultimate goals and therefore will be altered in its character while such a dialogue could still lead to good results it would not be sustained by the dynamism which arises from the realistic possibility of the unity christ asks of us or the shared partaking of the one lords table for which we so earnestly long

466999 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

467035 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history

467046 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
467047 our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
467048 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
467049 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
467050 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
467051 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
467052 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
467053 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
467054 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
467055 a grain of rice tied to a piece of spaghetti
467056 if liverpool at the end of it do not come up with the money thats fault but their own
467057 id be delighted if that was the case and gareth stayed but i doubt it very much the ball is very much in their court
467058 there will be no deadline and liverpool will have all the time in the world to sign him theyve got to the end of the transfer window at the end of the month
467059 ive got a football club to run and i really do want people who want to play for me
467060 we had a meeting last monday with gareth and his agent at which we all agreed we would have a 5pm deadline on wednesday and if liverpool had not proved they had the wherewithal to proceed with the transfer deal then we would all leave that aside and go on with it oneill said
467061 i was hoping that would be the case and this was not a matter of liverpool missing the deadline by 15 minutes as seems to have been reported
467062 so ive listened to what theyve said and ill go with it reluctantly but ill go with it there will be no deadline and liverpool have all the time in the world now to sign gareth barry theyve got up to the normal window which is the 31st of this month so its really up to them gareth and his agent to sort it out ive decided this is the only way forward for us really i have a football club to run and i want people who want to play for us if liverpool at the end of it all do not come up with the money thats no one elses fault but their own id be delighted if that was the case and gareth stayed but i would doubt that very much the ball is very much in their court

467073 the duty of state government is to serve and protect people our first job is making sure we are serving the public and are available to the public
467074 the state director of personnel is currently reviewing telecommuting policies with that goal in mind and we would consider any proposals for a four day week in the same vein
467075 but supervising such an arrangement would take a special level of skills and development of standards to avoid abuse of such a system
467076 we must be careful which services we are doing this with and not lose the personal touch for our citizens
467077 it might later be in the form of an amendment to our constitution and specify that all money from this tax is to go toward public education and replacing at least half of the residential property tax dollars that go toward supporting public schools
467078 i support administrative fees as far as it goes to cover the costs of the existing program
467079 fees are appropriate for special services but should be kept at the minimum necessary to provide the services
467080 this is not the time for a new program nor is it the time to expand a program
467081 we should be concentrating on helping the taxpayer and hoping to maintain what we have
467082 the right to information has still not settled and it is being misused in many cases and there are characters who are not interested in rti getting into it
467083 but slowly this law will get settled it would get over the teething problems and this law will also be strengthened
467084 unless there is a desire and an instinct to give justice to your own subordinates it will not happen so far as grievance is concerned it should be resolved within the head of the department or the ministry there will be lesser litigation if we do that and the government is committed to it
467085 it is in the interest of state to address the grievances of the employees so that they can effectively serve the general populace
467086 if some are raising this issue i would like to ask that whether these laws being used are the provisions of pota which have been put into unlawful activities prevention act being used why are they not being used
467087 if the offence is committed by a person living in a state there is no difficulty in proceeding against him but there are a group of persons living in different states and they are intending to perpetrate an offence states machinery will not be helpful
467088 today we have come to conclusion that it is not only inter state matter but it is becoming international matter and now there are ramifications going outside boundaries of the country and state government and police do not have that kind of capacity
467089 if you have a federal investigating agency in such matters it would be helpful and then if you have an agency which can prevent these things that agency will be able to better prevent it

467096 we felt the imprisonment of being a girl the way it made your mind active and dreamy and how you ended up knowing which colors went together we knew that the girls were our twins that we all existed in space like animals with identical skins and that they knew everything about us though we couldnt fathom them at all we knew finally that the girls were really women in disguise that they understood love and even death and that our job was merely to create the noise that seemed to fascinate them

467106 the company knows that when people think of whole foods they automatically think of high prices
467107 we were working on this well before wal mart got into the game
467108 they are now addressing this perception of price and they are smart to
467109 we get a sense that people in the midwest tend to be more price sensitive

467126 when it clouds up it gains a lot of grip and a lot of speed when the sun breaks out it gets slick and greasy that has a lot to do with the outcome of the race and hopefully it will be just fine
467127 i think we had a pretty good baseline last time here we were pretty happy with our race car so well go back and look at those notes a lot and take what we learned yesterday with the track being a good bit different for us and try to incorporate that all into a best educated guess on what we want
467128 theres always a menu of stuff that we would like to try to improve our car like everyone else

467165 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
467166 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances
467167 for starters their editorials are decidedly liberal thats a no brainer and there are often complaints that even their general reporting is biased in subtle and not so subtle ways the new york times has come to be associated with the northeast liberal establishment
467168 you might get that base but you wont win the election
467169 it goes back to the old saying dont throw rocks at people who own ink barrels and people have gotten sick and tired of the excuse that all media is liberal

467177 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
467178 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
467179 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
467180 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
467181 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
467182 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

467265 there have been many shots fired and it is easy to pick one and blame the other side for starting all of this and it is easy for the majority to talk about the objections and stalling of bills but lets begin by talking about stalled judicial confirmations
467266 have been waiting much longer than white we are not even close to the average 15 to 17 confirmations
467267 these are lifetime appointments the president s preference is young judges in their 40s with a streak of conservative records the idea that the president is going to get every single one of his nominations its just not going to happen it never happens there are 98 other senators here besides the chairman and ranking member the president should realize that and be more useful with who he nominates

467274 if you look at judicial confirmations in a presidential year you have to go back to 1848 zachary taylor to find the last time the pace has been this slow
467275 it is becoming increasingly clear that the majority party is attempting to run out the clock in hopes of a democratic president appointing hard left judicial activists in 2009 we will not let this happen
467276 it strikes me its to their advantage to defuse this issue because around here what goes around comes around
467277 t here are few better political fights for republicans than over judicial nominations a new rasmussen study shows that the type of supreme court justices a residential candidate would appoint outranks even the war as a priority among gop voters
467278 republican senators will continue to make the point that judicial nominations need to be treated fairly and that commitments in this body need to be kept and we will use the tools available to the minority to do so until that proves to be the case this is not over i assure you

467302 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
467303 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
467304 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
467305 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
467306 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
467307 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
467308 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
467309 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances

467324 have the resources and time it takes to work toward healthier eating
467325 people fail to realise that the success of the surge was the result of a tacit agreement between the us and iran
467326 think of this step carefully before doing it because islam is a very tough religion
467327 islam is a very tough religion if you dont strive to find the key
467328 if other marine species respond similarly and theres no evidence yet that they dont then were in trouble
467329 the analogies are quite simple we observed a 25 percent reduction in fertilization success at reduced ph which is equivalent to a 25 percent reduction in the spawning stock of the species
467330 the current problem is being caused by the rate of increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere not the absolute level
467331 to put it simply the carbon dioxide is rising too quickly for the oceans natural buffering system to catch up
467332 we need to begin to respond globally to counteract the coming impacts of ocean acidification an effort requiring at least as much global participation as current efforts to stem carbon dioxide emissions
467333 i really hope im wrong about the broader implications of our work however the available evidence points to the conclusion that at present acidification is the biggest threat to the long term viability of our ocean ecosystems and especially to key invertebrate species that maintain many of the marine ecosystems on which we rely for food protection and recreation
467334 the tags primarily consist of naturally occurring pollen a substance that evolution has provided with extraordinary adhesive properties
467335 it has been given a unique chemical signature by coating it with titanium oxide zirconia silica or a mixture of other oxides the precise composition of this coating can be varied subtly from one batch of cartridges to another enabling a firm connection to be made between a particular fired cartridge and its user

467337 but our work clearly could make a valuable contribution not only to solving gun crime but also to deterring criminals from resorting to the use of firearms in the first place
467338 the revised cdc figure represents an unacceptable level of new hiv infections for a preventable disease the revised estimate underlines the need for a national aids strategy with measurable outcomes reliance on evidence based programs and sufficient funding
467339 stopping the spread of hiv and treating all people living with hiv must be a high priority for our leaders and the american public
467340 this is not just another set of statistics there are people behind these numbers people are becoming infected with a disease that is preventable we know how to prevent hiv but we have been fighting this epidemic with one hand tied behind our back reflecting a disturbing dismissal of hiv prevention as a public health priority
467341 the new higher estimate is yet one more wake up call to our national leaders that they need to do more starting with developing and implementing a real national aids strategy
467342 climate change and its expected increase in global temperatures altered circulation of air masses and effects on local and regional weather patterns are expected to have profound impacts on the foraging and migratory behavior of insects birds and bats
467343 in contrast to organisms that depend strictly on terrestrial or aquatic existence those that routinely use the aerosphere are almost immediately influenced by changing atmospheric conditions e g winds air density precipitation air temperature sunlight polarized light moonlight and geomagnetic and gravitational forces
467344 appropriate integration of diverse tools and concepts for probing into the lives of organisms aloft can help inform important ecological and evolutionary concepts and management decisions associated with the spread of invasive species emergence of infectious diseases altered biodiversity and sustainability of terrestrial aquatic and aerospheric environments

467347 just one day after president bush renewed his demand for congress to turn over more of americas natural resources to big oil exxon mobil reports the largest quarterly profit in americas history an amazing 1 485
467348 now president bush wants to start the circle again asking big oil to bail us out of our energy crisis if youre trying to quit smoking you dont ask the marlboro man for help and if youre serious about quitting your oil addiction you dont ask big oil for help
467349 dont be fooled by the big lie we cant drill and burn our way out of our energy crisis its failed americans again and again while delivering record profits for oil companies we need clean energy solutions to break americas addiction to oil give consumers real energy choices recharge our economy and help solve global warming
467350 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them
467351 the situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware
467352 its very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species they keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them without elephants there will be major habitat changes with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat
467353 elephants also are a major part of ecotourism which is an important source of hard currency for many african countries
467354 public support stopped the illegal ivory trade back in 1989 and can do so again
467355 the work with dna sampling allows us to focus law enforcement on poaching hot spots
467356 it forces countries to take more responsibility for what goes on within their borders and it also gives us more insight on where to look so that hopefully we can stop the poachers before the elephants are actually killed
467357 todays wall street journal story raises serious questions about whether wal mart is attempting to influence its workers votes
467358 decision to use valuable resources to discourage its workers from joining a union should surprise no one
467359 hardworking men and women such as average hourly employees are having a tough time making ends meet in this economy yet board of the directors and the walton family continues to prosper
467360 seiu will be looking into these matters more closely to determine if we should request an investigation
467361 the report shows that regardless of where anglo american operates what rules it plays under and who is at its helm there have been problems including worker fatalities polluted water fish kills and uprooted communities said bobby andrew a board member of nunamta aulukestai a group of eight native bristol bay corporations and villages
467362 we cant afford to risk our wild salmon on the slim promise that anglo american might do things differently in alaska
467363 committed to the highest international standards for community relations environmental protection and health and safety
467364 we wanted to get the whole story not just what anglo american wants us to know
467365 while anglo american spends millions of dollars on public relations firms this report provides alaskans with facts
467366 if anglo treats alaskans the same way it has treated people in nevada ireland and africa our wild salmon our fishing jobs and our families will suffer
467367 were blessed to live in such a beautiful place with the worlds biggest wild sockeye runs at our doorstep our wild salmon are worth more than gold
467368 risking our wild alaska salmon our families and our future on cheap promises from anglo american especially with its bad track record just doesnt make sense
467369 anglo american can hardly be considered a model of good corporate citizenship
467370 it is extraordinary that a whole nation be targeted for the promotion of a code of conduct
467371 it sheds light on the importance that other nations place on good manners and civility here we have a developing nation that wants to put its best face forward in an international arena in order to be accepted as a full partner in the world
467372 the u s anthrax attacks stand nearly alone in our database and anthrax has been used as a terror weapon very infrequently since 1970
467373 in 1993 the japanese group aum shinri kyo attempted to disperse anthrax in tokyo and in the area around japans parliament both attacks failed in fact there have only been a handful of bio chemical attacks of any type on record and perhaps the most prominent ones go back to aum shinri kyos sarin attacks in tokyo in the 1990s
467374 relative to explosives you need a lot of bio chemical materials to inflict mass casualties and the materials must be handled very carefully
467375 that doesnt mean bio chemical weapons dont pose a global terrorism database university of marylandserious potential hazard but so far at least they have not been the weapon of choice
467376 if the investigation by mother jones proves true then the nra will have effectively spied on our ongoing efforts to keep visitors and wildlife safe in our national parks if true this is a troubling display of the lengths to which the nra will go to further its agenda
467377 we selected this environment to test our wimax solution because in a normal city or town you have plenty of communications channels such as umts telephony or adsl
467378 it is in extremely remote areas that it makes sense to use this wireless technology
467379 there are some coverage problems with the mobile version of wimax says martufi
467380 when you go indoors for example the coverage of mobile wimax decreases it would be interesting to develop a seamless connection allowing you to move from mobile wimax to your home network that uses wifi
467381 massachusetts is showing that were willing to lead to take responsibility for our share of a problem that has major ramifications for our state and the world
467382 our state has the brainpower and infrastructure to help solve this challenge and now thanks to the governor legislative leadership and engaged citizens we have the political will
467383 leading u s scientists and economists including a number of nobel prize winners recently released a letter imploring policymakers to require immediate and deep cuts in global warming emissions
467384 if emissions are not reduced by late this century summers in massachusetts could resemble summers today in south carolina
467385 boston for example could average almost a month every summer with temperatures over 100 degrees that would significantly threaten public health
467386 we have the technology and know how to cut emissions today this measure will spur needed investment in advanced technologies that will move us into a clean energy future
467387 massachusetts and other states have demonstrated that they have the political will to embrace solutions to climate change at the local level
467388 but were still waiting for our federal lawmakers to take responsibility and seriously address the most critical threat weve ever faced in our lifetime
467389 the presence of a linear field of geothermal features is evidence of a planar rift extending to considerable depth in the crust
467390 this new evidence indicates that the region is more complicated than we previously thought
467391 the extension of the san andreas does not appear to be active it is probably a very old part of the fault and helps to explain the larger more complex transition area between the imperial fault and san andreas fault called the brawley seismic zone
467392 we welcome the increased focus by federal agencies on recovery of threatened and endangered species
467393 under the endangered species act and other federal laws federal agencies managing federal lands have a special obligation to conserve viable populations of plants and animals including threatened and endangered species this requirement does not apply to private lands of course making federal lands key to the conservation of threatened and endangered species the new recovery crediting system guidance must not be allowed to undermine this duty instead it should encourage federal land conservation efforts in addition to conservation efforts on private and state lands
467394 this challenge cannot be solved without us leadership this study is a roadmap a wake up call
467395 food security is so fundamental to human existence that it is not only a humanitarian issue but also perhaps the key security issue of our time
467396 keeping statistics on animal cruelty crimes will help law enforcement analyze trends that could save human lives its important to note that jeffrey dahmer progressed from cutting up animals to cutting up humans and eating them albert desalvo the boston strangler killed 13 women before his capture he also began by cruelly killing animals ted bundy david son of sam berkowitz ted unabomber kaczynski and kip kinkel who killed his parents and two schoolmates in a bloody rampage all had a history of torturing animals
467397 its an accepted principle that those who are kind to animals are also kind to people and those who are cruel to animals are a threat to society and may commit other violent crimes
467398 having the ability to track animal cruelty cases anywhere in the country is a long overdue step that would not only help animals but would also give law enforcement agencies the tools they need to prevent violent offenders from escalating their terrible behavior congress should quickly pass this anti crime bill for the sake of animals and for public safety and security in our communities
467399 criminologist jack levin conducted a three year study that concluded animal abusers are five times more likely to commit violence against humans animal abusers also are more likely to damage property and use drugs the fbi u s department of education and the u s department of justice consider animal cruelty to be one of the early warning signs of potential violence by youths
467400 there is too much at stake to ignore these crimes

467402 nobody else no other school has been challenged by issues related to race to the extent we have experienced at ole miss
467403 and probably no university in america has made the progress on race that we have made most objective observers would conclude that our university is a model for the nation
467404 ole miss is a step above every other major institution in america
467405 thats why ole miss is best poised to deal with race they know more about the issue
467406 despite obvious and understandable hostility from some students we had a civilized discussion about the constitution and how our government of laws worked
467407 i have always felt that with that discussion ole miss began to learn and profit from the terrible events of the night before
467408 in our efforts to solve the problems of race and two centuries of discrimination against blacks together blacks and whites have obviously made significant and remarkable progress in higher education ole miss has to its great credit been in the forefront
467409 in many cases ole miss and mississippi are viewed from a 60s perspective rather than a 2008 perspective
467410 when the debate takes place people are going to see ole miss today oxford today and mississippi today this is a wonderful opportunity for that perception to be updated
467411 throughout southern history you have a biracial culture and a biracial way of life you have people from west africa and western europe interacting on an uneven playing ground essentially creating a blend of western civilization and third world life only recently are we really beginning to understand that story its fascinating
467412 on one hand the south has been solidly republican on the other hand mississippi is where barack obama wins primaries
467413 in many ways the south has been the most prosperous part of the country for years at the same time we still have rural poverty underperforming schools and the highest infant mortality rate the complexities of the south are still here
467414 issues like racism and social segregation have not been high on my list of priorities during my time in oxford
467415 i came to realize that my position while convenient was rather narrow minded something really does need to change
467416 there are plenty of problems to be solved one by one they wont happen quickly and you may not notice the difference but my eyes are a little more open this retreat is a step in the right direction
467417 we are saying here is the race story at ole miss here is where we were in 1962 and heres where we are today yes we have a history that includes inappropriate behavior in regards to race but our current state of affairs is a model for the nation
467418 i know there are at least 80 people on this campus who desire change
467419 as members of the ole miss family we have the right and the responsibility to do what we can to make this a place where we all feel connected
467420 it will require communication effort time and patience but the goal of an integrated diverse ole miss is worth the work it takes to get there
467421 self determination equality property an adequate standard of living and freedom of movement
467422 a process that has as its ultimate goal the dissolution of the palestinians existence as a legitimate social political and economic entity
467423 healthcare services have taken the first steps in minimising the risk of another shipman this is important in improving patient safety and it is to be welcomed
467424 much work is still necessary to embed the new networks and ensure that concerns about controlled drugs are picked up investigated and where necessary acted upon
467425 we owe it to shipmans victims and their relatives to be vigilant in ensuring that controlled drugs are managed safely and effectively
467426 it is known that ports are contaminated what we are investigating is to what extent the contaminants therein reach aquatic organisms
467427 we take mussels from clean waters and place them at points we wish to analyse in order to see how much and what kind of contamination is accumulated
467428 the galician biologists are in charge of studying the consequences of the contaminants on the mussels we measure the concentration of the contaminants received by the mussels
467429 today tbt is banned but it is highly durable and it can still be found in waters
467430 these last are similar to dioxines and in the past were used in very powerful transformers they are also prohibited but are still present in the water
467431 we place 20 or 30 mussels mounted on plastic supports and inside gauzes and submerge them at a depth of two metres
467432 after a certain period we collect them for analysis of level and type of contamination accumulated
467433 in some cases the contamination is high and the mussels can die
467434 by using polymeric mountings we simulate chemically what the mussels do i e accumulate contaminants
467435 the situation in the port of bilbao is quite homogenous we have taken samples in the areas of getxo santurce and the exterior port bilbao in the basque country and the results are similar in each case on the other hand in vigo galicia we detected wide differences from one zone to another for example between water near a shipyard and the open sea
467436 we wish to know if our methodology and the sampling tools that we have developed are useful for this purpose
467437 on the one hand we have seen that zones supposedly clean are not as clean as we thought it is necessary to redefine the selection of these clean zones on the other we are also perfecting the tool that chemically simulates the role of the mussels in order to carry out even more precise sampling
467438 who is taking me up where am i being taken and what will happen to me once i get there what kind of choices will i have
467439 well if i stop blaming the other person for what they did they will start blaming me
467440 what about events that seem to happen out of nowhere
467441 im doing it again somewhere in my thought processes i am still creating this
467442 how many times have i been teased about an exciting opportunity that suddenly fails
467443 im not going to do this again im going to try another way
467444 no no i dont want to not have enough money

467446 i and state your name call forth the power the intuition the conscious knowledge wisdom faith and trust into my physical reality empowering me to utilise the gifts of patience as i do this i open my energy to integrate the grids of divine timing and in so doing placing my trust in all my divine aspects including spirit and in so doing surrendering to god goddess because i know they are taking care of everything i call forth the power and the light of the empowering amplified chakra grids of my divine sacred template and i consciously choose to weave those advanced illuminated and wise grids into the chakric grids of my current lifetime and command this energy to extend into the chakric grids of all my parallel and alternate lifetime aspects i command this under grace to manifest in peace miraculously and divinely i command the light of my empowered self to merge fully with the consciousness held within the grids of my chakras and in so doing consciously consenting and willing the dissemination of every single energy and attachment on a physical emotional mental spiritual and multi dimensional level that keeps me within a state of fear inhibition and frustration i order the divine timing of my divine plan of my current life and the divine pathway thereof to come into full physical manifestation here and now in accordance with the sacred grids of my plan and purpose i command this and order this from the depths of light and truth within my most evolved loving self and in so doing placing the grids of intention into the realms of integrity perfection and divinity so it is and so it is done
467447 our compliance system had failures and misconduct appears to have occurred
467448 it is apparent now that our controls and supervision were inadequate
467449 this is a bit bittersweet being the last old timers day at yankee stadium and its aug 2 which is the day of my husbands accident
467450 but to be with the people who loved him and to share the feeling we all have thats the amazing thing about coming back to new york

467453 its obviously very important to me what happens to that locker and im so grateful to mr steinbrenner for the tribute to thurman leaving it empty for 29 years
467454 vogue has sometimes been called a civilizing force if that is true perhaps it is because a civilization to endure needs voices to sing its praise a part of civilization is a regard for the gifted an admiration of beauty an understanding of the arts the arts of daily living as well as the arts of painting or sculpture writing or music or architecture civilization has in it too respect for the boldness of the frontiersmen in the sciences and in all the worlds of abstract ideas

467484 i mean he was beautiful enough to convince you that he wasnt even real you know those impossibly good looking people on the poster he was an idol but when he sang he turned into an idol with a beating heart do you get what i mean
467485 he wrote songs about love of course but more about its consequence
467486 alone on the street with nowhere to go industry washed up and friends all gone out one by one like the ash on my cigarette my soul made a tiny noise the night the heart within you died for the first time you were so refined in the ways you never smiled in a crowd of people never saying a single thing tonight lets come together and lick our wounds well fuck them all mock the world and find love as a blanket to curl up in
467487 maybe im just getting older but when i see kamenashi kazuyas eyes fill with tears and beg me not to leave in a video i dont want to hold him because i know when the song is over hell be alright
467488 the discovery of a boundless country seems worthy of consideration
467489 liberal education which consists in the constant intercourse with the greatest minds is a training in the highest form of modesty not to say of humility
467490 for truly barren is profane education which is always in labor but never gives birth for what fruit worthy of such pangs does philosophy show for being so long in labor do not all who are full of wind and never come to term miscarry before they come to light of the knowledge of god although they could as well become men if they were not altogether hidden in the womb of barren wisdom it is true that he who looks to both the profane doctrines and to the doctrines of the fathers will find himself between two antagonists pagan philosophy says that the soul is immortal this is a pious offspring but it also says that souls pass from bodies to bodies and are changed from a rational to an irrational nature and one could describe in some detail how good doctrines are contaminated by profane philosophys absurd additions when these are completely removed the angel of god comes to us in mercy as if rejoicing in the true offspring of these doctrines
467491 anyone who made an intelligent collection of the asinine stupidities of human wisdom would have a wondrous tale to tell i like collecting such things as evidence which from some angles can be studied as usefully as sane and moderate opinions we can judge what we should think of man of his sense and of his reason when we find such obvious and gross errors even in these important characters who have raised human intelligence to great heights personally i prefer to believe that they treated knowledge haphazardly sporting with it in a fashion like a toy and that they played with reason as if it were some vain and frivolous instrument putting forward all kinds of thoughts and fancies some forceful others weak the selfsame plato who defined man as a capon elsewhere follows socrates and says that in truth he does not know what man is and that man is one of the hardest things in the world to understand with such varied and unstable opinions they lead us tacitly by the hand to inconclusive conclusions they profess that they do no present the face of their thought openly and unveiled they hide it beneath obscurities of poetic fable or behind some other mask our imperfection is such that raw meat is not always proper food for our stomachs it first has to be dried treated or hung they do the same they sometimes take their straightforward opinions and judgments and hide them behind obscurity and season them with falsehood so as to prepare them for public consumption they do not want to make an express avowal of the ignorance and weakness of human reason they want to avoid frightening the children but they give us a good glimpse of it beneath the appearance of confused and unstable erudition
467492 through the influence of his book he may guide the understanding that others have of the nature of things including human nature this guidance may have important effects on peoples conception of the proper way of life and consequently on the political arrangement to secure it
467493 rather than stating or even implying any firm conclusions montaigne draws the responsive reader into an active process of discovery allowing the reader to participate directly in the epistemological lesson to be learned and even leading him on in such a way that his own judgment will serve to illustrate the vanity and inconstancy of human judgment
467494 my ideas follow one another but sometimes it is from a distance and look at each other but with a sidelong glance
467495 true he will afterward repent of having perplexed himself about it
467496 but do you suppose that he would ever have enquired into or learned what he fancied that he knew though he was really ignorant of it until he had fallen into perplexity under the idea that he did not know and had desired to know
467497 as a result of continued application to the subject itself and communion therewith and is brought to birth in the soul on a sudden as light that is kindled by a leaping spark and thereafter it nourishes itself
467498 what good can we suppose it did varro and aristotle to know many things did it exempt them from human discomforts were they freed from the accidents that oppress a janitor
467499 in much wisdom is much grief and he that acquires knowledge acquires travail and torment
467500 the ignorance that was naturally in us we have by long study confirmed and verified
467501 a peaceful and sedate condition of life exempt from the agitations we receive through the impression of the opinion and knowledge we think we have of things whence are born fear avarice envy immoderate desires ambition pride superstition love of novelty rebellion disobedience obstinacy and most bodily ills
467502 the means i take to beat down this frenzy and which seems fittest to me is to crush and trample underfoot human arrogance and pride to make them feel the inanity the vanity the nothingness of man to wrest from their hands the puny weapons of their reason to make them bow their heads and bite the ground beneath the authority and reverence of divine majesty
467503 is it possible to imagine anything so ridiculous as that this miserable and puny creature who is not even master of himself exposed to the attacks of all things should call himself master and emperor of the universe the least part of which it is not in his power to know much less to command
467504 we are not allowed not to know what we do not know
467505 everything under the heavens say the wise follows a similar law and fortune
467506 i establish nothing i do not understand i halt i examine
467507 i take for my guide custom and my senses by alternative reasoning i am unable to understand not anymore without examining the other side
467508 for man the ultimate knowledge is to approve of things as they are
467509 breath fills a goatskin as opinion fills a hollow head
467510 not more this than that why this and not that
467511 all in the heavens earth and the seas are nothing in comparison to the immensity of the universe
467512 have you seen a man that believes himself wise hope that he be a fool
467513 because you ignore how the soul and body are one you do not know the work of god
467514 it is to her alone the divine majesty that knowledge and wisdom belong
467515 man you do not know whether this or that is convenient for you or whether either is truly necessary
467516 i am human let nothing human be foreign to me
467517 do not be wiser than necessary in fear of becoming stupid
467518 do not be more knowledgeable than needed rather be soberly wise
467519 of what no man has known perhaps none may ever know
467520 doubt whether the life we live is life or whether it is that which we call death which follows life
467521 your justice for us is as strong as the mountains your judgments as profound as an abyss
467522 why load down your soul with ambitions it cannot carry

467524 there is no reason that does not have its opposite says the wisest school of philosophers
467525 points us to a life comfortable with the customs of our country and its laws and institutions and to our own instinctive feelings
467526 he who affirms that god exists either declares that he has or that he has not forethought for the things in the universe and in the former case that such forethought is for all things or for some things but if he had forethought for all there would have been nothing bad and no badness in the world yet all things they say are full of badness hence it shall not be said that god forethinks all things if again he forethinks some why does he forethink these things and not those for either he has both the will and the power to forethink all things or else he has the will but not the power or the power but not the will or neither the will nor the power but if he had had both the will and the power he would have had forethought for all things but for the reasons stated above he does not forethink all therefore he has not both the will and the power to forethink all and if he has the will but not the power he is less strong than the cause which renders him unable to forethink what he does not forethink but it is contrary to our notion of god that he should be weaker than anything and if again he has the power but not the will to have forethought for all he will be held to be malignant while if he has neither the will nor the power he is both malignant and weak an impious thing to say about god therefore god has no forethought for the universe
467527 i know well that when i hear someone dwell on the language of these essays i would rather he said nothing this is not so much to extol the style as to depreciate the sense the more galling for being more oblique yet i am much mistaken if many other writers offer more to take hold of in their materials than i do and whether for better or for worse if any writer has sown his materials more substantially or at least more thickly on his paper in order to get more in i pile up only the headings of subjects were i to add on their consequences i would multiply this volume many times over and how many stories have i spread around which say nothing of themselves but from which anyone who troubles to pluck them with a little ingenuity will produce numberless essays neither these stories nor my quotations serve always simply for example authority or ornament i do not esteem them solely for the use i derive from them they often bear outside my subject the seeds of a richer and bolder material and sound obliquely a subtler sound note both for myself who do not wish to express anything more and for those who get my drift
467528 irresolution seems to me the most common and apparent defect of our nature
467529 it has often seemed to me that even good authors are wrong to insist on fashioning a consistent and solid fabric out of us
467530 always to will the same things and always to oppose the same things
467531 they abandoned themselves to pleasures as if they were to die on the morrow

467539 the laws of conscience which we say are born from nature are born of custom each man holding in inward veneration the opinions and the behavior approved and accepted around him obeys custom in all his actions and thoughts

467541 if it is true that every complete society necessarily recognizes something about which it is absolutely forbidden to laugh we may say that the determination to transgress that prohibition sanza alcuno rispetto with absolutely no respect is the essence of machiavellis intention
467542 if a wise man is silent about a fact that is commonly held to be important for the subject he discusses he gives us to understand that that fact is unimportant the silence of the wise man is always meaningful it cannot be explained by forgetfulness
467543 for to speak the truth is only sensible when one speak to wise men
467544 one can express ones disagreement with the common view simply by failing to take notice of it this is in fact the most effective way of showing ones disapproval
467545 the leader of an army must not believe in an error which an enemy evidently commits for there will always be fraud beneath it
467546 if a prudent and strong enemy commits a manifest blunder there will always be fraud beneath it
467547 for sometime ive never said what i believe and i never believe what i say and if it sometime occurs to me that i say the truth i conceal it among so many lies that it is hard to find out

467581 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
467582 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
467583 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
467584 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
467585 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil

467590 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
467591 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
467592 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
467593 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
467594 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
467595 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
467596 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us

467603 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance

467619 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
467620 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
467621 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
467622 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
467623 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
467624 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
467625 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
467626 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
467627 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
467628 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
467629 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
467630 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
467631 in theology endless mistakes result from supposing that the conditions bounds and limits of our finite existence apply to god the doctrine of his aseity meaning that god has life in himself and draws his unending energy from himself stands as a bulwark against such mistakes in our life of faith we easily impoverish ourselves by embracing an idea of god that is too limited and small and again the doctrine of gods aseity stands as a bulwark to stop this happening it is vital for spiritual health to believe that god is great cf ps 95 1 7 and grasping the truth of his aseity is the first step on the road to doing this
467632 i am reading joshua harris book love it he talks about the people who believe they can be christians and never go to church i have heard this argument many times they dont believe you have to fellowship

467637 there are few things sadder in life then watching someone walk away after they left you watching the distance between your bodies expand until there is nothing left but empty space and silence

467639 instead of thinking about what youre missing try thinking about what you have that everyone else is missing
467640 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god

467643 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
467644 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
467645 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
467646 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
467647 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass

467649 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say

467652 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
467653 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
467654 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
467655 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
467656 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
467657 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
467658 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
467659 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
467660 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
467661 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
467662 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
467663 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
467664 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
467665 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
467666 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
467667 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
467668 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
467669 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
467670 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
467671 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
467672 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
467673 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
467674 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
467675 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
467676 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
467677 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
467678 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
467679 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
467680 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

467684 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
467685 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
467686 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
467687 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
467688 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
467689 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
467690 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
467691 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
467692 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights

467698 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
467699 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
467700 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
467701 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
467702 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
467703 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
467704 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
467705 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
467706 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
467707 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
467708 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
467709 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
467710 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
467711 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
467712 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
467713 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
467714 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
467715 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
467716 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
467717 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
467718 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
467719 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
467720 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
467721 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
467722 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
467723 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
467724 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
467725 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
467726 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
467727 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
467728 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
467729 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
467730 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
467731 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
467732 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
467733 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
467734 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
467735 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
467736 if i listened to what every bitch in new york city said about me id never leave the house
467737 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
467738 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
467739 if the license holder has failed to meet commitments to players
467740 the situation will really be solved in the next few days
467741 the lga initiated an investigation and along the way reported that there was no software error
467742 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
467743 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
467744 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
467745 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
467746 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
467747 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
467748 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
467749 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
467750 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
467751 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
467752 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
467753 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
467754 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
467755 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
467756 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
467757 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
467758 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
467759 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
467760 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
467761 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
467762 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
467763 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
467764 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
467765 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
467766 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
467767 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
467768 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
467769 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
467770 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
467771 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
467772 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
467773 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
467774 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
467775 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
467776 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
467777 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
467778 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
467779 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
467780 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
467781 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
467782 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
467783 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
467784 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
467785 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
467786 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
467787 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
467788 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
467789 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
467790 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
467791 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
467792 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
467793 if the vice president says its do able i believe
467794 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
467795 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
467796 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
467797 the road is extremely narrow and if you have to reverse down this is potentially an accident waiting to happen
467798 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
467799 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night

467807 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
467808 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
467809 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
467810 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
467811 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
467812 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
467813 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
467814 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
467815 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
467816 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
467817 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature

467824 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
467825 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
467826 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
467827 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
467828 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
467829 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
467830 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
467831 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
467832 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
467833 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
467834 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
467835 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
467836 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
467837 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
467838 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
467839 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
467840 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
467841 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
467842 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
467843 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
467844 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
467845 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
467846 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
467847 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
467848 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
467849 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
467850 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
467851 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
467852 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
467853 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
467854 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
467855 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
467856 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
467857 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
467858 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
467859 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
467860 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
467861 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
467862 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

467879 enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
467880 thus what gore offered july 17 was not so much a
467881 of course the greatest obstacle to meeting the challenge may be the deep dysfunction of our politics and our self governing system as it exists today in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
467882 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
467883 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
467884 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
467885 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
467886 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
467887 the uks gambling commission is after betfair and betdaq for in running in play betting
467888 youre going to have to make many different calls to handle all the information when using a bot so i would say non uk users are at a significant disadvantage

467890 evidence that we have seen to date indicates that the market for in running betting is in fact made up predominantly of specialist and knowledgeable betting customers
467891 this is backed up by analysis which shows a success rate percentage for in running betting with one company being slightly higher than successful bets made ante post that is prior to the event to which the bet relates starting
467892 however the commission would like to see further evidence on this issue
467893 just testing again it says my post consists of spam
467894 maltas lotteries and gaming authority is a stricter regulator than the uks gambling commission on that point
467895 the american enterprise institutes proposals to legalize real money prediction markets in the united states of america
467896 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
467897 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
467898 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey

467923 it was a blissful experience meeting swami ramdev his yoga techniques are simply splendid
467924 many of us in the washington dc area have been ardent admirers of swamiji already but the recent yoga camp has electrified dc and the surrounding community there is a new wave of enthusiasm and people are joining hands toward the collective pursuit and promotion of knowledge imparted by swamiji my wife yog and i were privileged to have hosted a most remarkable dialogue between swami ramdevji and a vast number of physicians it was an eye opener for us to learn how many doctors are also utilizing swamijis teachings already

467937 kovalainen is pushing me hard but thats a good thing
467938 we didnt seem to be very strong this morning but looking at the lap times from the first two sessions i think we are there
467939 the lap wasnt perfect the traffic meant i couldnt prepare my tires
467940 he did a better job but im still in a good position i can imagine tomorrow i think it will be an interesting race
467941 the car wasnt too bad but i went off and couldnt stay on the circuit
467942 it isnt like we havent been here in two or three years we were just here six weeks ago so everybody kind of knows what to expect as far as the track goes
467943 when it clouds up it gains a lot of grip and a lot of speed when the sun breaks out it gets slick and greasy that has a lot to do with the outcome of the race and hopefully it will be just fine
467944 i think we had a pretty good baseline last time here we were pretty happy with our race car so well go back and look at those notes a lot and take what we learned yesterday with the track being a good bit different for us and try to incorporate that all into a best educated guess on what we want
467945 theres always a menu of stuff that we would like to try to improve our car like everyone else
467946 and a lot of these teams have a lot more experience here than us but with the car of tomorrow everybody is trying to build a new catalog of tools in their chest to improve their car for certain things
467947 im still learning the plays and it will get easier the more i play with them
467948 most people love to see a neat yard decorated with splashes of bright colors spread from the driveway to the front door it tells that the occupant enjoys and appreciates the splendor of nature
467949 it makes people want to stop their busy day to absorb the tranquility while sitting on a chair or laying on a hammock in the midst of natures glory

467956 i might use my inhaler a little more than normal but i havent had to so far
467957 the best way you get ready for pollution is by staying out of it as long as possible
467958 i went out there and tried to set up some hurdles and they wouldnt let me do it extremely helpful
467959 its one of those things where its only out there when people bring it up
467960 im not thinking about that im just thinking about getting a medal right now if there is air pollution its going to affect everyone not just me
467961 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
467962 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
467963 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
467964 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
467965 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
467966 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
467967 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
467968 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
467969 ich entschuldige mich nicht f r etwas wof r wir nicht verantwortlich sind
467970 es kann nicht sein dass selbst im deutschen haus in peking deutsche zeitungen nicht ausgelegt werden d rfen hier muss die bundesregierung eine deutliche sprache sprechen
467971 die olympischen spiele leben von offenheit und freiem austausch als gastgeber sollte china selbst das gr te interesse daran haben diesem geist gerecht zu werden deswegen hat sich china gegen ber dem ioc auch zur einhaltung der olympischen werte verpflichtet
467972 ich begr e dass die chinesische seite die bedeutung dieser frage erkannt und einige entscheidungen berdacht hat
467973 im interesse der berichterstatter und somit auch im interesse unserer athletinnen und athleten erwarte ich auch vom ioc dass auf die einhaltung der chinesischen zusagen geachtet wird
467974 die chinesen scheinen einzusehen dass freiheit und menschenrechte die beste basis f r eine gute zukunft sind
467975 a sophisticated and creative blog that pokes rambunctious irreverent and most of all sexy fun at the game of poker and everyone who is connected with it
467976 youve made me so angry i wish i could reach into my screen and just pound your scummy worthless head in
467977 if you ask me you should just go straight to wicked chops poker instead these guys are awesome
467978 wicked chops is wickedly funny and wickedly irreverent and posts a lot of photos of wickedly attractive women if that aint poker what is
467979 is there a draft in here bobcats future is on the clock
467980 look at gerald wallaces team effect rather than his net stat effect
467981 there are substantial other elements of the deal that simply are not working for example as interpreted by the courts the current cba effectively prohibits the clubs from recouping bonuses paid to players who subsequently breach their player contacts or refuse to perform that is simply irrational and unfair to both fans and players who honor their contracts also irrational is that in the current system some rookies are able to secure contracts that pay them more than top proven veterans
467982 the quarterback competition is an open competition and they are both coming in on equal ground we havent named a starter they both know that weve been evaluating them since we started offseason workouts i see it going into the preseason seeing what happens during the games and then making a decision from there
467983 how many points are the bears going to score youre looking for the defense to score one touchdown and devin hester to score one touchdown
467984 owners opt out of cba qb controversies and afc amp nfc west 2008 nfl draft recaps
467985 is it possible lebron is underrated after game 7 loss interleague only matters in nyc
467986 we take it very serious hes being punished severely its an act thats inexcusable and it cant happen
467987 those are the ones they get paid in thats the way well operate and thats the way the landscape is
467988 it could have been worse not that a broken nose is not bad enough but well treat it as we go
467989 its an internal matter im not trying to be secretive these are the kind of matters well keep in house were doing it the right way
467990 were going to help him hes still ours yet he is going to have conditions he knows what those are and were going to move forward
467991 you lose guys to injuries the other guys have got to step up its an opportunity for them and weve got to move forward
467992 they certainly took a real leap of faith with us at that point coming off of a 1 11 season all of them had different reasons some had other options some didnt everybody just felt like this was the place that they could see things happening
467993 i knew i always had it because i was a leader on my high school team so it wasnt new to me but being out for the season there wasnt anything i could do about it except be positive and be an outspoken guy and make sure that everyones on the same page that was the starting point me being out in 2005
467994 the moment i saw eric foster walking down the sideline
467995 we knew coming into this game that we were a lot faster theyre big and strong but our defense is predicated on speed we knew we had to pressure brohm we knew we had to frustrate him we knew he was their team
467996 this should be one of the nfls tightest quarterback races this summer
467997 my fantasy team didnt do well because player x didnt perform
467998 i can confirm that usain will run both the 100m 200m in beijing
467999 you really shouldnt be able to fail a test like that and play in this league to begin with
468000 to make the pro bowl and all the other awards i think youre walking a fine line of sending the wrong message
468001 thats a storybook ending right there manny getting traded here and coming up representing the winning run
468002 but brandon made some quality pitches and got the double play hes done his job pretty well all year
468003 i was just trying to see the ball and hit it he made a good pitch and got me out but tomorrows another day
468004 my mechanics have fallen into place over the last three or four games and im able to throw all of my pitches over for strikes now and stay away from the big inning
468005 throwing first pitch strikes i had some easy innings and it allowed me to stay out there
468006 hes got great stuff i mean you can see why theyre pretty excited about him
468007 i think he was throwing a little harder than the gun would suggest he had a real good curveball and it seemed like he could throw it all counts hes definitely something to be excited about
468008 mannys obviously a big bat in their lineup and hopefully he pays dividends for them after we leave
468009 everybody can be pitched to but hes one person that can change a lineup and make hitters around him better if you make a bad pitch which i have against him at times hes going to do what he does best so to give him two singles today including an infield hit im pretty happy with that
468010 this was really all about how good the rockets are
468011 this is what this game was about the lakers coming in here at the top of the western conference this game determined where we are we answered those questions we took on that challenge and were standing alone
468012 were a confident bunch right now confident but not cocky
468013 they have quality players they work hard and you can see the chemistry
468014 whats good is were getting four or five people in double figures every night so were not relying on just tracy trying to get 41 points that says a lot about us and our team and how everyone has turned their games up
468015 in my 11 years in the nba thats the best defense ive ever seen
468016 and the winner of season six of dancing with the stars is kristi and mark
468017 you will not meet a more driven young man than jamey richard the amount of work that kid did this summer between lifting and getting ready for the season and putting time into his internship its inspirational
468018 jamey is really the anchor on that o line he takes care of his guys while i kind of take care of the skill guys he is real tough every single play at the end you see him getting one last push in or one last block he goes all out to the whistle
468019 after talking to colts president bill polian for about a minute he told me to stop stressing because they were taking me right now i thought it was impossible knowing that only five centers had been drafted two by the colts already but sure enough i wasnt dreaming and i was the 6th and final center selected in the draft i was on the phone with coach dungy when my name scrolled across the screen my family started going crazy and i had to walk away so that i could hear what coach was actually saying to me while i was on the phone with the colts i got about 45 text messages and within 10 minutes of it being shown on espn that i had been drafted i got at least 100 calls from friends and family it was easily the best moment of my life
468020 i wasnt expecting anything until the fifth sixth or seventh round and thats when teams started to contact me carolina called and even new england patriots defensive coordinator and former kent state coach dean pees called but nobody pulled the trigger it was kind of stressful and frustrating but everything happens for a reason
468021 colts president bill polian called me to make it official he said he thought i was a great fit for the colts that theyd been watching me but didnt draft me because they wanted to build their offensive line he said they wanted me to be their first free agent signing
468022 if you cut off the play at the head qb then the tail wr will die and that is what we will strive to do on every down
468023 this years defense will be one to remember for a very long time
468024 to be the best you have to beat the best
468025 im kinda done celebrating the super bowl ill save my super bowl flashbacks for several years from now when i am sitting on my porch drinking moonshine
468026 a lot of people picked us to finish dead last in the nfc east last season this is really nothing new to us we dont view it as a sign of disrespect nobody picked us in the playoffs or the super bowl except for giants fans anyway
468027 thats all right thats ok youre gonna work for us someday
468028 he was the architect the godfather the don the patriarch
468029 thanks donnie whwn oneal return week ahead amp where they stand

468040 the knee looks wonderful and we are anticipating that within a short period of time he will start training
468041 the doctors told him the knee was doing better than expected
468042 im not in too much pain only when i bend it
468043 i dont think its serious at all i can move it left and right just to take a step forward is the only thing that really hurts i never heard a pop
468044 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
468045 ive been coming 90 minutes early every day to get treatment
468046 of course i wanted to push the ball a little more and run and get everybody else involved and i was able to do that
468047 the knee is fine i just jammed it a little bit and i should be all right they had to sit me out because i hurt my knee i wanted to get back in but they just told me to sit back down when i made my last layup i jump stopped and i landed a little too hard on it
468048 i was mad today but i knew they wasnt going to play me so i was just going to have to suck it up
468049 i could have played but they said dont worry about it this is just the summer
468050 rose is a very competitive player and sitting out is going to be tough for him but it is a very safe decision
468051 the bulls are just more cautious i could have played today but they told me not to
468052 like at memphis it took me a time to get used to the offense and get used to my teammates other than that its going to be a great time
468053 hes a great player on the pick and roll and hes going to be someone wholl be very tough to guard
468054 so i think i played horrible but tomorrows a new day

468060 an nba source said the celtics surprisingly worked out blazers free agent small forward darius miles yesterday and he had an impressive workout miles missed last season while recovering from knee surgery
468061 dont try to recruit me i did not climb to the top of the food chain to eat carrots
468062 you only get so many chances to get your game to the next level and to be able to be a starter
468063 hes been told hell be given every opportunity to win that job
468064 i had a good conversation with tony and i assured tony that this doesnt necessarily close the book for him here we like tony hes just moving forward in his career if things might not work out with james or other free agents tony would be a guy that wed be interested in returning to the celtics
468065 the celtics hope to sign a veteran backup point guard to a one year veteran minimum contract an nba source said candidates include eddie house who would return for a second season with boston dallass tyronn lue orlandos keyon dooling miamis jason williams and chicagos chris duhon
468066 you would have to say the low point of the season right now for the red sox
468067 fireside chats 14 where we talk to frank more about the rays than the yankees
468068 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
468069 chris all around game could blossom under an offensive coach like mike dantoni no one knows what will happen at this point and who knows where things will end up but the knicks are a team we would hope would be genuinely interested chris is only 25 so he has room to grow
468070 he has shown the ability to distribute the ball but he can also shoot from the perimeter
468071 he hasnt always been allowed to do that his defense of course everybody knows about thats unquestioned
468072 there is a rumor that the knicks signed chris duhon to a 2 year deal and nobody on this site even posts an update forget this site im never coming back
468073 mess with the bull get the horns got the point

468081 my worst days are behind me and my best days ahead of me nobody thought i had narcolepsy people thought i was just lazy and slept a lot
468082 id just say that some things i could have done better
468083 im not scared to dribble or shoot it from anywhere i like to pass the ball i like to do everything on the court that you can do on offense maybe by looking at me or reading my stat line you might not notice that but in due time youll see
468084 it aint no good if it is not build here thinking
468085 re ug community ultimate guitar com do you considor yourself punk
468086 8 player deal on draft day brings new wolves into the den
468087 he felt it was best for the team for me to be at the 2 guard and get shots in and score some points for our team
468088 i agree with everything that omar in beaverton just said very good phone call there
468089 hes got an incredible wingspan and great feet and we feel that defensively he can be an nba player right away
468090 the other things well work on but we really like him we didnt necessarily draft a guy for position we drafted a guy that we liked and we didnt really care if it was a point guard that we liked we would have drafted him if it was a center i think giddens is more of a two three in some ways
468091 we felt one of our weaknesses is we were very skilled but we were not very athletic as a group
468092 he was very competitive in that workout his team lost a couple of games and you could see from how he reacted that he didnt like it
468093 seeing him work out helped me more than danny ainge danny has seen these guys but the workout sold me on liking him
468094 second the team we have will make him better hes not as mature as i would like to see and hes not as disciplined as our guys are but they will help him to achieve both things
468095 i really like j r hes athletic skilled a great in between game
468096 he has a chance to fight for minutes right away because of his defense
468097 i never thought about the celtics until i worked out for them
468098 after that i was just praying to be part of it now im going to a place with so much history and tradition i put my heart out on the line im totally blessed to be part of it im long and athletic and thats one way that ill be able to get time with my defense my strength is my compassion to compete and my will to win alford played a big role in letting me go out and play with confidence to stay composed he gave me the ball in big time situations

468102 its one of the most traditionally great schools there is it hasnt completely hit me yet that i am going to be playing at the university of michigan but it will pretty soon there have been a lot of great players to go through there and hopefully i can be one of them ive got my grandparents my aunts and uncles all in detroit its just good because i can have my grandparents and my cousins come to my games whereas with alabama i dont know if theyd ever be able to come see me play i can probably go to my grandparents house after games on saturdays and its just something that felt really comfortable
468103 i ended up picking michigan over kansas because kansas and texas a amp m were the two schools that were up there with them
468104 but michigan ended up prevailing its just michigan what can i say its the most winning program in the country and its best fit for me i came to the decision after talking to some players that came from texas and seeing what they thought about the offensive stats from west virginia because rich rodriguez came from there then it was just looking at the program
468105 is not to try to break up any more fights
468106 i was very polite to the officer i did everything he asked me to and i acted like a man its a bad situation and im sorry that it happened
468107 i think that over time he will continue to demonstrate that to all his fans in both michigan and colorado
468108 hes got a great feel for the game bright we had him up here on a visit hes a special guy he really is hes a special person

468113 lecharles came back to cleveland to be in integral part of the cleveland browns his hometown team
468114 through no fault of the browns at all they didnt know if lecharles was going to come back or not and they moved on with their plans
468115 but this is not the same team lecharles signed with they have commitments to other players lecharles is not ready to be an insurance policy at this point
468116 ive learned a lot about that i e making adjustments from the head coaching standpoint always before i was in my own world as an offensive coordinator at minnesota and miami and just dealing with that part
468117 now when you have the overseeing part of everything as your role youve got to step back more and ive done that more this year because of the quality of the assistant coaches that i have doing their jobs i feel much more confident that way
468118 well i guess we have to talk about the rams because they are in the nfl
468119 someday were gonna be back on top so until then nothing anyone says will hurt me

468124 hows it feel to be the ones being called dirty
468125 you guys would have gone to the super bowl without the injuries talk
468126 the making of a quarterback the incredible rise of eli manning and the new york giants
468127 talking to other guys throughout the league a lot of them said you guys played a hell of a game a hell of a game so the other 16 games in the regular season and the three playoff games really didnt do anything for us you hear that amongst players we played a good game at the right time your quarterback got hot at the right time your defense started playing ball at the right time all those things are being said and heard and that is fine and dandy we have to do it again and the only thing we are shooting for is to win our division and get to the playoffs
468128 we are not even picked to win our division so there is nothing that has changed the only thing that we have is the title of having the super bowl championship of being the most recent super bowl champion we are still the underdogs and i think going into it we will probably be underdogs even at home again
468129 i dont think there is any reason not to i mean why not it is better when you shock the world instead of having all that expectation but obviously we put that on ourselves by winning the super bowl i think this team is mature enough and capable enough to understand the challenges that we are going to face this year
468130 people know where i live or find out where i am living and are sending fan mail there when i fly some pilots are actually getting out of the cockpit to come back and congratulate me it has been a very interesting offseason as far as all the congratulations and where they are coming from
468131 i guess it is a big difference with a week in arizona for the super bowl what that media hype will do for you
468132 every year ive been here ive lined up with a different pair of starting linebackers on the side of me
468133 hopefully we can put two guys there that are going to stay there for a while and we can all get that cohesiveness together among the unit of the three linebackers so we know what each other one does you have to get that feeling you have to get the feeling for kiwanuka and gerris and danny clark and chase blackburn and the younger guys we have we have to grow together and everyone has to understand tendencies once you get that i think we will be alright
468134 i will turn the clock back a year and those two starting outside linebackers when we went into the season had no experience in the system either
468135 one of them had been a defensive end and kawika had come from another team we have some good coaches bill sheridan is a good coach coaching the linebackers and he did a heck of a job getting those guys ready last year and whoever is going to step in this year he will do the same thing we feel confident that way
468136 if something is too good to be true it usually is
468137 its obvious from the way he ran the tests that he has been working and that he was prepared for the tests which was quite a bit different than last fall when we tried to clear him off the physically unable to perform list
468138 so hes made a lot of progress he wants to give it a go and were willing to do that we want to do that for him

468176 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
468177 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter

468390 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
468391 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
468392 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
468393 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
468394 before i continue it should be noted that if my interview with foreman were televised shed be wearing sunglasses and a never before and never again to be worn sweater her face blurred and her voice altered with an electronic box
468395 the brides response was that in chinese culture its acceptable and even expected to give money at weddings
468396 but shes not chinese and neither is her husband though i think one of his co workers might have been
468397 bad bridesmaid bachelorette brawls and taffeta tantrums tales from the front lines
468398 one woman who was asked to be a bridesmaid in her mormon friends wedding found out on the morning of the wedding that she wasnt actually going to be allowed inside the temple because she wasnt mormon
468399 her job as a bridesmaid was to stand on the front steps of the temple in her full bridesmaids outfit and ask those who showed up are you a believer in the church of latter day saints she had to make sure that non mormons including the brides father who had been excommunicated did not get inside
468400 you dont know whos crazier the people who ask or the people who actually go along with it
468401 was not going to be one of those brides that the bridesmaids could wear whatever we wanted that there would be none of that jessica mcclintock bullshit
468402 she sold it like it was normal and it took me a while to realize the bait and switch that had occurred
468403 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
468404 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
468405 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
468406 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
468407 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
468408 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
468409 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
468410 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
468411 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
468412 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
468413 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
468414 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
468415 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
468416 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
468417 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
468418 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
468419 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
468420 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
468421 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
468422 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
468423 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
468424 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
468425 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
468426 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
468427 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
468428 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
468429 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
468430 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
468431 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
468432 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
468433 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
468434 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
468435 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
468436 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
468437 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
468438 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
468439 we have known that women on the combined estrogen pill are at increased risk for cervical cancer she says
468440 what we havent known is what happens after they stop taking the pill now we know that the risk starts to fall pretty quickly and has gone away 10 years later
468441 regular screening is important for all women but especially for those taking oral contraceptives
468442 a woman who has regular screenings can basically forget about the increase in risk
468443 we do not have a rabies vaccine shortage but we are in a supply limitation situation where rabies vaccine supplies are less than ideal
468444 we are not out of the woods yet summer is rabies season but we have breathing room
468445 not all is well but we are in a code yellow situation not code red
468446 you dont need to get that picture with the monkey on your shoulder
468447 and if you are going to be a tourist you need to be attuned to the fact that uncontrolled dog rabies exists around the world
468448 now we have a signal protein that can support the microenvironment for hair development and maybe also for hair renewal
468449 there are a lot of different causes of hair loss further research will test whether any forms of hair loss are influenced by laminin 511
468450 injecting laminin 511 into the skin might under some circumstances promote hair growth
468451 it is not yet known if their residues are harmful to humans
468452 the overall message is that women should not be frightened of the pill
468453 this is a very effective and safe method of contraception especially when combined with regular cervical cancer screening
468454 the variation in increases should be interpreted with caution majid ezzati phd the studys lead researcher says in a news release
468455 we cant tell from our study why this is happening it could be that the states have done a better job in their public health efforts to reduce hypertension or it could be that rates are already so high that they didnt have much higher to go
468456 it is absolutely intriguing this lifestyle change can have as much effect as the most powerful drugs available to us now
468457 we medical oncologists are always looking for drugs that can do this it is delightful to find that diet and lifestyle can have profound effects and work as well as drug therapies with fewer side effects
468458 people say oh it is all in my genes what can i do thats what i call genetic nihilism
468459 this may be an antidote to that genes may be our predisposition but they are not our fate
468460 we can say the longer women take it the longer the protection which lasts 30 years after they stop
468461 this does outweigh any other cancer risk from taking the pill so the net effect is to reduce cancer overall women on the pill do not need to worry they are putting themselves at long term risk of cancer
468462 in breast and cervical cancer there is increased risk but these effects disappear and are not persistent after a woman discontinues oral contraceptives
468463 whereas ovarian cancer protection lasts for decades into the ages when this cancer becomes more common for a woman
468464 this study decides once and for all there is a real protective effect against ovarian cancer that is strong and cuts across all demographic groups
468465 more widespread over the counter access to an agent that can not only prevent cancers but also demonstrably save the lives of tens of thousands of women
468466 people should take the pill for other reasons than cancer prevention
468467 but there is a bonus when they do use the pill for these reasons they will be at reduced risk of cancer
468468 there are harmful effects from oral contraceptives as well as good ones it is a balancing act between risks and benefits
468469 that is why it is a prescription medication women who take oral contraceptives should be monitored and there is advice that goes with prescribing them it is not a simple matter so a doctor has to be part of the equation
468470 until more data becomes available ovary removal during hysterectomy should be approached with great caution
468471 currently the existing evidence does not support the high number of ovary removals in clinical practice
468472 the evidence is mounting that there is no particular advantage to ovary removal for the patient with a low risk for ovarian cancer and there might be a disadvantage
468473 physicians tell patients that their risk of ovarian cancer can be removed by removing the ovaries
468474 what they dont mention is that this may increase their risk for heart disease which is much more common
468475 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
468476 lifting the ban would create new opportunities for american workers and businessmen
468477 but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote
468478 we should know more in a few years when most of these children are between the ages of 3 to 5
468479 while predisposition to asthma may be in part set at birth the factors that may determine this are not strictly genetic
468480 certain substances in the environment that cause allergies such as dust mites can increase a childs chance of developing asthma and the effects may begin before birth
468481 we have to have a multi pronged approach to intervention
468482 if we just reduce allergen levels and the mothers are still experiencing high stress there could still be an immune effect on the child at birth
468483 i want to prepare an entr e on the grill

468496 im not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for
468497 we are not running the internet in china chinese authorities are running the internet in china
468498 if we allow political propaganda its the end of the harmony of the olympic village and the end of the harmony of the games
468499 these are 17 cheats that will not falsify the competition
468500 we want to render justice when all the factors are known

468502 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
468503 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
468504 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
468505 we are talking about extremely low levels this is definitely not nuclear waste
468506 they had discovered the radiation leak weeks ago and did not inform the japanese government immediately
468507 the u s navy s handling of the accident and lack of transparency showed there is no way we can trust them

468509 these are absolute lies its not a question of his opinion against mine these are factual matters these things did not happen im not in the business of suppressing books but the factual inaccuracies should be removed
468510 the events depicted in the pieces i have seen are either completely invented or so distorted so as to add up to invention nobody locked me in a f cupboard what kind of police force would it be to do something like that to the person they are protecting in order to go off to the pub and get drunk

468526 what are you serious all christian churches focus on christ and him crucified they all believe it
468527 how can you be so judgmental you are just being a typical arrogant lutheran assuming you are right and everyone else is wrong
468528 you have a point but if you really believe what you have just said i would as gently and humbly as i can simply say to you you need to get out more and see whats going on in the vast majority of christian churches today
468529 in any and every circumstance i have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger abundance and need i can do all things through him who strengthens me
468530 i have been crucified with christ it is no longer i who live but christ who lives in me and the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself up for me

468535 technically adept and perhaps even challenging to the unseasoned metal listener is clearly the strongest effort to date from new england scene stars the acacia strain
468536 its the acacia strains rationale that makes them somewhat of a standout there isnt an established category called
468537 it could be one of the big extreme releases of the year the guys have streamlined their sound and their lineup creating a solid disc heavy on breakdowns and with no shortage of metal riffs all over the place
468538 think the oppressive groove of mastodon with the stodgy beats of throwdown and the hellish screams of your childhood nightmares this is the sort of noise that makes dogs whimper mountains shudder babies cry and your mates dance all at the same time
468539 you can run so far away ill be waiting for the day
468540 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
468541 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
468542 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
468543 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
468544 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
468545 its all right daddy will take care of you now

468548 these two former correctional officers have now been held accountable in a court of law for their abuse of inmates entrusted to their custody
468549 they do not represent the staff of this department in fact through their actions they have dishonored the 1 500 men and women who perform their jobs with pride professionalism and integrity every day these men and women do a very difficult job and they do it without breaking the law
468550 let me make myself abundantly clear correctional officers work and walk the toughest beat in the state every day seeing things and having to do things that most of us can only imagine and dont want to imagine at that
468551 grossly abused their positions of authority and in the process tarnished their badges
468552 such abuses of authority are an affront not only to the victims in these cases but also to the vast majority of correctional officers who do a very difficult job very well
468553 obviously we are shocked and disappointed that the jury didnt see it the way we saw it inmates have a right to due process but when due process is used as a weapon against the staff thats a problem
468554 its like the buddy cianci rule where you throw a bunch of stuff up on the wall and hope something will stick
468555 they were doing their jobs they were clamping down on inmate drug trafficking they were not popular with the inmates
468556 surely officer ferruccio doesnt believe that our staff are ever allowed to break the law its never acceptable for a sworn peace officer to break the law
468557 i have confidence in the administrators and fine staff at minimum security
468558 im pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadnt been fired from apple it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed it sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick dont lose faith im convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did youve got to find what you love and that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you havent found it yet keep looking dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on so keep looking until you find it dont settle

468560 the point in time when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached after which the rate of production enters terminal decline because the worlds petroleum supply is effectively fixed if global oil consumption is not mitigated before the decline phase begins a world energy crisis may develop because the availability of conventional oil will drop causing prices to rise perhaps dramatically

468624 no israeli soldier has died since august 2004 because of a so called terrorist attack from hamas almost all the casualties in recent months have been inside gaza when israel invaded gaza again the key obstacle to peace in the middle east is israels occupation of land that belongs to other people
468625 zionism was greeted with staunch and passionate opposition by the vast majority of torah leaders at the time of its inception it is sad that so few have actually attempted to speak to the iranian president ahmadinejad or seek the true opinion of iranian jewery who live in peace and practice their faith throughout that nation zionist attempts to socially isolate this man and his people is immoral and disastrous

468649 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
468650 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
468651 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
468652 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
468653 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
468654 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

468674 for nearly two years a young political aide sought to cultivate a farm system for republicans at the justice department hiring scores of prosecutors and immigration judges who espoused conservative priorities and christian lifestyle choices
468675 that aide monica m goodling exercised what amounted to veto power over a wide range of critical jobs asking candidates for their views on abortion and same sex marriage and maneuvering around senior officials who outranked her including the departments second in command the report concluded yesterday that goodling and others had broken civil service laws run afoul of department policy and engaged in misconduct a finding that could expose them to further scrutiny and sanctions
468676 nor is it the work of a few bad individuals
468677 the conservatism that speaks to us through its actions in washington is institutionally opposed to those baseline good intentions we learned about in elementary school its leaders laugh off the idea of the public interest as airy fairy nonsense they caution against bringing top notch talent into government service they declare war on public workers they have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing they have wrecked established federal operations because they disagree with them and they have deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job repairing it will require years of political action
468678 we are a free and sovereign people we govern ourselves and the government is ours but that is the point we are responsible not our leaders since we follow them we let them divert our loyalty from the united states to some party we let them boss the party and turn our municipal democracies into autocracies and our republican nation into a plutocracy we cheat our government and we let our leaders loot it and we let them wheedle and bribe our sovereignty from us
468679 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god

468683 it became popular in schools because one or two teachers loved the sport and worked their butts off to make it happen one day the state and national associations will work out how much they owe to a select group of teachers

468685 its sport where youre asking kids to play the ball with the softest part of their body no the second softest part
468686 art is about seeing look at the art in the world about you its not just in pretty pictures its not just about representing soppy family portraits and their pets its not just about glorifying the politicians and elite of the day its not just about painting a souvenir landscape of your favorite holiday place not recording the pompous acquisition of your grand and expensive house
468687 and in this specific horrendous challenging example of a urinal on a pedestal im saying here is an everyday item you use in your home
468688 that poor bloke sculptor made a beautiful functional form and you the viewer are so shocked that we can look at this as an aesthetic object that you shy your eyes away you twitter and chide that is is not art that it is immoral that it is outrageous that it is improper and all that good bourgeois thinking prevents you from seeing form and function a sculpture well im putting it under your too prudish nose and declaring it so so there
468689 see this stuff is interesting too it has design it has aesthetic properties look see understand that everything we use has the ability to contain those aesthetic properties of form and shape
468690 this is it im stopping here its fine as it is i dont want to spoil what ive done and i dont want to add anything to it
468691 is this at last the locus dei there are enough cathedrals and altars here for a hindu pantheon of divinities each time i look up one of the secretive little side canyons i half expect to see not only the cottonwood tree rising over its tiny spring the leafy god the deserts liquid eye but also a r ainbow colored corona of blazing light pure spirit pure being pure diesmbodied intelligence if a mans imagination were not so weak so easily tired if his capacity for wonder not so limited he would abandon forever such fantasies of the supernal he would learn to perceive in water leaves and silence more than sufficient of the absolute and marvelous more than enough to console him for the loss of the ancient dreams
468692 for more than a decade they have kept the public misinformed about the most important development in tv since the first commercial broadcast in 1941
468693 why wasnt the citizenry given an opportunity to decide how they would like to use the new channels
468694 yet the biggest problem with the transition to digital television in the united states is that the federal communications commission under the bush administration has locked the public out of the process of determining what those benefits might be whats more yesteryears republican controlled congress set the rules regarding this transition thus the public interest obligations of digital broadcasters remain undefined and insufficient money has been set aside for the digital conversion both problems need to be addressed by congress this year
468695 has yet to reopen the proceeding begun in 1999 to define the public interest obligations of digital broadcasters
468696 there is no shortage of swindlers willing to capitalize on the confusion and fears that could surround the dtv transition

468706 if political factors were to block the development of new oil fields in the middle east the ramifications for world oil markets could be quite severe
468707 faces a steep decline rate in its domestic oil fields
468708 the resulting tight markets have increased u s and global vulnerability to disruption and provided adversaries undue potential influence over the price of oil iraq has become a key swing producer posing a difficult situation for the u s government
468709 on and off when it has felt such action was in its strategic interest
468710 stir up anti american sentiment inside and outside the middle east
468711 the united states should conduct an immediate policy review toward iraq including military energy economic and political diplomatic assessments
468712 interagency process to articulate and promote energy security policy with overall economic environmental and foreign policy
468713 the bush administration has moved rapidly in this direction through the creation of the white house energy policy development group headed by vice president dick cheney
468714 in a position to dictate the future of worldwide energy policy and would have a stranglehold on our economy and on that of most of the other nations of the world as well
468715 a u s led ouster of iraqi president saddam hussein could open a bonanza for u s oil companies long banished from iraq scuttling oil deals between baghdad and russia france and other countries and reshuffling world petroleum markets according to industry officials and the iraqi opposition
468716 an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united states
468717 any judicial process is prohibited and shall be deemed null and void
468718 cancels the concept of corporate accountability and abandons the rule of law

468722 legions of critics are condemning one of the successful steps taken to prevent another 9 11 the aggressive interrogation of captured terrorists
468723 it was always hard to sustain the argument that if the united states withdrew from vietnam there would be immense geopolitical consequences
468724 severe beatings in one observed incident a soldier reportedly broke a detainees leg with a baseball bat blows and kicks to the face chest abdomen and extremities and repeated kicks to various parts of the detainees body the application of chemical substances to exposed skin and eyes forced stress positions sometimes to the point of unconsciousness sleep deprivation subjecting detainees to extremes of hot and cold the stacking of detainees into human pyramids and the withholding of food beyond crackers and water
468725 an area of what i will call professional interrogation techniques
468726 to prevail in this war we need more than victories on the battlefield
468727 the record suggests that the administration will neither hold any senior official accountable nor change the policies that have produced this shameful record congress too has abdicated its responsibility for now the appalling truth is that there has been no remedy for the documented torture and killing of foreign prisoners by this american government
468728 it is a terrible inexorable law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing ones own

468822 i have never felt self congratulatory in any way about my involvement because it did precipitate a conflict which eventually claimed 3 500 lives and that is inescapable
468823 it would be very cruel to say that what we have ended up with is a twilight home in east belfast for retired gunmen but are relations today between the communities really that different
468824 im just not convinced that the outcome we do have is any better than what we wouldve had had the march not went ahead
468825 the thought that this would lead to a re emergence of militant irish nationalism which would in turn bring about the resurgence of militant loyalism would simply never even have occurred to us
468826 what this was about and what it has returned to was equality of citizenship history will record the provisional iras campaign as a continuation of the civil rights movement by inappropriate means

468856 iits have enjoyed the three basic freedoms of an educational institution freedom to choose whom to teach who will teach and what to teach the iits also enjoy full cost budgetary support the iits remain successful so long as these amenities continue
468857 in the past few years iits have been ranked as the top educational institutions in india and asia by national and international magazines however the only objective ranking of top 500 universities worldwide by research output has been done by professor nian cai liu and his colleagues at the shanghai jiao tong university in china in this list the only institutions to make it from india are the iits and the indian institute of science bangalore this is indeed a matter of great pride
468858 the government should resolve the problem immediately as the whole jammu is burning today people are dying but the government will also feel the heat of it we want the land back
468859 the government is misleading entire country the sentiments of the people hindus are constantly being hurt we will not tolerate this
468860 we were stopped at the airport in jammu and kashmir and were compelled to go back i think its a breach of our democratic rights administration has responsibility to manage traditional affairs in a proper way resorting to repressive policies will further escalate already worsening condition
468861 i find it very laudable that so many people are getting together and in a very short span of 101 hours are making a film that makes impact they may have had nothing to do with that ngo and with which they have no familiarity prior to being allotted this ngo i think it is very laudable effort and i can only envision a better and a brighter future for this i think more and more of such efforts need to be made
468862 but the eunuchs on whom she made a film some time back told us a very simple thing that despite numerous filmmakers making films on them they were still living in the pathetic conditions what we understood out of their statement was that every film should have a social message to be effective so our responsibility as a filmmaker was not just to make a film and win the competition but to make a good film

468865 they have a huge potential to build more hydropower plants they have also quite a bad record because many of these dams were constructed without a lot of involvement of civil society there were some big failures especially in the field of irrigation
468866 the zambezi is an interesting case because it involves several countries it has several large dam structures and we found partners who were interested in working with us it is a huge area almost as large as switzerland
468867 there is now a quest for so called integrated river management in which not only the different scientific disciplines work together but they also work with communities stakeholders companies and the public and private sector
468868 when we came there we realised there had to be a follow up because many of these initiatives have a time frame people pull out and then the whole effort collapses and there is not enough capacity at the local level to continue

468895 i do not have to give the reasons behind my decision
468896 the law has to be applied to all equally but some always find a window of escape
468897 the sure thing is that president christofias does not give out the message of the just and fair society that he was promising before the presidential elections
468898 without knowing all the details i am against granting any form of clemency because no one is above the law
468899 as a matter of principle all people are equal before the law
468900 if it is judged that someone should be granted clemency the reasons behind this form of pardon should be known so it does not upset the citizens because they have a right to know
468901 i am sure that if the president granted his pardon it is for important reasons
468902 i will not judge president christofias decision for pardoning the young lawyer but i would like to point out that some people in society such as lawyers mps and doctors have to be an example of upholding the law and of proper social behaviour
468903 i do not personally know the circumstances under which the pardon was granted or the reasons as to why it was suggested but if it was granted under no significant grounds it is unjustifiable and no one can be above the law everyone should be equal before the law and since no explanations were given each citizen has the right to believe that because of her profession as lawyer that makes her more equal to the law
468904 we actually got approached about doing it by multiple people it was one of those things where we were like wow lets totally do it i think its sort of a fun way to show the other side of

469119 nada es eso comparado con lo que te contar la noche pr xima si vivo a n y el rey quiere con servarme
469120 por alah no la matar hasta que le haya o do la continuaci n de su relato que es asombroso
469121 con toda la generosidad y simpat a de mi cora z n
469122 concedo el resto de la sangre por que hab a de redimirse el cr men y dejo en libertad al merca der
469123 pero a adi schahrazada es m s asombrosa la historia del pes cador
469124 todo el poder y la fuerza est n en alah el alt si mo y el omnipotente

469130 oh gigante audaz y rebel de t te atreves a decir que solei m n es el profeta de alah soleim n muri hace mil ochocientos a os y nosotros estamos al fin de los tiempos pero qu historia vienes a contarme cu l es el motivo de que estuvieras en este jarr n
469131 no hay m s dios que alah pero permite oh pescador que te anuncie una buena noticia
469132 tu muerte vas a morir ahora mismo y de la manera m s terrible
469133 oh jefe de los efrits mere ces por esa noticia que el cielo te retire su ayuda pueda l alejarte de nosotros pero por qu deseas mi muerte qu hice para mere cerla te he sacado de esa vasija te he salvado de una larga perma nencia en el mar y te he tra do a la tierra
469134 piensa y elige la especie de muerte que prefieras morir s del modo que gustes
469135 cu l es mi crimen para merecer tal cas tigo
469136 habla y abrevia tu relato porque de impaciente que se halla mi alma se me est saliendo por el pie
469137 descubrir y dar los tesoros de la tierra a quien me liberte
469138 ahora matar a quien me libre pero le dejar antes elegir conce di ndole la clase de muerte que prefiera
469139 oh jeique de los efrits as es como devuelves el mal por el bien a fe que no miente el proverbio
469140 ya hemos hablado bastante sabe que sin remedio te he de matar
469141 yo no soy mas que un hombre y l un efrit pero alah me ha dado una raz n bien despierta acudir a una astucia para perderlo ver hasta d nde llega su malicia
469142 por el nombre del alt simo que est grabado en el sello de soleim n te conjuro a que respondas con verdad a pregunta
469143 c mo has podido entrar por entero en este jarr n donde apenas cabe tu pie o tu mano
469144 efectivamente no lo creer jam s mientras no vea con mis propios ojos que te metes en l
469145 elige y piensa la clase de muerte que m s te con venga si te echar al mar y me har una casa junto a la orilla e impedir a todo el mundo que pes que diciendo
469146 echarte al mar que si has estado en l mil ochocientos a os no sal dr s esta vez hasta el d a del juicio no te rogu yo que me dejaras la vida para que alah te la conservase a ti y no me mataras para que alah te matase obrando infamemente rechazaste mi plegaria por eso alah te ha puesto en mis manos y no me remuerde el haberte enga ado
469147 he averiguado la enfer medad que atormenta tu cuerpo y he sabido que un gran n mero de m dicos no ha podido encontrar el medio de curarla voy oh rey a aplicarte mi tratamiento sin hacer te beber medicinas ni untarte con pomadas
469148 por alah que si me curas te enrique cer hasta los hijos de tus hijos te conceder todos tus deseos y ser s mi compa ero y amigo
469149 es cierto que me curar s de esta enfermedad pondi el otro
469150 oh gran m dico qu d a y que momento ver n realizarse lo que acabas de prome ter apres rate a hacerlo hijo m o
469151 emp alo de este modo y da con toda tu fuerza en la pelota y haz de modo que llegues a sudar de ese modo el remedio penetrar en la palma de mano y circular por todo tu cuerpo cuando transpires y el remedio haya tenido tiempo de obrar regresa a tu palacio ve en seguida a ba arte al hamman y quedar s curado ahora la paz sea contigo
469152 me ha curado por el exterior de mi cuerpo sin untarme con pomadas oh alah qu ciencia tan fuerza es colmar de beneficios a este hombre y tenerle para siem pre como compa ero y amigo afec tuoso
469153 el envidioso ataca a todo el mundo en el coraz n del envidioso est emboscada la perse cuci n y la desarrolla si dispone de fuerza o la conserva latente la debilidad
469154 oh rey del siglo y del tiempo que envuelves a los hombres en tus beneficios tengo para ti un consejo de gran impor tancia que no podr a ocultarte sin ser un mal hijo si me mandas que te lo revele yo te lo revelar
469155 quien no mire el fin y las consecuencias no tendr a la fortu na por amiga
469156 qui n es el que supones enemigo m o y colma do por m de favores
469157 oh rey si est s dor mido despierta porque aludo al m dico ruy n
469158 ese es buen amigo m o y para m el m s querido de los hombres pues me ha curado con una cosa que yo he tenido en la mano y me ha librado de mi enfermedad que hab a desesperado a los m dicos cierta mente que no hay otro como l en este siglo en el mundo entero lo mismo en occidente que en orien te c mo te atreves a hablarme as de l desde ahora le voy a se alar un sueldo de mil dinares al mes y aunque le diera la mitad de mi reino poco seria para lo que merece creo que me dices todo eso por envidia como se cuenta en la historia que he sabido del rey sindabad
469159 ah hermana m a cu n dulces cu n puras cu n deliciosas son tus pala bras
469160 qu es eso comparado con lo que os contar la pr xima si vivo todav a y el rey tiene a bien con servarme
469161 oh de los siglos lleg la poca de ir de caza
469162 dicen que has jurado matar a aquel por cuya proximidad pasase la gacela
469163 por mi vida hay que perseguir y alcanzar a esa gacela
469164 soy la hija de un rey de reyes de la india iba con la caravana por el desierto sent ganas de dormir y me ca de la cabalgadura sin darme cuenta entonces me encontr sola y abandonada
469165 entonces por qu no das alg n dinero a tu enemigo para satisfa cerle
469166 no se satisface con dinero s lo se conten ta con el alma por eso tengo miedo como v ctima de una injusticia
469167 si te persiguen como afirmas pide contra tu ene migo la ayuda de alah y l te librar de sus maleficios y de los maleficios de aquellos de quienes tienes miedo
469168 oh t que atiendes al oprimido que te implora hazme triunfar de mi enemigo al jale de m pues tienes poder para cuanto deseas
469169 dices la ver dad h gase seg n tu opini n oh visir bien aconsejado porque es muy probable que ese m dico haya venido ocultamente como un esp a para ser mi perdici n si me ha curado con una cosa que he tenido en la mano muy bien podr a per derme con otra que por ejemplo me diera a oler
469170 haya que mandar inmediatamente que le traigan y cuando se presente aqu degollarlo y as te librar s de sus maleficios y quedar s desahogado y tranquilo hazle traici n antes que l te la haga a ti
469171 sabes por qu te he hecho venir a mi presen cia
469172 te he mandado llamar pata matarte y arrancarte el alma
469173 oh rey por qu me has de matar que falta he cometido
469174 dicen que eres un esp a y que viniste para matarme por eso te voy a matar antes de que me mates
469175 corta la cabeza a ese traidor y l branos de sus maleficios
469176 cons rvame la vida y alah te la conservar no me mates si no alah te matar tambi n
469177 no podr vivir confia do ni estar tranquilo como no te mate porque si me has curado con una cosa que tuve en la mano creo que me matar s con otra cosa que me des a oler o de cualquier otro modo
469178 oh rey esta es tu recompensa as devuel ves mal por bien
469179 no hay m s remedio que darte la muerte sin demora
469180 cons rvame la vida y alah te la conservar no me mates o al h te matar a ti
469181 esta es tu recompensa he aqu que me tratas como hizo un cocodrilo
469182 oh se or no es posible contarla en este estado por alah sobre ti cons rvame la vida y alah te la conservar
469183 oh rey conc denos la sangre de este m dico pues nunca le hemos visto obrar en contra tuya al contrario le vimos librarte de aquella enfermedad que hab a resis tido a los m dicos y a los sabios
469184 ignor is la causa de que mate a este m dico si lo dejo con vida mi perdici n es segura porque si me cur de la enfermedad con una cosa que tuve en la mano muy bien podr a ma tarme d ndome a oler cualquier otra tengo mucho miedo de que me asesine para cobrar el precio de mi muerte pues debe ser un esp a que ha venido a matarme su muerte es necesaria s lo as podr perder mis temores
469185 cons rvame la vida para que alah te conserve y no me mates para que no te mate alah
469186 oh rey si mi muerte es realmente necesaria d jame ir a mi casa para despachar mis asuntos encargar a mis parien tes y vecinos que cuiden de ente rrarme y sobre todo para regalar mis libros de medicina a fe que tengo un libro que es verdadera mente el extracto de los extractos y la rareza de las rarezas que quiero legarte como un obsequio para que lo conserves cuidadosa mente en tu armario
469187 contiene cosas inestimables el me nor de los secretos que revela es el siguiente cu ndo me corten la cabeza abre el libro cuenta tres hojas y vu lvelas lee en seguida tres renglones de la p gina de la izquierda y entonces la cabeza cor tada te hablar y contestar a todas las preguntas que le dirijas
469188 s en verdad oh rey es efectivamente una cosa prodigiosa
469189 oh rey coge ese libro pero no lo abras antes de cortarme la cabeza cuando la hayas cortado col cala en la bandeja y manda que la aprieten bien contra los pol vos para resta ar la sangre des pu s abrir s el libro
469190 nada es eso comparado con lo que os con tar la noche pr xima si vivo toda v a y el rey tiene a bien conservar me

469209 es muy importante que un amante sepa despedirse para empezar no se deber a levantar con apresuraci n sino aguardar a que se le insista un poco anda ya hay luz no te gustar a que te sorprendieran aqu tampoco deber a ponerse los pantalones de un golpe como si tuviera mucha prisa y sin antes acercarse a su compa era para murmurar en su o do lo que s lo ha ducho a medias durante la noche
469210 me gusta pensar en un soltero su nimo aventurero le ha hecho escoger este estado al regresar a su casa despu s de una incursi n amorosa es el alba y tiene un poco de sue o pero apenas llega se acerca a su escritorio y se pone a escribir una carta de amor no escribiendo lo primero que se le ocurre sino entregado a su tarea y trazando con gusto hermosos caracteres luego de enviar su misiva con un paje aguarda la respuesta mientras murmura ese o aquel pasaje de las escrituras budistas m s tarde lee algunos poemas chinos y espera a que est listo el ba o vestido con su manto de corte quiz escarlata y que lleva como una bata de casa toma el sexto cap tulo de la escritura del loto y lo lee en silencio precisamente en el momento m s solemne y devoto de su lectura religiosa regresa el mensajero con la respuesta con asombrosa si blasfema rapidez el amante salta del libro a la carta

469269 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
469270 thats such a shame especially for the ones who were clean and its most important for the athletes who were second
469271 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it

469321 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001

469326 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
469327 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open

469378 we have prepared three sketches of suspects based on description given by an eye witness who saw them planting the bombs in different parts of the city
469379 we have decided to not make those sketches public at this stage as it will hamper the probe

469381 ostentando un cargo de elecci n popular decidi traicionar la confianza e inter s colectivo a cambio de d divas mezquindades envilecedoras de los halagos y las promesas burocr ticas
469382 los anuncios hechos por el ministro en el sentido de reestructurar la empresa y reorganizar los modelos de gesti n intentan responder a la grave crisis que desde hace tiempo venimos denunciando los dirigentes sindicales clasistas y revolucionarios en la industria petrolera
469383 no es cierto que ahora pdvsa sea del pueblo como lo afirma el ministro todo lo contrario las puertas de pdvsa cada vez se cierran m s para el pueblo buena prueba de ello es que hace tiempo que la administraci n de pdvsa se olvid de los h roes populares que contribuyeron al rescate de la industria que los condecoraron y les pro metieron vinculaci n y seis a os despu s esos compa eros siguen desempleados a la espera de una oportunidad
469384 tampoco es cierto que fue la administraci n de pdvsa quien confront las mafias sindicaleras que controlaban el ingreso a la industria fuimos los dirigentes clasistas y revolucionarios que tuvimos la entereza moral y pol tica para decir que la vieja cl usula 69 del contrato petrolero que en su momento hab a sido una conquista de los trabajadores desgraciadamente en manos de la burocracia sindical se hab a convertido en una perversi n raz n por la cual propusimos un sistema democr tico para definir los ingresos sin embargo el sisdem en manos de la empresa ahora es un sistema igual de pernicioso que la vieja cl usula 69 y por eso luchamos por ejercer la contralor a obrera y popular
469385 es un hecho que las relaciones obrero patronales en pdvsa han llegado a situaciones extremas por el rol desp tico de gerentes y la alta n mina de la empresa que desoye a los trabajadores la m xima expresi n fue el fraude de negociaci n del contrato petrolero el a o pasado cuando empresa y el mal recordado ministro del trabajo jos ram n rivero impusieron una comisi n entregadora del contrato petrolero y nos impusieron la miseria de un aumento de 12 bol vares fuertes esa pol tica perversa a n se mantiene y por ello es que en oriente hemos tenido que luchar tenazmente para que se escuchen los reclamos de los trabajadores y hemos impuesto que se constituyan mesas de trabajo estas mesas de trabajo no son un invento del ministro son un logro de los trabajadores para hacerse escuchar que no venga ahora a decir que ese es el nuevo modelo porque lo que se quiere es desconocer a las organizaciones sindicales a sus dirigentes leg timos para dar paso a compadrazgos y prebendas por eso m s que nunca vamos a acompa ar a los trabajadores a estas mesas de trabajo para impedir el tr fico de influencias ojala que los funcionarios que designe el ministro ram rez tengan suficiente tiempo y capacidad de decisi n para escuchar atender y resolver todos los reclamos de los trabajadores que son muchos
469386 el poder se concentra en una c pula de 7 personas que tendr n la capacidad para resolverlo todo esa s per comisi n central tiene plena potestad para modificar la normativa interna en tiempo record de seis meses y sin contar con la participaci n de nadie hay una concentraci n de poderes y se consolida el proceso de re burocratizaci n a tal punto que ahora la empresa es quien orienta a los trabajadores sobre como participar en las elecciones sindicales llama a los dirigentes sindicales de bolsillo para que se comprometan con la modificaci n de la normativa interna le da a entender que ahora los trabajadores no necesitan los sindicatos porque las santas mesas de trabajo son la soluci n a todos los problemas etc
469387 a principios del 2003 los petroleros junto con las comunidades recuperamos la industria logramos la cogesti n en la industria y en muchos casos impusimos el control obrero
469388 seguiremos luchando y denunciando y sobre todo queremos que nos escuchen bien porque no se trata de reemplazar una meritocracia por una tecnoburocracia los dirigentes sindicales clasistas que no nos doblegamos que defendemos consecuentemente los derechos de los trabajadores

469407 in january and february while barack obama and hillary clinton were in the early stages of the battle for the democratic presidential nomination the number of americans who considered themselves to be democrats surged to record highs
469408 maybe that is conclusive proof that pumas were democrats after all
469409 it takes things that are very standard and usual and things that kids see all the time in saratoga and makes them accessible to kids by putting it at their speed their size they get to see exactly what if feels like to stand next to a tire
469410 the liberty interest announced in lawrence protects only adult consensual private conduct
469411 the statute in reliable does not prohibit sexual conduct private or otherwise nor does it impermissibly burden any personal right it prohibits only commercial conduct e g manufacturing selling or advertising sexual devices including dildos and artificial vaginas which the people of texas acting through their elected representatives have deemed to be particularly immoral offensive or otherwise warranting commercial prohibition
469412 its final in the 11th circuit and the supreme court did not want to hear that case
469413 now its final here while you can almost be sure justices scalia roberts thomas and alito all are going to disagree with this decision for tactical reasons one or more may not want to hear this issue just yet
469414 i think one argument for those opposing certiorari would be that this is not an important case precisely because it has been resolved in the two circuits that cover all the states that have such a law if this case it taken however it will be to test the limits of lawrence but there will surely be other cases that test the limits that are going to have far more compelling social arguments one way or the other
469415 todays decision reaffirms the position we have taken and argued since the early 1980s though i must admit that if someone had said even in 2003 that we would be able to sell these ideas so quickly i wouldnt have believed them
469416 the significance in the lawrence decision was the liberty interest of the participants consensual activity of a sexual activity that was not for procreation because the only rationale to say that two guys couldnt do it is the judeo christian philosophy that sex is only to procreate thats why they believe you cant use contraceptives and why two guys cant engage in sex and also why you cant masturbate
469417 im optimistic and believe the day is coming when the world is going to realize that it is not immoral to jack off and to be honest with you these arguments are unrelated to free expression the free expression concept after you take lawrence to the next step and then reliable to the next step is that if i have the right to eroticize myself with a device my hand or anything else i like i certainly ought to be able to eroticize myself by watching a movie
469418 now a circuit court has adopted the decision and even went further in outwardly saying there is a privacy issue and liberty interest in being able to eroticize yourself
469419 the mot juste is of public utility we are governed by words the laws are graven in words and literature is the sole means of keeping these words living and accurate

469421 obviously we are not dealing with people that can act so they cant act the pain therefore the pain is very real
469422 there were three loud bangs and i woke my partner jed up and we thought that maybe it was the power box exploding
469423 we got up to check the power box there was no light out there it was really dark but my partner saw someone slumped against our fence and he told me to go and grab a torch and the phone to ring the police
469424 initially the man was still alive and i told my partner to give him cpr but then he saw the shotgun and the policeman on the phone said to stay away
469425 we didnt realise there was another person who was already dead it was so dark but then one of the police lights shone over her and we saw there was a lady lying on the ground covered in blood
469426 i cant believe two people died outside our front yard its just terrible
469427 they must have had an argument and gotten out of the car i didnt hear any arguing or yelling just the three shotgun blasts
469428 it was really loud and it was two bangs quick after each other bang bang and then a few seconds later another shot
469429 i found some dried flowers and i put them out there in case the families want to come and grieve i dont know what to do im in shock
469430 tanas coaching toulon and he was passing through melbourne on his way home
469431 tana was up front with me he said ive spoken sonnys management group and he made sure to keep me in the loop of what was going on
469432 i was certainly aware of his interest in sonny and he was here doing the sly
469433 i made tana aware of what the plans were for sonny not only for the world cup but also our game in new zealand
469434 but who am i to step in and interfere what i can tell you is tana did tell me that he and sonny had been communicating
469435 i havent talked to him since he left australia for france but i know it doesnt look good for me when ive been mentoring the guy and hes pissed off overseas
469436 if sonny hadnt been in a position he was in im not too sure he would have made that move to toulon
469437 had a few other areas in his life been more settled we probably wouldnt be talking today about it
469438 i could sense his frustration with a few things when we talked
469439 it would have been very hard for me to comment or advise him because ive never been in the position he has been in
469440 as a friend those issues are between him and i and thats how they should stay
469441 its not the ideal and i do feel for the bulldogs and the players at the club but unless you know the whole situation its hard to pass judgement
469442 im not saying what he did was the right thing to do but he is a young guy at 22 and we have to look at exactly why he made this decision
469443 i think he was dealing with a lot of issues and i dont think his situation is over
469444 pacific sun will stay in auckland until at least the morning to provide passengers with a more comfortable voyage following a further deterioration in the weather
469445 its been a nightmare since wednesday today is my sons 14th birthday and we were supposed to be on the sea but now we are having his birthday on a ship in auckland harbour
469446 we tried to go on the cruise ship in 2007 but they totally cancelled that one because the ship was previously damaged so this is our second one and we still havent got away yet
469447 i developed my music in the us because i had the chance to work with people over there but i always wanted to come back here and release it in new zealand i grew up here and i have family and friends here
469448 it was a direction i was seriously considering but eventually i realised it wasnt what i was looking for
469449 i felt like i had something i wanted to say and music i wanted to get out there and i thought i had to pursue it and give it a shot
469450 i wanted to change to something that was easier to remember easy for an audience to know
469451 when hamish carter came up with the idea we were thrilled its such a perfect name for the new zealand village chill out zone
469452 it just shows that in new zealand everyone feels like bros and thats really nice it isnt about being brown its about being a new zealander
469453 one of the lines from brotown is asians are cool so its really cool to be there in beijing
469454 i am very excited to have a new zealand creative success story helping to inspire our team in beijing i have no doubt that our team will relate to and enjoy hanging out in brotown
469455 i was always a protective mum but now i cant let my daughter walk down a different aisle when we are shopping and i have panic attacks
469456 im glad hes not in napier but hes a ticking time bomb and should be locked up
469457 the system failed me and my daughter they not only let me down they put my daughter at risk which is unacceptable
469458 he was supposed to be under 24 hour supervision and was to have two trackers if he left the property
469459 yet he was able to jump the fence into my property and stalk my five year old daughter for 10 days
469460 it was only because i am a protective mum anyway that i found out who he was before something happened
469461 when i did find out who he was and what he had done i hit the roof
469462 my father has been very supportive and has been present at all my court appearances
469463 i am aware police have raised a concern that i was convicted of assaulting chris when he was aged 15 that incident was seven years ago and i have had a close relationship with my son since
469464 anyone with a violent history needed to be looked at carefully
469465 a chief ingredient for a healthy start in life is a continuous loving relationship with one mother figure nature has arranged this through the oneness of breastfeeding contrary to the popular opinion that you should avoid spoiling a baby we are now being told that you cant give the baby too much love love him enjoy him fulfill his needs and respond to his smiles cries and discomforts nature helps babies to receive this constant individualized attention through the breastfeeding relationship
469466 this is the reason why except where it is quite impossible it is more desirable that the mother should feed her child at her own breast who shall say what mysterious influences are exerted upon the growth of that little creature by the mother upon whom it depends entirely for its development
469467 in may 1995 pope john paul ii encouraged breastfeeding in comments to the pontifical academy of sciences
469468 two major benefits to the child protection against disease and proper nourishment
469469 in addition to these immunological and nutritional effects this natural way of feeding can create a bond of love and security between mother and child and enable the child to assert its presence as a person through interaction with the mother
469470 all of this is obviously a matter of immediate concern to countless women and children and something which clearly has general importance for every society rich or poor one hopes that your studies will serve to heighten public awareness of how much this natural activity benefits the child and helps to create the closeness and maternal bonding so necessary for healthy child development so human and natural is this bond that the psalms use the image of the infant at its mothers breast as a picture of gods care for man cf ps 22 9 so vital is this interaction between mother and child that my predecessor pope pius xii urged catholic mothers if at all possible to nourish their children themselves cf allocution to mothers 26 october 1941 from various perspectives therefore the theme is of interest to the church called as she is to concern herself with the sanctity of life and of the family
469471 je pense que le club fait des efforts importants pour trouver une solution dans cette affaire et il faut attendre pour voir ce qui va se passer

469473 when they moved it to friday night the writing was on the wall
469474 its been going for 10 years so it closure was always in the pipeline
469475 i dont know if we are commissioning any more or not
469476 its been interesting you sit in new zealand looking at the northern hemisphere and think theyre different in the way they play and their competitions arent as good as ours
469477 but then you actually come up here and realise the six nations is a tremendous competition
469478 some of the rugbys not great but everything that goes with it is enjoyable as a punter
469479 and thats what i am ive turned into the most amazing fan
469480 i remember lying on the floor of the living room watching games from wales on a black and white tv
469481 my hero growing up was gareth edwards when the lions toured new zealand in 1971 every boy in new zealand started kicking the ball around the corner because thats what barry john did
469482 just ask grant fox one of our greatest no 10s everybody wanted to be barry john
469483 educating the girls out here was an opportunity to broaden their horizons
469484 were from the most beautiful country but weve become very tunnel visioned in terms of the greater world the world wars all those things we participated in as new zealanders
469485 the generation growing up now i believe doesnt really see the significance of that
469486 being here in europe and being able to take the girls to gallipoli flanders field and those sort of places makes them realise what new zealand went through
469487 in world war one we lost 10 percent of our male population which was extraordinary its really important to me the children learn things like that
469488 wales have done really well same players different attitude thats the key thing
469489 i remember shane williams saying after two weeks training under gatland hed never trained so intensely
469490 i found that bizarre hed been in the welsh team for five or six years and hed never trained as intensely as that why
469491 i think they could still be fitter but their body shapes are changing i know that warren is big on that and hes instilling a belief in them
469492 at the end of the day theyll be the same size and strength as the next team but theyll also have the attitude if youve got that belief about winning nine times out of 10 you can beat anyone
469493 warren likes winning and if you talk about winning all the time it helps
469494 because my older brother wouldnt allow anyone but him to wear the all black shirt
469495 i remember when i was playing two weeks before a test match id be in the pub having a beer and someone would tap me on the shoulder and say fitzy time to go home
469496 id never met this guy but here was a complete stranger telling me to go home and start preparing for the test
469497 as all blacks we celebrate success but we park it very quickly
469498 we won the world cup in 1987 but weve never had a reunion as a team yet the english still talk about 1966 i think its a good thing to park success
469499 what really gets to you is your defeats you remember those more than your wins
469500 unfortunately for dad who passed away a couple of years ago he lost to the welsh in 1953 which of course was the last time the all blacks lost to wales he never got over it
469501 cliff morgan would ring him every year and invite him back to wales for the reunion of the 1953 team and he never went once
469502 even in 1989 when we toured ireland and wales mum had to go by herself because dad wouldnt go back to wales which shows how we park our success and remember our losses
469503 average kiwis who have had enough of this system always letting them down
469504 the country is at a tipping point and people are ready for change
469505 we as a trust believe we have gone about as far as we can with this labour administration
469506 they havent come out with their policies yet but we cant see much change
469507 the clubhouse allows me to just be creative with my ideas
469508 what i like about the club is that i get to write and record my own songs
469509 the goals of the teen summit are to inspire computer clubhouse youth not only to build hands on fluency in technology but also to become self motivated confident learners through collaborative experiences that spark their interest expand life skills and help them become global citizens
469510 another example of the bungling thats occurred in the department under labour
469511 we are aware of attempts by major pelly to seek compensation from the nzdf through legal processes involving a woman in wanganui
469512 because it is going through legal paths there is not a lot we can say about the matter
469513 i am not going to die at my desk of a heart attack
469514 august 9 i just made my signature file its only 6 pages long sign in before you can post messages
469515 wyatt was diagnosed with wilms tumor which is a form of childhood kidney cancer in february of 2004 on a routine screening they found a spot on his right kidney we knew that there needed to be more research done for wilms tumor because the drugs that we were using were drugs that were developed in the 1960s we attended a meeting for curesearch and within two hours of being in the meeting we knew that there was no funding for childhood cancer we had eight meetings that day and senator colemans office was the last meeting of the day we knew before we left his office that he was going to help us do something about the lack of funding for childhood cancer and then in the months after that senator coleman authored the conquer childhood cancer act senator coleman is a lifeline for every family of a child who has been diagnosed with cancer hes not just my senator hes my friend
469516 the instinctive urge to punch back was tempered by the fact that race is a fire that could singe both candidates
469517 they pull a knife you pull a gun they send one of yours to the hospital you send one of theirs to the morgue
469518 they tell us the economy is growing but whats growing is hunger the food kitchens are always full now because prices are going through the clouds
469519 after argentinas economic crisis in 2001 you wouldnt have seen the economic growth weve experienced if it wasnt for soybeans
469520 this is the biggest blow the farc has suffered in its history
469521 hes not as legendary as sure shot but hes one of the most important chiefs the farc had
469522 more important even than the numbers is the quality of the people who are leaving the farc
469523 we now have fully fledged cadres who have a lot of experience and who have decided that they dont want to spend their lives in the farc they dont think its going anywhere
469524 and i know where he lives do you want to see
469525 in this case agricultural producers have demonstrated great disregard for the community showing an irrationality and irresponsibility that is truly alarming
469526 theres no one left in the house everyone got killed
469527 it is unthinkable that gunmen will break into your house with your family put everyone to sit in a chair and kill them
469528 its no secret for anyone that the farc kidnaps venezuelans
469529 its no secret for anyone that the farc kidnaps venezuelans
469530 i guarantee the farmers and inhabitants of the border that i believe the word of commander marulanda
469531 the farc do not kidnap nor are they going to kidnap in venezuela thats the farcs commitment
469532 in venezuela this is one of the sources of financing for our organization
469533 we look for cattlemen for entrepreneurs for businessmen who have the most money in venezuela
469534 weve been asking for one year for a meeting with the president
469535 they had never shown themselves to be worried about our cases never
469536 as a state we are showing that there is a policy to fight narco trafficking
469537 were not saying its just a problem for colombia and the united states were assuming responsibility thats why were doing this
469538 i think they are trying to respond to those accusations of not making this a high enough priority by demonstrating that they are taking lots of action
469539 as a domestic political issue crime has become very salient and i think the ch vez government sees that as a real challenge and for that reason is also interested
469540 if you want to see what makes a consequential difference you look at whats been going on in colombia real arrests going after traffickers infrastructure really seizing
469541 going after the transnational elements of the trade i have yet to see that kind of transformation on the part of the venezuelans
469542 what were now seeing is a threat to our investment a threat to plan colombia
469543 these ovens are illegal so we have to do it
469544 i have no idea what we are going to do this is how we survive
469545 were doing nothing here but hurting american businesses and american workers why i think the speaker made it very clear this action today is nothing short of political blackmail
469546 this is a process that you know always has two steps forward and one step back we just got to make sure that its only one step back
469547 ten months is a long time may seem short to you but theres plenty of time to get a deal done
469548 president bush told mr medvedev that he looks forward to working with him and that he hopes the two can establish a close working relationship that will help them deal with important world issues
469549 president bush said that he had read with interest mr medvedevs recent remarks on personal freedoms independent media rule of law and fighting corruption
469550 if we fail to approve this agreement we will let down our close ally we will damage our credibility in the region and we will embolden the demagogues in our hemisphere
469551 president uribe told me that the people across the region are watching to see what the united states will do
469552 the two issues are separate the regional diplomatic and military crisis will not be solved by approving the colombia free trade agreement
469553 what the farc has done is just the limit theyve killed people and were tired

469557 depicts gay youth with stories about how intolerance and harassment led them to attempt suicide and how glad they are that those attempts failed because their lives have since changed for the better
469558 it is tragic to know that suicide rates among lgbtq youth are highest during the back to school season
469559 beginning a new school year in high school or college creates stress and difficulties for many young people and struggling with sexual orientation issues can trigger additional challenges
469560 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it

469565 we ought to help countries like peru that are not going the direction of president bush said after the vote that he looked forward to signing the bill that would
469566 our firm support for those who share our values of freedom and democracy
469567 one of the major reasons that the middle class in the united states is shrinking poverty is increasing and the gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider is in fact due to our disastrous unfettered trade policy

469581 i find nothing wrong with them the articles theyre putting in will be better than before
469582 because of my government the human rights of 25 million peruvians were rescued without exceptions
469583 if any detestable acts were committed i condemn them but they were not done on my orders
469584 there was a clear chain of command from fujimori to the executioners
469585 my countrymen we have done and will do all we can to liberate our hostages
469586 if you keep history in mind the response is logical no
469587 when the farc began to say that they were not turning over the hostages supposedly because of military operations when we had done everything possible within our reach to facilitate the hand over we saw that the farc was trying to fool ch vez the international community and us
469588 when we saw that the information coincided well that gives us a certain level of confidence that the hypothesis that they didnt have the boy was true
469589 these almost six years of captivity have shown me that im not as resistant nor as brave nor as intelligent nor as strong as i had thought
469590 i have fought many battles i have tried to escape on several opportunities i have tried to maintain hope as one does keeping head above water but mamita i have been defeated
469591 ingrids letter has awakened the conscience of the entire world
469592 the proofs of life have caused an unprecedented spike in interest about the hostages situation here in washington

469604 we dont think the spears hilton ad is negative at all after all its a well known fact that senator mccain has a special affection for young thin rich blond ladies whatever the intent of the ad im sure he means well
469605 the question we should all be asking is which of the two britney spears or paris hilton would senator mccain like to have an affair with based on is track record im guessing it would be the one with the most money

469637 los viernes son los d as de mercado y es el d a en que todo el mundo est en el pueblo bebiendo o donde las putas
469638 al comienzo me sentaba solo en una tienda con el paso del tiempo de verme tanto la gente empez a conversar conmigo
469639 era una persona a la que le gustaba el trago durante varias semanas le fui haciendo la charla y como no ten a plata para tomar o ir donde la putas yo lo invitaba
469640 un viernes cuando el guerrillero baj est bamos en un bar y l se sent con nosotros ese d a se arm una pelea de borrachos lleg la polic a y nos arrest a todos nos dejaron 24 horas en el calabozo
469641 la primera vez hab a unos 30 guerrilleros a m me dio un susto el berraco y no dejaba de pensar en lo que le hab a pasado a mi capit n guerrero me toc hacer de tripas coraz n y por fortuna el guerrillero me present con sus compa eros como un buen amigo que les ayudaba a l y su familia
469642 ten a las g evas en el cuello ese d a

469644 alquil una casa en el pueblo cerca de donde viv a el due o del cami n sal amos de parranda juntos y and bamos para arriba y para abajo todo el tiempo
469645 aunque hab amos hablado de la guerrilla y yo me hab a mostrado muy af n con su lucha l no me hab a comentado qu parte de los v veres que nosotros ten amos en el almac n era para la guerrilla
469646 lo convenc de que yo ten a que ir con l a hacer las entregas porque las cuentas no cuadraban como yo era el socio capitalista le toc aceptar en los primeros viajes nunca hicimos entregas a la guerrilla bamos a veredas o a cualquier otro lugar pero como l era el proveedor principal de ese frente era cuesti n de tiempo para que se les acabaran las cosas y nos tocara ir
469647 un d a me invit a tomar trago y me cont que les llevaba v veres y otras cosas a los guerrilleros obviamente dije que no le ve a problema a eso
469648 la primera vez que me llev los tipos guerrilleros estaban muy prevenidos y bravos con el due o del cami n yo me asust mucho porque esa vez me requisaron y hasta me hicieron empelotar aunque yo no ten a ning n equipo encima me preocupaba que hicieran lo mismo con el cami n y descubrieran las c maras
469649 yo me sentaba con ellos a tomar cerveza y a hablar carreta mientras descargaban el cami n una vez me dijeron que si quer a disparar un fusil de ellos me toc dejar que el fusil me pegara en la cara para mantener la fachada de que no ten a idea de armas me qued un morado y ellos estaban muertos de la risa
469650 al comienzo me encontraba con ella cuando la dejaban ir al pueblo y hac amos todo lo que hacen los novios
469651 el 24 yo le hab a dicho a jurga jurga que ten a que ir hasta el almac n a arauquita para hacer unas cosas pero no me dio permiso de salir del campamento yo no ten a c mo informarles a mis compa eros que yo todav a estaba ah yo no sab a c mo iba a ser el ataque y alcanc a pensar que mis propios compa eros me iban a bombardear

469660 its one thing to name naturalized players but to name a guy in a position where there are other mexicans who are as capable its not right
469661 leandro is a consummate professional he has played at high level for a number of years he is an indisputable starter for pumas but he is naturalized so he should be the last one considered not the first one
469662 people are lining up like hes a rock star marveled

469670 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
469671 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
469672 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step

469674 there are few things in life more heart warming than to be welcomed by a cat
469675 this is about protecting people from people who congregate for unlawful activity if their places were open to the public and open to the police like everyone elses there would be less likelihood of nefarious activity going on behind the walls

469680 if you want to heat your home with a heat pump you have to expect to pay for it
469681 while they can be cheap there are a number of factors that can make them use quite a lot of electricity
469682 especially in cooler climates like in southland if there are any reasons for inefficiency they could be exasperated
469683 in a poorly insulated home you are effectively throwing money away
469684 when no one is home it doesnt need to be warm and if it is the wrong setup it can put a lot of strain on the machine
469685 but there were a reasonable number of people surveyed who had a higher than expected power bill
469686 the right machine has to be installed in the right environment
469687 and you will find the thermostat will be gradually turned up higher and higher because it is so easy to the point you can just sit around in a t shirt and shorts

469697 its also helpful to realize that this very body that we have thats sitting right here right now with its aches and it pleasures is exactly what we need to be fully human fully awake fully alive
469698 an analogy for bodhichitta is the rawness of a broken heart sometimes this broken heart gives birth to anxiety and panic sometimes to anger resentment and blame but under the hardness of that armor there is the tenderness of genuine sadness this is our link with all those who have ever loved this genuine heart of sadness can teach us great compassion it can humble us when were arrogant and soften us when we are unkind it awakens us when we prefer to sleep and pierces through our indifference this continual ache of the heart is a blessing that when accepted fully can be shared with all
469699 we work on ourselves in order to help others but also we help others in order to work on ourselves
469700 when we start out on a spiritual path we often have ideals we think were supposed to live up to we feel were supposed to be better than we are in some way but with this practice you take yourself completely as you are then ironically taking in pain breathing it in for yourself and all others in the same boat as you are heightens your awareness of exactly where youre stuck
469701 if we learn to open our hearts anyone including the people who drive us crazy can be our teacher

469716 obama had been tied or ahead in 50 consecutive national polls through sunday

469718 i buy birth control pills for a long time now from the internet
469719 any time there is any discharge or leakage of radioactivity or radioactive water no matter how small we report it to local authorities
469720 determined that the weepage may have been occurring as far back as march when the ship was in sasebo japan and late may to mid june when the ship was in guam
469721 the amount of radiation that was in the water that leaked during those three port visits is actually less than what you would find in a 50 pound bag of common lawn fertilizer
469722 a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity
469723 filed some 6 500 pages of westinghouses technical design documents as the major component of applications
469724 reactor building control room cooling system engineering designs plant wide alarm systems piping and conduit
469725 all of these utilities seem to want standardization for the other guy not for themselves so most of them are making changes to the standardized designs says mariotte
469726 is that the nrc is still trying to go ahead and do licensing even with the designs not certified this is going to lead to a big mess later on
469727 instead of allowing a vote on the american energy act which would promote energy production conservation and innovation to bring down fuel costs they instead chose to simply skip town and leave americans on their own to pay the price
469728 if energysolutions and their nuclear zealot friends in congress are successful in pushing this agenda they stand to make hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in federal contracts doing that work
469729 if we can establish the recycling of spent nuclear fuel it will help facilitate increased use of safe clean nuclear power which is so important for the environment and for our nations efforts to lessen our dependency on foreign sources of energy
469730 this whole proposal is really just a boondoggle to make it look like weve done something to deal with the waste issue
469731 its not hard to figure how energysolutions has an economic benefit from this
469732 ive said to senior people at energysolutions if you guys really believe in reprocessing go out and spend stock they can go ahead and do it right now they cant do it if they need federal money to do it they know their shareholders and the stock market wont give them money to do that to me thats kind of the answer as to why reprocessing doesnt work
469733 for those of us that are still worried about a budget i stand and speak for them
469734 now is the time to quit talking about scapegoats and now find real solutions to the problems that affect real people
469735 they believe the way to get americans off gas and move the ball toward alternative energy is to make sure prices stay high
469736 they are an obstacle to every effort being made to increase supply
469737 in less than 15 days we have received information of the accidental contamination of 126 persons working in nuclear power plants
469738 this time uranium leaked for several hours before the authorities were warned and precaution measures were put in place
469739 confronted regularly with important irradiation increases the risks of contracting diseases associated with ionising radiation such as cancers and disorders affecting the human reproductive cycles
469740 we want that nuclear energy be one of the main answers to the oil crisis we are facing today
469741 all these accidents show that beyond the official incantations praising nuclear power this technology remains a source of pollution enormous dangers and very difficult to deal with
469742 i find it surprising that germans believe in contrast to all other industrialised nations that they can get by without nuclear power
469743 but there is nothing in the world not even love that is without risk
469744 we dont want to be just a sack of uranium
469745 the sale will undermine efforts to limit nuclear proliferation and will give sensitive nuclear technology to a brutal repressive and undemocratic regime
469746 whatever its human rights and corruption record may be kazakhstan so far has been practically a model non proliferation citizen in the international community
469747 the mining industry has migrated to these places because thats where the opportunities exist

469755 what we find most interesting is 47 percent are moving because they want a different floor plan or layout 43 percent want to move their primary residence to a beach bay or lakefront location and 41 percent want to move to be closer to recreational activities like golf swimming and tennis that tells us that these homeowners are moving more based on lifestyle not a particular life stage
469756 what constitutes a luxury amenity is evolving quite a lot
469757 high end kitchens and entertainment rooms now are givens in luxury living interestingly many of the items that are gaining in popularity all have to do with sports and maintaining a healthy lifestyle and these add ons dont come cheaply a regulation size tennis court can run as much as 60 000 or more

469763 it had looked quite good at the end of yesterdays practice and also this morning but on my last lap in q1 i had four cars in my way most of them at least tried to give me room but it still cost me time
469764 towards the end of the lap i had one car in front which was on an out lap he saw me and accelerated he then overtook s bastien bourdais before the last corner and then s bastien was right in my way i was hoping it was so obvious he would be penalised right away and i could still get into q2
469765 he complained several times about traffic on his last and important fast lap and missed getting into q2 we should be very happy if he scores a point from this grid position
469766 so youve got something in store for you see youve experienced some of these other things but you havent experienced god yet and thats the greatest of all experiences and id hate for you to miss it
469767 then jesus came from galilee to the jordan to be baptized by john but john tried to deter him saying i need to be baptized by you and do you come to me jesus replied let it be so now it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness then john consented
469768 i delight greatly in the lord my soul rejoices in my god for he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of his righteousness as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels for as the soil makes the sprout come up so the sovereign lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations
469769 at the end of all days when the king of kings comes back in all of his splendor there will not be time for you to recognize that the king of glory is here you will not have time to decide then whether or not you are going to bend your knee you will already be on your face because of his awesomeness
469770 yet you have a few people who have not soiled their clothes they will walk with me jesus dressed in white for they are worthy those who are victorious will like them be dressed in white i will never blot out their names from the book of life but will acknowledge their names before my father and his angels
469771 i am coming soon hold on to what you have so that no one will take your crown those who are victorious i will make pillars in the temple of my god never again will they leave it i will write on them the name of my god and the name of the city of my god the new jerusalem which is coming down out of heaven from my god and i will also write on them my new name
469772 republican operatives who follow texas congressional races concede that neither the 7th district nor the 10th will be the easy ride theyve been for the republicans since being redrawn in 2003 as part of the redistricting of lone star state house seats engineered by then house majority leader tom delay r texas
469773 even in texas one of the reddest states in the country people are fed up
469774 combine this desire for change with the strong campaigns both michael skelly and larry joe doherty are running and it offers democrats unique opportunities in texas this year

469778 when i will punish all who are circumcised only in the fles h egypt judah edom ammon moab and all who live in the wilderness in distant places for all these nations are really uncircumcised and even the whole house of israel is uncircumcised in heart
469779 this is what the lord says to his anointed to cyrus whose right hand i take hold of to subdue nations before him and to strip kings of their armor to open doors before him so that gates will not be shut i will go before you and will level the mountains i will break down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron i will give you the treasures of darkness riches stored in secret places so that you may know that i am the lord the god of israel who summons you by name for the sake of jacob my servant of israel my chosen i summon you by name and bestow on you a title of honor though you do not acknowledge me this is what the lord says the holy one of israel and its maker concerning things to come do you question me about my children or give me orders about the work of my hands it is i who made the earth and created human beings on it i will raise up cyrus in my righteousness i will make all his ways straight he will rebuild my city and set my exiles free but not for a price or reward says the lord almighty
469780 israel will be saved by the lord with an everlasting salvation you will never be put to shame or disgraced to ages everlasting
469781 you then why do you judge your brother or sister or why do you treat your brother or sister with contempt for we will all stand before gods judgment seat it is written as surely as i live says the lord every knee will bow before me every tongue will confess to god so then we will all give an account of ourselves to god therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another instead make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister i am convinced being fully persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but if anyone regards something as unclean then for that person it is unclean do not by your eating destroy your brother or sister for whom christ died for the kingdom of god is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness peace and joy in the holy spirit because anyone who serves christ in this way is pleasing to god and receives human approval let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification do not destroy the work of god for the sake of food
469782 do not destroy the work of god for the sake of
469783 but if our unrighteousness brings out gods righteousness more clearly what shall we say that god is unjust in bringing his wrath on us certainly not if that were so how could god judge the world someone might argue if my falshood enhances gods truthfulness and so increases his glory why am i still condemned as a sinner do we have any advantage not at all as it is written there is no one righteous not even one there is no one who understands there is no one who seeks god now we know that whatever the law says it says to those who are under the law so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to god therefore no one will be declared righteous in gods sight by observing the law rather through the law we become conscious of our sin but now apart from the law the righteousness of god has been made known to which the law and the prophets testify this righteousness is given through faith in jesus christ to all who believe
469784 because youre lazy youre a sloth and you get bored with god
469785 the lords justice will dwell in the desert his righteousness lives in the fertile field the fruit of that righteousness will be peace its effect will be quietness and confidence forever

469835 as things stand perhaps to look at an inflation rate of 8 9 per cent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009
469836 you can get a much lower rate of inflation if there is confluence of favourable factors such as moderation in oil prices and so on otherwise if the oil prices remain at the prevailing rate that is best estimate for inflation
469837 as far as growth is concerned it will slow down it will slow down than what we have experienced in previous years but nevertheless i think we can still hope to have gdp growth of economy between 7 5 to 8 per cent

469862 i really feel blessed to do what i do to represent the people of the state of minnesota in the united states senate
469863 ill talk about whats the path for dealing with that ill recognize weve made some mistakes we talked about being the party of fiscal responsibility but thats not what people saw coming out of washington
469864 we made some mistakes in iraq in terms of the process of war we were so concerned about the label of war for oil that we havent held the iraqis accountable enough for paying for their own reconstruction
469865 but ill also say that the path on the other side of raising taxes of cutting off trade of not supporting any kind of increased production of oil thats not a path to a brighter future we are still the party of hope and of opportunity
469866 someone who usually goes along with what president bush wants
469867 ive always been an independent voice and i take pride in that i try to do what i think is best for the people i represent bringing the experience and judgment to the table thats based on being in iraq many times listening to the people there
469868 whether im in the senate or anyone else is in the senate the pace of withdrawal is mostly going to depend on what we hear from commanders on the ground the goal which i think civilian leadership can articulate is to move us out as safely and quickly as possible but that end is not something thats motivated by an election date but by whats the right thing to do

469873 acknowledge the biblical norms on human sexuality and urge that within the anglican communion this may be upheld for the effective witness of the gospel
469874 we are saddened and disturbed by the fractured nature of the anglican communion today which seems to have been primarily caused by the issue of human sexuality
469875 we do feel the pain of the absence of some bishops who have kept themselves away from this fellowship
469876 we call upon the anglican communion to seriously take up this challenge and help to restore the dignity of the exploited and abused humanity they will certainly mean an equitable sharing of resources within the communion
469877 stand in solidarity with the marginalized and oppressed religious minorities

469903 subito nelle sinagoghe annuncia che ges il figlio di dio
469904 allimprovviso lo avvolse una luce dal cielo e cadendo a terra ud una voce che gli diceva saulo saulo perch mi perseguiti rispose chi sei o signore e la voce io sono ges che tu perseguiti

469954 two rivals a pumped up navy man and a heavyset bearded thug repeatedly beat each other nearly to death over the affection of a fickle skinny woman named olive however when performed realistically fists fly blood flows and this straightforward storyline transforms into a provocative look at how our society values violence the end product is brutal and harsh full of bottled up anger and regret and much closer in tone to sam shepard than the traditional saturday morning fare

469962 sen mccain i would have him serve in the role of loyal opposition in the minority
469963 its important to have an opposition that is keeping you on your toes and giving you a hard time and calling you out if youre not doing what you say youre going to do
469964 if i was presumptuous or taking this for granted i wouldnt be working this hard this week im beat
469965 so obviously we think that were in a tight race and we think that this is going to be a close race all the way through
469966 comment on the role liebermann would play in an obama administration
469967 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
469968 and if we can come up with a genuine bi partisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence then that is something i am open to
469969 i think is a positive step so there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bi partisan group
469970 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect for a drilling agenda
469971 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
469972 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional offshore drilling is wrong
469973 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
469974 and what that means is that were going to try to get things done at some point people are going to have to make decisions are we going to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
